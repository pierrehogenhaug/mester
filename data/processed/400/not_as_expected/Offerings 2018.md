Offering Memorandum, or any of its contents, must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum relates is
available only to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such
investments will be engaged in only with, relevant persons.

Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum nor the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes shall in
any circumstances imply that the information contained herein concerning the Issuer or the Guarantors
(together, the **Obligors) is correct at any time subsequent to the date hereof or that there has been no**
adverse change in the financial position of the Issuer or the Obligors as of any time subsequent to the date
indicated in the document containing the same. None of the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint
Bookrunners, the Financial Advisor, the Note Trustee, the Security Trustee or the other parties undertakes
to review the financial condition or affairs of any of the Issuer or the Obligors for as long as any Notes are
outstanding or to advise any investor in the Notes of any information coming to their attention.

This Offering Memorandum is not intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and
should not be considered as a recommendation by the Issuer, any member of the Group (as defined
below), Merrill Lynch International and HSBC Bank plc (the **Joint Global Coordinators), Deutsche**
Bank AG, London Branch, ING Bank N.V., London Branch and Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets plc
(together with the Joint Global Coordinators, the **Joint Bookrunners), N M Rothschild & Sons Limited**
(the **Financial Advisor), Deutsche Trustee Company Limited (the** **Note Trustee), Deutsche Trustee**
Company Limited (the **Security Trustee) or any of the other parties that any recipient of this Offering**

jurisdiction. The distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offer or sale of Notes may be
restricted by law in certain jurisdictions. The Issuer, the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint

**PRIIPS REGULATION / PROSPECTUS DIRECTIVE / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL**
**INVESTORS**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (EEA). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point
(11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, MiFID II); (ii) a customer within the meaning
of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended, the Insurance Mediation Directive), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified
investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended, the Prospectus Directive). Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the PRIIPs Regulation)
for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an
exemption under the Prospectus Directive from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of
Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Directive.

Each person contemplating making an investment in the Notes should make its own investigation and
analysis of the creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Obligors and its own determination of the suitability
of any such investment, with particular reference to its own investment objectives and experience and any
other factors which may be relevant to it in connection with such investment. A prospective investor who is
in any doubt whatsoever as to the risks involved in investing in the Notes should consult independent
professional advisers.

In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the Issuer and the
Guarantors and the terms of the Notes being offered, including the merits and risks involved.

The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Notes must
determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential
investor should:

- have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits
and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained in this Offering Memorandum;

- have access to, knowledge of and appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its
overall investment portfolio;

- have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes,
including Notes with principal or interest payable in one or more currencies or where the currency for
principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor’s currency;

- understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant
indices and financial markets; and

- be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the
applicable risks.

The Notes are complex financial instruments. Sophisticated institutional investors generally do not
purchase complex financial instruments as stand-alone investments. They purchase complex financial
instruments as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood, measured, appropriate addition
of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Notes which are complex
financial instruments unless it has the experience (either alone or with a financial adviser) to evaluate how
the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting effects on the value of the Notes and the
impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall investment portfolio.

In addition, the investment activities or certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and
regulations, or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal
advisers to determine whether and to what extent Notes are legal investments for it, Notes can be used as
security for indebtedness and other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial
institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate
treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

-----

The distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offering, sale or delivery of the Notes in certain
jurisdictions may be restricted by law. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes
are required by the Issuer, the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners to inform themselves
about and to observe any such restrictions. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute, and may not
be used for the purposes of, an offer to or solicitation by any person to subscribe or purchase any Notes in
any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such an offer or solicitation is not authorised or is
unlawful.

In connection with the issue of the Notes, Merrill Lynch International acting as stabilising manager (the
**Stabilising Manager) (or person(s) acting on its behalf) may over-allot Notes or effect transactions with a**
view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail.
However, there is no assurance that the Stabilising Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) will
undertake stabilisation action. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate
public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the Notes is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time,
but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the date of the issue of the Notes and 60 days after
the date of the allotment of the Notes. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the
Stabilising Manager (or person(s) acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules.

In connection with this new issue of Notes, the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners do
not act for or provide services, including providing any advice, in relation to this new issue of Notes to any
person other than the Issuer. The Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners will not regard any
person other than the Issuer, including actual or prospective holders of the Notes, as its client in relation to
this new issue of Notes. Accordingly, the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners will not be
responsible to anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections (regulatory or otherwise)
afforded to its clients.

If you are in any doubt about the contents of this Offering Memorandum you should consult your
stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other financial advisor. It should be remembered that
the price of securities and the income from them can go down as well as up.

In this Offering Memorandum, words denoting the singular number only shall include the plural number
also and vice versa.

Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any state securities commission or any other
regulatory authority has approved or disapproved these securities nor have any of the foregoing authorities
passed upon or endorsed the merits of this offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this offering
memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offence.

**MIFID II PRODUCT GOVERNANCE/PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET**
**MARKET**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a **distributor) should take into consideration**
the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**SETTLEMENT**

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in this Offering Memorandum under the section entitled ‘‘Notice to
Investors.’’

The Group expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be eleven business days
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as ‘‘T+11’’). Trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in three to five business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date
of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
initially will settle in T+11, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent

failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next
seven succeeding business days should consult their own advisors. See ‘‘Plan of Distribution.’’

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Presentation of Financial Information**

The financial information presented and discussed in this Offering Memorandum has, unless otherwise
indicated, been extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements of Arqiva Broadcast Parent
Limited as at and for each of the years ended 30 June 2016 (including unaudited comparative financial
information as at and for the year ended 30 June 2015), 30 June 2017 (including unaudited comparative
financial information as at and for the year ended 30 June 2016) and 30 June 2018 (including unaudited
comparative financial information as at and for the year ended 30 June 2017) (altogether, the **Financial**
**Statements), prepared and presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as**
adopted by the EU (IFRS) and presented in pounds sterling. The Financial Statements, the notes thereto
and the respective independent auditor’s reports are included in this Offering Memorandum starting at
page F-1.

The audited consolidated financial statements as at and for each of the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and
2018 have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent auditor of Arqiva Broadcast
Parent Limited.

The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates, and requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the
Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of management judgement or complexity,
or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial information are
disclosed in Note 4 to the Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The financial information set forth in this Offering Memorandum has been subjected to rounding
adjustments for ease of presentation. Accordingly, in certain instances, the sum of the numbers in a column
or a row in tables may not conform exactly to the total figure given for that column or row. Percentage
figures included in this Offering Memorandum have not been calculated on the basis of rounded figures
but have been calculated on the basis of such amounts prior to rounding.

Prospective Noteholders should read the Financial Statements of the Group and the notes thereto
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, together with ‘‘Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations’’._

Unless otherwise indicated, the financial results and information presented in this Offering Memorandum
is the historical consolidated financial information of Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited and not that of the
Issuer. See ‘‘Certain Definitions’’. The Issuer is a wholly owned subsidiary of Arqiva Broadcast Parent
Limited.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS measures and ratios, including EBITDA, EBITDA
margin, net cash inflow from operating activities, maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital
expenditure (contracted and non-contracted), which are not required by, nor presented in accordance with
IFRS. For a reconciliation of these measures, see ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated Financial Information.’’

The Group presents these non-IFRS measures because the Group believes that they and similar measures
are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental
measures of performance and liquidity. The non-IFRS measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures of other companies and have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Group’s operating results as reported under IFRS. Non-IFRS
measures such as EBITDA, EBITDA margin, net cash inflow from operating activities, maintenance
capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure (contracted and non-contracted) are not measurements
of the Group’s performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles.
In particular, investors should not consider EBITDA, EBITDA margin, operating cash flow after capital
and financial investment activities, maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure
(contracted and non-contracted) as an alternative to (a) operating profit or profit for the period (as
determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of the Group’s operating performance, (b) cash flows
from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of the Group’s ability to meet its cash needs
or (c) any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles.

These non-IFRS measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in
isolation, or as a substitute for an analysis of the Group’s results as reported under IFRS.

-----

**EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as operating profit (taken from the Group’s**
consolidated income statement data) before depreciation and amortisation, exceptional operating
expenses and one-off items where the earnings or charges are not considered to be indicative of the
Group’s on-going operations, e.g. profit or loss on the disposal of non-current assets.

**EBITDA margin, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as EBITDA divided by group revenue.**

EBITDA and EBITDA margin do not reflect and are not adjusted for:

- the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal
payments on the Group’s debts;

- any cash or non cash corporation taxes that the Group may incur;

- certain non-cash income and expense items that are reflected in the Group’s profit and loss statement
such as depreciation and amortisation; and

- the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters the Group considers not to be
indicative of its ongoing operations.

**Net cash inflow from operating activities, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as EBITDA**
before exceptional items, working capital and certain other items.

**Maintenance capital expenditure, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as expenditure that is**
incurred to deliver cost-savings, productivity enhancements, to extend the useful life of existing
non-current assets, or replace worn out and obsolete non-current assets with new ones in order to support
existing contracts.

**Growth capital expenditure—contracted, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as capital**
expenditure that is incurred to deliver new or renewal revenues and which is supported by a signed
customer contract.

**Growth capital expenditure—non-contracted, as used in this Offering Memorandum, is defined as capital**
expenditure that is incurred to deliver revenues and which is supported by a business case but on which
there is no signed customer contract at the time at which expenditure is incurred and reported.

Other companies in the Group’s industry may calculate EBITDA, EBITDA margin, net cash inflow from
operating activities, maintenance capital expenditure and growth capital expenditure (contracted and
non-contracted) differently from the manner that the Group does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative
measure.

**Projected EBITDA**

This Offering Memorandum also includes Projected EBITDA for the years ended 30 June 2019 and
31 December 2018. The Group is required to report Projected EBITDA further to the reporting covenants
under the Senior Financing (as defined herein). See ‘‘Selected Historical Consolidated Financial
_Information’’._

Projected EBITDA is based on management estimates, is not part of the Group’s consolidated financial
information or financial accounting records and has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by
independent auditors, consultants or experts. The Group’s use or computation of this metric may not be
comparable to the use or computation of a similarly titled measures reported by other companies in the
broadcast, media or communications industry. Projected EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or
as an alternative measure of performance or consistent with any performance measure under IFRS. This
metric is forward-looking information that is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause
the actual results and financial position of the Group to differ materially. Investors are cautioned to not
place undue reliance on such forecast data. See ‘‘Forward Looking Statements.’’

The prospective financial information included in this Offering Memorandum has been prepared by, and is
the responsibility of, the Group’s management. The Group and its management believe that Projected
EBITDA has been prepared on a reasonable basis, reflecting the best estimates and judgments, and
represent, to the best of management’s knowledge and opinion, the Group’s expected course of action.
However, because this information is highly subjective, it should not be relied on as necessarily indicative
of future results.

-----

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has neither audited, reviewed, examined, compiled nor applied agreed-upon
procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained herein and, accordingly,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on such
information or its achievability. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP assumes no responsibility for and denies any
association with the prospective financial information and any other information derived therefrom
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP reports included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum refer
exclusively to the Parent Guarantor’s historical financial information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
reports do not cover any other information in this Offering Memorandum and should not be read to do so.

**_Pro Forma Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes _pro forma consolidated financial data which has been adjusted to_
reflect certain effects of the sale of the Notes and the use of proceeds on the Group’s senior and junior
cash interest expense, gross senior and junior borrowings, cash at bank in hand, net senior and junior
borrowings, net senior and junior borrowings to EBITDA, cashflow to senior and junior cash interest
expense, senior cash interest expense, gross senior borrowings, senior cash at bank in hand, net senior
borrowings, net senior borrowings to EBITDA and senior cashflow to senior cash interest expense and
cashflow to senior and junior cash interest expense as at and for the year ended 30 June 2018. The Group’s
consolidated pro forma financial data has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport
to represent what the Group’s actual gross senior and junior borrowings, cash at bank in hand, net senior
and junior borrowings, net senior and junior borrowings to EBITDA, gross senior borrowings, senior cash
at bank in hand and net senior borrowings would have been if the sale of the Notes, the use of proceeds
and the Senior Financing had been completed as of 30 June 2018, or what the Group’s actual senior and
junior cash interest expense, cashflow to senior and junior cash interest expense, senior cash interest
expense, net senior borrowings to EBITDA, senior cashflow to senior cash interest expense and cashflow
to senior and junior cash interest expense would have been if the sale of the Notes, the use of proceeds and
the Senior Financing had occurred on 1 July 2017, nor does it purport to project the Group’s senior and
junior cash interest expense, gross senior and junior borrowings, cash at bank in hand, net senior and
junior borrowings, net senior and junior borrowings to EBITDA, cashflow to senior and junior cash
interest expense, senior cash interest expense, gross senior borrowings, senior cash at bank in hand, net
senior borrowings, net senior borrowings to EBITDA and senior cashflow to senior cash interest expense
and cashflow to senior and junior cash interest expense at any future date. The unaudited _pro forma_
adjustments and the unaudited _pro forma consolidated financial data set forth in this Offering_
Memorandum are based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that the Group
believes are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts.

**Orderbook**

The Group has also included in this Offering Memorandum certain information regarding its orderbook.
**Orderbook reflects management’s estimates of the Group’s potential future revenue to be derived from**
awarded contracts and reflects nominal values which have not been adjusted to represent net present
values. The Group believes that such information is reliable and based upon reasonable assumptions, but
this information has not been independently verified. The Group has made a number of assumptions in
compiling such information, including the following: (1) in respect of inflation, an adjustment based on the
Retail Price Index (RPI) has been applied to revenue under each long-term contract where appropriate;
(2) in respect of contract duration, (i) for contracts in the Satellite & Media division, Terrestrial Broadcast
division and M2M division, the full contract term has been applied and no early termination has been
assumed, (ii) for contracts in the Digital Platforms division, the Group has assumed that the contract will
be terminated at the first break-clause, and (iii) for site share contracts in the Group’s Telecoms division,
the Group has assumed that the term of the contract equals the unexpired licence term (and if such
licences have expired, the contracted period has been assumed to be the remaining contractual notice
period); and (3) in respect of pass-through cost clauses, (i) for contracts in the Telecoms division, rates,
electricity, and site access revenue were assumed as being contracted in line with the contracted site share
revenue, (ii) for contracts in the Terrestrial Broadcast division, electricity pass-through revenues are
included within the contracted revenue and (iii) for contracts in the Digital Platforms division, any cost
pass-through for Administered Incentive Pricing (AIP) has not been included given the uncertainty
regarding AIP.

Orderbook is derived from management estimates, is not part of the Group’s consolidated financial
information or financial accounting records and has not been audited or otherwise reviewed by
independent auditors, consultants or experts. The Group’s use or computation of this term may not be
comparable to the use or computation of a similarly titled measure reported by other companies in the
broadcast, media or communications industry. This term should not be considered in isolation or as an
alternative measure of performance. The Group cannot assure that these assumptions will be correct and
undue reliance should not be placed on such information. See also ‘‘Forward Looking Statements’’ for a
discussion of the risks related to forward-looking statements.

The Group confirms that the information from the above sources has been accurately reproduced and that
as far as the Group is aware no facts have been omitted which would render the reproduced information
inaccurate or misleading. Where third party information has been used in this Offering Memorandum, the
source of such information has been identified. None of the third party sources has made any
representation, express or implied, and has not accepted any responsibility, with respect to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, and none of the third
parties used as a source nor any of their affiliates, subsidiary companies, shareholders, directors or any of

These third-party sources generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable. However, these third-party sources also state that the accuracy and completeness of
such information is not guaranteed and that the projections they contain are based on significant
assumptions. As the Group does not have access to all of the facts and assumptions underlying such market

associations and other contacts within the industries in which the Group competes and (ii) in respect of
industry trends, the Group’s senior management team’s business experience and experience in the industry
and the markets in which the Group operate. The Group cannot assure you that any of the assumptions
that it has made in compiling this data are accurate or correctly reflect the Group’s position in its markets.

**BUSINESS OVERVIEW**

The Group is the UK’s pre-eminent national provider of television and radio broadcast infrastructure and
the leading independent provider of communications infrastructure to mobile network operators (MNOs)
in the UK. In addition, the Group has been an early participant in the development of
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) infrastructure in the UK through its smart water and energy metering
services and through other Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions. The Group is also a leading provider of
satellite uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of
channels available for UK DTH satellite broadcast. The Group’s unique and long-life asset base enables it
to generate revenues underpinned by long-term inflation-linked contracts, as demonstrated by a strong
orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018, with significant revenue visibility. Approximately 85.6% of the
Group’s actual revenues realised in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at 30 June
2017.

The Group operates through three main business units, which correspond to its three reporting segments,
except for its Other reporting segment, which includes non-revenue generating central corporate functions.

- _Terrestrial Broadcast—The Group benefits from a regulated position as the sole UK national provider_
of transmission services for digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting, the most popular
television broadcast platform in the UK in terms of the number of homes served. The Group operates
all television transmission sites used for DTT broadcasting in the UK, with over 1,100 sites covering
98.5% of the UK population. Through its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market
leader for the provision of access to the DTT platform for broadcast channels, owning two national
commercial DVB-T Multiplexes and a further two High Definition (HD) capable DVB-T2 Multiplexes
(DVB-T2 Multiplexes) used for transmission of DTT services in the UK. The Group’s DTT Multiplexes
carried 62 out of a total of 113 DTT channels in the UK as at 30 June 2018. DTT, through the
subscription-free platform, Freeview, enables the public service broadcasters (PSBs) to meet the
obligation under their licences to extend coverage to 98.5% of the UK population. The Group
believes that DTT has a long-term future as the most economic model to provide free-to-air (FTA)
television providing near-universal coverage in the UK, which it expects will be complemented, but
not replaced by, certain ‘‘over-the-top’’ (OTT) services. The Group believes that there will remain a
long-term need for a highly economic source of FTA linear TV available to the UK population and
believes that the DTT platform, as complemented by OTT services, is best placed to deliver this.

The Group also benefits from its regulated position as the leading UK national provider of radio
broadcast transmission services, covering both analogue and digital services through Digital Audio
Broadcast (DAB). The Group had radio network infrastructure comprising approximately 1,735
analogue transmitters and 990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites in the UK as at 30 June 2018. The
Group is also the operator of the two national commercial digital radio multiplexes (including through
JVs) and held 25 of the UK’s 57 local DAB radio licences as at 30 June 2018. Further, the Group is
the service provider for the BBC national digital radio Multiplex. The Group intends to support its
customers and the industry by continuing to develop digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for
listeners and planning for the expected eventual phase-out of analogue radio, rolling out DAB to fill
the remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default replacement network for analogue
services.

- _Telecoms & M2M—Through its Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the largest_
independent (i.e. not directly or indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites
in the UK, which the Group licenses to national MNOs and other wireless network operators to allow
them to provide services and coverage to their customers. The Group had approximately 8,000 active
licensed wireless sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. A significant proportion of
the Group’s active licensed wireless sites carried MNO equipment, which the Group estimates

16


-----

represented approximately 21% of the total active licensed MNO macrocell site market as at 30 June
2018. It holds a strong and difficult-to-replicate position in rural and suburban regions where cost,
economies of scale, planning permission restrictions, application regimes with local authorities and
the secure nature of site leases (given the landlord’s limited ability to terminate the lease) would make
it difficult for competitors and MNO customers to replicate the Group’s infrastructure and footprint.
In addition, the Group provides installation services for the passive components (such as antennas and
feeders) of network upgrades and roll-outs on its own wireless infrastructure sites. The Group is also
positioning itself to be a leading provider of outdoor small cells infrastructure, having obtained access
to street infrastructure in 14 London boroughs. In addition, the Group provides indoor and outdoor
Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) in the UK, with 46 in-building systems installed in UK locations
as at 30 June 2018. The Group is also a leading provider of smart metering and M2M networks, with a
long-term contract to provide smart metering communication services in northern England and
Scotland for electricity and gas to approximately 7.0 million premises with SMETS2 (the second
generation of Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications) devices by 2020. In addition, the
Group provides a smart metering network for Thames Water that is expected to cover three million
homes once fully deployed and has entered into a trial contract with Anglian Water for smart metering
deployment.

- _Satellite & Media—The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit is a leading provider of satellite_
uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of channels
uplinked for UK Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite broadcast. The Satellite & Media business unit
serves as an alternative for customers who do not wish to self-manage access, with an estimated
outsourced market share of approximately 48% of fully managed channels as at 30 June 2018. The
Group operates more than 80 uplink dishes in five teleports (ground stations that act as a hub to
connect a satellite network to a terrestrial telecommunications network), accessing more than
30 satellites and delivering media content to five continents. The Group also procures third party
ground-based teleport services where a line of sight to a satellite cannot be achieved from its UK
assets. This infrastructure enables the Group to provide customers with a comprehensive range of
services to deliver their data, broadcasts and media services internationally, focusing on the UK utility
sector, oil & gas sector, and aviation & maritime sectors. In addition, the Group provides encryption,
multiplexing, uplinking and satellite space to channel operators through its media distribution
offering. The Group also provides media management services, including linear playout (preparing
and transmitting content to distribution centres), video-on-demand, streaming, metadata management
and other OTT services. The Group also provides over 100,000 miles of cable for leased fibre
connectivity.

The Group has demonstrated revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years with revenue of
£884.0 million, £941.3 million and £962.4 million, and EBITDA of £428.4 million, £473.5 million and
£517.5 million, for the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

**_Competitive strengths_**

Arqiva believes that its success to date and its potential for future cash generation and growth are primarily
attributable to the following strengths:

_Unique and long-life asset base underpinning defensible market leading positions in all business areas_

The Group has an unrivalled Terrestrial Broadcast asset base, which Arqiva believes is not economically
feasible to replicate. The Group benefits from a regulated position as the sole UK national provider of
transmission services for DTT broadcasting, the most popular television broadcast platform in the UK in
terms of the number of homes served. It operates all television transmission towers used for DTT
broadcasting in the UK, with over 1,100 transmission sites covering 98.5% of the UK population. Through
its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market leader for the provision of access to the
DTT platform for broadcast channels, owning two national commercial DVB-T Multiplexes and a further
two HD capable DVB-T2 Multiplexes (out of a total of five main national commercial DTT Multiplexes).
The Group is a leading national provider of radio broadcasting transmission services, operating
approximately 1,735 analogue transmitters and 990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites, providing
coverage of up to 99% of the UK population as at 30 June 2018.

Within its Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the UK’s largest independent (i.e. not directly
or indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites, with approximately 8,000 active

17


-----

licensed wireless sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. The Group’s portfolio accounts
for approximately 60% of independent sites in the UK, approximately four times bigger than its nearest
competitor, and 21% of the total active licensed MNO macrocell site market. The Group’s long standing
history in the communications industry has enabled it to build a unique portfolio of prime position wireless
sites. As at 30 June 2018, approximately 65% of the Group’s active licensed sites had no near MNO
competitor, meaning no competitor site within 250 metres in urban areas, 500 metres in suburban areas or
750 metres in rural areas. The Group’s sites are critical to MNOs, enabling them to meet current and
future network coverage targets as imposed by Ofcom. The Group believes it has a highly defensible
position in rural areas, since economic feasibility and restrictive planning rules for new sites make it
challenging, but not impossible if a long-term investment horizon and business risk is taken, for
competitors to enter the market. In terms of urban infrastructure, which is evolving through new
technology such as small cells, the Group has also built up a leading position, winning access to street
infrastructure in 14 of the 16 London boroughs in which contracts have been tendered, with access to
approximately 230,000 sites. The Group also holds a nationwide licence in perpetuity in the UK’s largest
contiguous block of 2x224 MHz of 28 GHz spectrum, as well as a licence in perpetuity for a further
2x122 MHz of 28 GHz spectrum across London, acquired from Luminet in July 2017. The Group believes
this spectrum holding, and the Group’s compatible telecoms infrastructure, will be an increasingly valuable
asset. The Group has also positioned itself as a market leader in the UK for smart meter networks. It is
one of only two communication service providers for smart energy meter connectivity in the UK and a
leading provider for smart water meter connectivity. The Group believes its long-range radio solution
provides a more resilient solution and better penetration for smart metering, compared to cellular.

The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit is a leading operator in the fragmented satellite and media
market in the UK. The Group owns a significant asset base with 80 uplink dishes providing access to more
than 30 satellites owned by third parties and five teleports delivering media content to five continents,
supported by access to over 100,000 miles of leased fibre connectivity that enable the Group to deliver
reach to key media and broadcasting hubs in UK and around the world.

_Structurally stable underlying dynamics in the Group’s core markets_

The UK TV market is large and stable. Within this market, the Group serves the FTA segment via the
DTT platform. DTT, through Freeview, remains the most popular TV viewing platform in the UK, with the
highest adoption rate of all platforms at 70% of all households with at least one TV set (Source: BARB;
Ofcom). The UK DTT platform is supported by a number of important favourable structural drivers,
including the cultural role it plays in delivering live TV to viewers and its high relevance to broadcasters
and advertisers given the platform’s wide reach and strong political support (FTA viewing is popular
amongst the key voting demographics), as well as the difficulty of replicating coverage and access by other
means. The Group has the most efficient platform in the UK capable of enabling the PSB to meet their
98.5% universal coverage obligations imposed by Ofcom, making its infrastructure ‘‘mission critical’’ to the
PSBs. Shows on PSB stations continue to attract the highest viewing in the UK. In the week commencing
23 July 2018, all 50 of the UK’s 50 most watched programmes were on FTA DTT channels
(Source: Thinkbox). The Group believes there is also presently no credible replacement technology to DTT
which would rival DTT’s ability to provide universal coverage, its reach and installed base, and its ability to
deliver content free at the point of access. The role of DTT is not expected to change in the medium term,
as demonstrated by the UK Government’s renewal of the Royal Charter until at least 2028 and its
commitment to continue providing free broadcasting, and Ofcom has publicly stated its commitment to
DTT until at least 2030.

In recent years, the UK has seen the emergence of alternative viewing platforms such as hybrid DTT/IPTV
and OTT platforms. These platforms can be complementary with DTT, while offering competition to
traditional pay platforms which are broadcast through Satellite or Cable. The proportion of homes with
pay-digital satellite has fallen from 35% in 2011 to 31% in the first quarter of 2018, after peak uptake in
2010 (Source: BARB). Hybrid platforms leverage the reach and cost effectiveness of DTT to deliver the
FTA services with interactive services typical of IP, such as catch-up and on-demand. The increase in ‘‘pay
lite’’ services (e.g. Netflix, Amazon) gives consumers further optionality to combine DTT with a cheaper
OTT offering. This trend also supports the Satellite & Media division, which has been providing IP streams
and VoD processing services since 2015 and has over the past two years invested in cloud-based delivery
services.

The Group is also the leading independent provider of passive telecoms infrastructure, a position which
the Group expects to strengthen as MNOs continue to extend their networks. The UK is currently ranked
36[th] globally in terms of 4G availability and 41[st] in terms of 4G speed. The Group plays a key role in the
MNOs’ coverage solution due to its unique site portfolio. In addition, exponential mobile data traffic
growth is forecasted to continue, which will require a significant increase in network capacity. In order to
increase coverage and capacity, in particular for 5G where small cells are likely to be a key technology,
MNOs will have to invest in their networks benefiting infrastructure providers such as Arqiva.

_Highly secure revenue underpinned by long term inflation-linked contracts_

The Group has significant revenue visibility with an orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018,
representing more than five times coverage of revenues for the year ended 30 June 2018. The orderbook is
underpinned by the Group’s established relationships with its high-quality customers. Long-term contracts
provide the Group with a high degree of visibility over a significant portion of its expected annual revenue
at the commencement of each financial year. Approximately 85.6% of the Group’s actual revenues realised
in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at 30 June 2017.

The Group has a diverse, blue-chip customer base across all business units, including all the UK’s PSBs
(BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5), and major international broadcasters (e.g. Discovery, Turner, ESPN),
major radio groups (BBC, Global Radio, Bauer Media), major smart metering customers (Data
Communications Company (the **DCC) and Thames Water) and all the UK’s MNOs (EE, Three, O2,**
Vodafone and their JVs, Mobile Broadband Network Limited (MBNL) and Cornerstone
Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (CTIL)). These established long-term relationships
demonstrate the importance of Arqiva’s assets and infrastructure to its customers. Certainty over contract
renewals is supported by limited viable alternatives, as well as the ‘mission critical’ nature of the services
that Arqiva provides, leading to significant switching costs and operational risks for customers.

Within the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit, DTT transmission contracts are typically over 20 years in
original duration. Moreover, the Group’s DTT transmission contracts are inflation-linked, and otherwise
set so as to deliver a fixed rate of return relative to the underlying asset base. The PSBs have been willing
to sign long-term agreements with the Group for DTT broadcast, given the Group’s position as the only
provider capable of meeting PSB coverage obligations and the PSB licences, which obligate them to use
the Group’s DTT network. As a result of these features of the contractual terms and the fact that there are
no scheduled regulatory reviews of customer contracts once contractually agreed, the Group benefits from
a degree of long-term revenue visibility. Digital Platforms contracts are typically three to six years in
duration. Radio contracts within the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit are typically eight to 12 years in
original duration and are often inflation-linked. Within the Satellite & Media business unit, contracts are
typically three to five years in duration and are partially inflation-linked. Within the Telecoms & M2M
business unit, telecoms contracts are typically seven to ten years in original duration and inflation-linked,
and smart metering contracts can be up to 15 years in original duration and inflation-linked. The
commercial terms of the Group’s Telecoms contracts are structured to encourage MNOs to add more
equipment to sites. As MNOs increase the amount of equipment in place on Arqiva sites, the total rental

19

-----

fee per site increases, subject to MNO-specific contract terms, as does the opportunity cost of moving sites,
making these contracts and subsequent revenues increasingly ‘‘sticky’’.

7SEP201817043203

_Strong cash conversion combined with a resilient business provides sustainable cashflows_

The Group is able to convert its stable contracted revenues into cash, achieving strong cash flow
conversion throughout 2016 to 2018, despite reaching a peak in its investment cycle over the same period.
In addition, EBITDA margins have improved over the same period as the Group has made progress on its
efficiency programmes.

Capital expenditure is expected to decline after 2018 as the major capital expenditure requirements
relating to the roll out of projects such as smart metering and the current phase of DAB roll-out projects
are completed, significantly enhancing cash conversion. The majority of the capital expenditures for the
Group’s smart metering contracts with the DCC and Thames Water have been completed, as the networks
have been mostly built. In addition, the commercial terms of these contracts mostly allow for capital
expenditures to be paid upfront, and any change request payments are mostly pre-paid against delivery
milestones. All major capital expenditure programmes are directly linked to contracts in place, keeping
speculative capital expenditure to a minimum. The Group has achieved tight control over its maintenance
capital expenditure, contributing to cash conversion on an EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure
basis of approximately 95% over recent years.

The Group’s underlying business and long-term nature of its contracts as well as its cash earning track
record is evidenced by the Group’s investment grade rating at the senior level.

The Group is currently implementing a company-wide transformation programme to streamline processes,
modernise IT systems and achieve third-party cost efficiencies. The Group believes this programme, aimed
at achieving efficiencies and reducing costs by optimising the Group’s cost base and driving margin
improvements by reducing overhead, consolidating business units into a more efficient structure and other
initiatives, will continue to result in improvements in the efficiency of Group operations and further
headcount efficiencies as major projects complete.

_Experienced management team and workforce partnered with a supportive shareholder base comprised of key_
_experienced infrastructure players_

The Group is managed by a highly experienced senior management team with a breadth of Telecoms
experience including tenures at Nokia, ICL, GEC, BT, KCOM and Cable & Wireless. The Group’s
divisional heads have an average of 25 years’ industry experience and a proven track record in their
respective areas. The Group also benefits from a highly talented workforce with approximately 700 skilled
engineers. Further, management have brought significant operating experience to the Group, focusing on
driving margin improvement through implementing a comprehensive cost transformation programme.
Their increased and continuing focus on efficiency initiatives has already seen impressive results,
contributing to EBITDA growth.

The Group is owned by a consortium of seven shareholder groups. The Group’s largest shareholders are
Frequency Infrastructure Communications Assets Limited (of which CPP Investment Board is an 86%
shareholder), Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II, Conyers Trust Company (Cayman) Limited in
its capacity as trustee of the IFM Global Infrastructure Fund, First State Super, Motor Trades Association
of Australia Superannuation Fund (advised by Whitehelm Capital) and two Macquarie-affiliated
minorities (Macquarie Global Infrastructure Funds 2 S.`a r.l. and Macquarie Prism Proprietary Limited).

**_Business strategies_**

The key components of the Group’s strategy are as follows:

_Maximise value of strong core business and infrastructure_

(a) Terrestrial Broadcast

The Group’s DTT platform and radio networks are the UK’s leading platforms for delivery of TV and
radio in the UK. The Group works closely with customers and is a member/shareholder in industry
organisations (such as Digital UK, Freeview, YouView and Digital Radio UK) which influence the strategy
and product development of the networks.

The Group’s strategy is to reinforce DTT’s long-term position as the most popular TV platform in the UK
by continuing to support the development of the hybrid DTT/IPTV platform (which can be accessed
through DTT sets capable of connecting to the internet or through a set top box), which is expanding the
range of catch-up services available as well as serving the needs of a pay-lite audience base. By continuing
to work with industry organisations, the Group aims to support the uptake of platforms that utilise DTT as
a core FTA delivery mechanism and improve the viewer experience through improved content discovery
and seamless integration of new types of content. The Group also aims to expand HD and SD channel
choice, thereby maximising Arqiva-owned DTT Multiplex utilisation, and work with the TV manufacturing
market through Digital UK and Freeview to ensure that the hybrid DTT/IP services remain the default
technology.

The Group’s radio networks are utilised by more than 49 million adults in the UK every week. Where the
Group is the licensed DAB multiplex operator, the Group intends to continue to assess options to expand
the coverage of its networks as well as the range of channels available to give listeners the best possible
DAB experience. The Group intends to support its customers and the industry by continuing to develop
digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for listeners and planning for the expected eventual phase-out
of analogue radio, rolling out DAB to fill the remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default
replacement network for analogue services. The Group expects that it would be able to reduce its costs
following any eventual Digital Radio Switchover (DRS), given that DAB transmission equipment is more
reliable than analogue and will require fewer maintenance visits, and DAB transmission uses less power
than analogue.

(b) Telecoms & M2M

The Group intends to continue to pursue its current strategy, seeking to strengthen its position as the UK’s
leading independent telecom sites provider by increasing the Group’s site portfolio. The Group’s strategic
sites transfer programme is on track, with a number of sites already assigned and a number of site transfers
in process. See ‘‘Business—Business Units—Telecoms & M2M Business Unit—Telecoms—Licensed sites
_portfolio’’. The Group is actively pursuing the legal assignment of the remaining sites and expects to_
complete the majority of transfers prior to the deadlines. The Group’s strategy is also to increase each
site’s tenancy by number of points of presence (POP) (i.e. any separate MNO relationship on a single site)
to heighten tenant retention and achieve higher site share fees. Taking into account the sites and POP
being transferred, the Group’s MNO site count has increased by 12% to approximately 6,668 for year
ended 30 June 2018 (compared to 5,929 in the year ended 30 June 2016), and the Group has increased its
MNO POP by 10% to 16,311 as at 30 June 2018 (compared to 14,814 in the year ended 30 June 2016). In
parallel, the Group will continue to focus on commercial relationships and remain the trusted partner for
its blue-chip customers (such as Vodafone and the other MNOs, as well as BT and Airwave). The Group
intends to build on its existing urban macro site portfolio and establish Arqiva as the predominant UK
provider of urban wireless telecom infrastructure by also installing MNO equipment on Arqiva street
infrastructure from exclusive concessions in prime locations. The Group also intends to explore the
potential to provide additional value-add services on its existing sites.

In the M2M space, the Group plans to leverage its existing communications technology (from the DCC
and Thames Water contracts) for the potential roll-out of new smart metering contracts (such as the trials
with Anglian Water) and additional M2M applications.

(c) Satellite & Media

The Group plans to continue to improve operational efficiency and service excellence within the
Satellite & Media business unit, and intends to take advantage of international growth opportunities

22


-----

served by its UK infrastructure and virtualised capabilities. The Group aims to help broadcasters and
rightsholders navigate and exploit the trends underlying the video market, including ‘‘hybrid’’ consumer
behaviour, increasing operational complexity and the need for operational and commercial flexibility. The
Group plans to do this through the expansion and development of its media management services and
distribution capabilities. The Group will also continue to focus on providing high levels of operational
efficiency and service excellence, including through its InSite e-service capability which was launched in
2018 and provides real-time service interaction and data to customers via electronic interfaces.

_Continue to leverage investment in wireless sites and explore small cells opportunities through active engagement_
_with mobile network operators to increase revenue sources_

The Group believes it is positioned to be a key beneficiary of the forecast increase in mobile data and from
the associated roll-out of 4G upgrades (4.5G and 4.9G) and ultimately 5G. As 5G is rolled out and demand
increases, higher frequency spectrum, such as 3.5 to 3.8 GHz, will need to be used resulting in a focus on
street level deployment to bring the network closer to the end user. The Group expects its passive
infrastructure to play a key role in providing solutions for coverage and capacity. For example, small cells
will be needed to densify the network in urban areas where new macro sites cannot easily be built. The
Group intends to continue to position itself at the forefront of the small cells roll-out, securing exclusive
long-term concessions for the use of street level infrastructure for small cell installation and is currently
undertaking initial MNO deployments. The Group has already contracted with two MNOs for initial
low-volume small cells roll-out, which are currently in progress.

The Group believes it is well positioned to capitalise on additional growth opportunities, including with
regards to its tower portfolio and potentially as a partner with alternative fixed network operators for fibre
backhaul to support outdoor small cells and 5G FWA solutions in the longer-term.

_Simplify and standardise business in order to optimise operational costs and efficiency_

The Group intends to maintain its focus on delivering comprehensive cost transformation, building on its
progress since 2014 and driving efficiencies and operational excellence across the organisation. The cost
savings programme is largely underpinned by detailed execution programmes and headcount efficiencies
are expected to be realised as the large delivery programmes reach completion and headcount delivery
programmes are realised. Delivery of savings is overseen by the FutureFit project management office and
the Group’s senior management team.

In addition, the Group may from time to time undertake disposals of assets in line with its strategy to exit
sub-scale businesses and focus on core offerings.

_Maintain a stable long term capital structure_

The Group has de-leveraged significantly since the 2013 bond issuance. Senior leverage (calculated using
an EBITDA of £525 million, which is used for covenant purposes) has been reduced from 5.6x to 4.4x
between 31 December 2012 and 30 June 2018, and total leverage has been reduced from 7.0x to 5.5x over
the same period. This reduction in leverage reflects the decision by shareholders to prioritise re-investing
in the company over making distributions. For example, the Group has successfully completed a number of
major capital programmes over the past five years, including smart metering and DAB roll-out, which are
now generating significant recurring cashflows. Shareholders have not taken any distributions over this
period. With the level of capital expenditure investment expected to fall over the coming years,
shareholders may consider regular distributions consistent with maintaining a stable long term capital
structure and investment grade senior debt ratings.

**_Recent Developments_**

The Group expects to appoint Michael William Darcey as a Director and as a member of the Nominations
Committee in September 2018. Mr Darcey has over 25 years of experience in the technology, media and
telecommunications industry with numerous positions held ranging from CEO of News International to
COO of British Sky Broadcasting Group. Mr Darcey has also provided strategic advisory services to a
range of clients in the media industry. Mr Darcey has served or is currently serving on the boards of Dennis
Publishing (UK) Ltd (Chairman), M24Seven (Chairman), Home Retail Group (Senior Independent
Director) and Sky New Zealand. Mr Darcey holds an MSc Economics, Microeconomics & Capital Markets
from the London School of Economics. Mr Darcey’s appointment is subject to CPP Investment Board
approval.

**_Shareholders_**

The Group is owned by a consortium of seven shareholder groups. The Group’s shareholders are
Frequency Infrastructure Communications Assets Limited (of which CPP Investment Board is an 86%
shareholder) (48.0%), Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II (25.0%) and two Macquarie-affiliated
minorities (Macquarie Global Infrastructure Funds 2 S.`a r.l. and Macquarie Prism Proprietary Limited,
which together hold 1.5%), Conyers Trust Company (Cayman) Limited in its capacity as trustee of the IFM
Global Infrastructure Fund (14.8%), First State Super (5.4%) and Motor Trades Association of Australia
Superannuation Fund (advised by Whitehelm Capital) (5.2%). These percentages are as at the date of this
Offering Memorandum.

**TRANSACTION OVERVIEW**

In conjunction with the offering of the Notes hereby, the Group is refinancing the Issuer’s outstanding
£600,000,000 of 9.50% Senior Notes due 2020 (the Existing Issuer Debt).

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will be issued by Arqiva Broadcast Finance plc (the **Issuer), a sister company of Arqiva**
Financing No 2 Limited (AF No 2 and the **Intermediate Guarantor) pursuant to a trust deed (the** **Note**
**Trust Deed) and guaranteed by the Intermediate Guarantor and the holding company of the Issuer and the**
Intermediate Guarantor named Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited (the **Parent Guarantor) and Arqiva**
Broadcast Intermediate Limited (Intermediate HoldCo and, together with the Intermediate Guarantor
and the Parent Guarantor, the Guarantors and the Guarantors together with the Issuer, the Obligors).

The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the Senior Financing discussed in ‘‘Overview of Senior
_Financing and Shareholder Financing’’. As such, the only cash available to service the Notes and any further_
indebtedness of the Obligors (other than Subordinated Debt) (together the Junior Debt) will be permitted
distributions by the Senior Financing Group to Intermediate HoldCo and distributions by Intermediate
HoldCo to the other Obligors. See ‘‘Risk Factors—The Issuer and the Guarantors are special purpose vehicles
_and have limited assets and limited ability to generate revenue and will depend on their subsidiaries and_
_affiliates to provide them with funds to meet the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes’’._

**_The Intercompany Loans and Use of Proceeds_**

The proceeds of the Notes will be on-lent by the Issuer to AF No 2 under an intercompany loan agreement
between them (the **Intercompany Loan Agreement and the loans by the Issuer (in its capacity as**
Intercompany Lender) to AF No 2 (in its capacity as Intercompany Borrower thereunder), the
**Intercompany Loans). AF No 2 will use the proceeds of the Intercompany Loans to repay in full (together**
with the related make-whole premium of £14.3 million) and terminate the £600.0 million of existing
intercompany loans which were provided by the Issuer to AF No 2 from the proceeds of the issuance by the
Issuer of the Existing Issuer Debt (the **Existing Intercompany Loans). The Issuer will use the proceeds**
from the repayment by AF No 2 of the Existing Intercompany Loans to (i) redeem the Existing Issuer
Debt in full (together with the related make-whole premium of £14.3 million), (ii) to pay any related
transaction fees and expenses of £8.0 million and (iii) to fund cash on the Group’s balance sheet of
£2.7 million to be used for general corporate purposes. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’.

**_The Obligors_**

The Obligors are non-operating holding companies with no material, direct business operations. The
principal assets of the Guarantors are the equity interests they directly or indirectly hold in companies in
the Senior Financing Group. As a result, the Guarantors are dependent on loans, interest, dividends and
other payments from their Subsidiaries (mostly the main operating companies in the Group, such as
Arqiva Limited and Arqiva Services Limited) to generate the funds necessary to meet their financial
obligations, including, in the case of the Intermediate Guarantor, the repayment of any Intercompany
Loans.

**_Transaction Security_**

The Noteholders and any other Secured Creditors will share the benefit of a common security package
(the **Transaction Security) granted by the Obligors pursuant to the security agreement in favour of the**
Security Trustee (the Security Agreement). As part of the Transaction Security, each of the Issuer and the

24


-----

Guarantors will grant first ranking fixed and floating charges over, among others, all moneys standing to
the credit of their respective bank accounts and shares held by such Obligor (including, in the case of the
Parent Guarantor, the shares held by it in each of AF No 2 and the Issuer, in the case of the Intermediate
Guarantor, the shares held by it in Intermediate HoldCo and, in the case of Intermediate Holdco, the
shares held by it in the Senior Parent), together with a floating charge over all (or substantially all) of their
respective assets, in support of their obligations under the Guarantees (with respect to the Guarantors)
and the Notes (with respect to the Issuer).

permitted business covenants in the Common Terms
Agreement.

Furthermore, the Conditions will restrict the ability of members
of the Group (that are not the Issuer or the Guarantors) to
make restricted payments.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions, including intra-Group transactions.
For a more detailed description of these covenants, please see
‘‘Terms and Conditions’’.

**Redemption for Tax, Illegality and**
**Other Reasons: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If at any time the Issuer satisfies the Note Trustee that:

(a) by reason of a change in law (or the application or official
interpretation thereof), which change becomes effective on
or after the Issue Date, the Issuer would, on the next
Interest Payment Date, become obliged to deduct or
withhold from any payment of interest, premium or
principal in respect of the Notes (other than in respect of
default interest), any amount for or on account of any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature imposed, levied, collected,
withheld or assessed by the UK or any political subdivision
thereof, or any other authority thereof or any change in the
application or official interpretation of such laws or
regulations;

(b) the Issuer or any Paying Agent would be required to deduct
or withhold any amount from any payment in respect of any
Notes pursuant to FATCA;

31


-----

(c) the Intercompany Borrower would on the next Interest
Payment Date be required to make any withholding or
deduction for or on account of any Taxes from payments
under the Intercompany Loan Agreement in respect of any
Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes; or

(d) by reason of a change of law (or the application or official
interpretation thereof), which change becomes effective on
or after the Issue Date, it has or will become unlawful for
the Issuer to perform any of its obligations under the
Intercompany Loan Agreement in respect of any
Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes or to fund
or to maintain its participation in any Intercompany Loan
corresponding to the Notes,

then the Issuer may, upon giving not more than 15 and no less
than five Business Days’ prior written notice to the Note Trustee
and the Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions, redeem
all (but not some only) of the relevant class of the Notes at any
time, in an amount equal to the principal amount outstanding of
the Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

**Withholding Tax on the Notes: . . . . .** All payments in respect of the Notes will be made (whether by
the Issuer, any Guarantor, any Paying Agent or the Note
Trustee) without withholding or deduction for, or on account of,
any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or charges of
whatsoever nature unless the Issuer, any Guarantor, any Paying
Agent or the Registrar or, where applicable, the Note Trustee is
required by applicable law to make any payment in respect of
the Notes subject to any withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or
charges of whatsoever nature. In that event, the Issuer, such
Guarantor, such Paying Agent or the Note Trustee, as the case
may be, shall make such payment after such withholding or
deduction has been made and shall account to the relevant
authorities for the amount so required to be withheld or
deducted, but without limitation to _Condition 6.3 (Redemption_
_for Taxation or Other Reasons). The Issuer or, as the case may be,_
the Guarantors shall (subject to the terms of _Condition 8_
_(Taxation)) be obliged to pay additional amounts to the_
Noteholders as a consequence of such withholding or deduction.

**Purchase of the Notes: . . . . . . . . . . .** The Issuer or any Guarantor may at any time purchase Notes in
the open market or otherwise and at any price.

All Notes that have been redeemed or purchased by the Issuer
must, or all Notes purchased by any Guarantor may at its option,
be surrendered by the Issuer to any Paying Agent and/or the
Registrar for cancellation.

Any Notes so surrendered for cancellation may not be reissued
or resold and the obligations of the Issuer in respect of any such
Notes shall be discharged and there will be a deemed repayment
of the corresponding Intercompany Loan.

For the avoidance of doubt, any other Group Company (as
defined in the Terms and Conditions), Holding Company or
Subsidiary of any Holding Company that is not a Group
Company may also purchase Notes (without such surrender and
cancellation), but would also be unable to vote on such Notes.

**Note Trustee: . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Deutsche Trustee Company Limited will act as trustee for the
Noteholders (in such capacity, the Note Trustee).

32


-----

required to cover interest and scheduled principal and other scheduled amounts (as applicable) payable by
the Senior Borrower on the Senior Borrower Bank Facilities and by the Senior Issuer on the Senior Notes
(as defined below) and amounts ranking pari passu or senior thereto in accordance with the applicable
payment waterfalls of the Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer.

_Senior Capex Facility and Senior Working Capital Facility_

Borrower, the CTA and the STID) (the Senior Issuer Security) in favour of a security trustee appointed by
and acting on behalf of the holders of the Senior Notes, the Senior Liquidity Facility Providers (in their
capacity as lenders to the Senior Issuer) and other secured creditors of the Senior Issuer.

**_Senior FinCo_**

Arqiva Senior Finance Limited (having the same meaning as ‘‘FinCo’’ for the purposes of the Common
Terms Agreement (Senior FinCo)) is a sister company of the Senior Borrower and, as is the case with the
Senior Issuer, sits outside of the Senior Financing Group. Senior FinCo previously entered into term
facilities and on lent the proceeds to the Senior Borrower. The term facilities entered into by Senior FinCo
have since been repaid in full and terminated together with the intercompany loans between Senior FinCo
and the Senior Borrower and all related hedging and security. The disclosure of the Senior Financing is
this Offering Memorandum is presented on this basis. Senior FinCo does not undertake any other
activities. In the event that Senior FinCo incurs any future financial indebtedness, Senior FinCo would on
lend the proceeds to the Senior Borrower under an Authorised Facility. Any Authorised Facility would be
subject to the terms of the Senior Financing and Common Documents.

**_Senior Hedging_**

The Senior Borrower has a swap portfolio comprising interest rate hedges (the **Senior Interest Rate**
**Hedges), cross-currency hedges (the** **Senior Currency Hedges), overlay hedges (the** **Senior Overlay**
**Hedges) and inflation-linked hedges (the** **Senior Inflation-Linked Hedges and, together with the Senior**
Interest Rate Hedges, Senior Currency Hedges and Senior Overlay Hedges, the Senior Hedges, the
agreements under which such Senior Existing Hedges are provided, the Senior Hedging Agreements and
the counterparties thereunder, the Senior Hedge Counterparties).

The Senior Inflation Linked Hedges and Senior Overlay Hedges rank senior in point of payment and
security to (among other things) the Senior Borrower Facilities. The Senior Interest Rate Hedges and
Senior Currency Hedges rank pari passu in point of payment and security to (among other things) the
Senior Borrower Facilities.

The Senior Issuer or the Senior Borrower (as applicable) may enter into new Senior Hedges from time to
time as may be required to ensure compliance with the hedging policy of the Senior Issuer and the Senior
Borrower.

No hedging is permitted for speculative purposes, but the Senior Borrower may enter into general foreign
exchange trades or interest rate risk management trades in the ordinary course of business.

**_Overview of Senior Hedges_**

As at 30 June 2018, the Group had a hedging portfolio with a notional amount of approximately
£3.1 billion. This portfolio comprises approximately:

- £1.3 billion notional amount of inflation linked swaps (ILS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;

- £0.6 billion notional amount of overlay swaps (OS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;

- £0.2 billion notional amount of cross-currency swaps (CCS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;
and

- £1.0 billion notional amount of IRS to which the Senior Borrower is party.

_Senior Borrower ILS and Senior Borrower OS_

The existing ILS (which have a total notional amount of approximately £1.3 billion) are used to hedge the
Group’s high proportion of index-linked turnover. The mark-to-market value on the ILS is linked to future
expectations of inflation. As the Group’s long-term contracts are closely linked to the RPI, higher inflation
tends to increase future turnover and offsets the impact of mark-to-market deterioration on the ILS over
the life of the swap.

In addition, the Senior Borrower has entered into approximately £0.6 billion notional amount of floating/
fixed interest rate swaps (i.e. OS) to overlay the ILS (with no mandatory break and having a floating
receive leg of six month GBP LIBOR) and thereby amend the net cash flow characteristics.

Approximately £1.1 billion notional amount of ILS after directly or in conjunction with a portion of the OS
(£0.4 billion notional amount) effectively hedges the Senior Issuer’s and the Senior PP Issuer’s fixed rate
GBP coupon payments under the existing fixed rate Senior Notes and the existing fixed rate GBP tranche
of the Senior USPP Notes, respectively. The remaining £0.2 billion notional amount of ILS in conjunction
with the CCS and a portion of the OS (£0.2 billion notional amount) effectively hedges the Senior PP
Issuer’s cross-currency exchange rate and interest rate risk in respect of the existing U.S. dollar tranche of
the Senior USPP Notes.

Approximately £1.1 billion of the ILS do not have mandatory breaks and so will mature on their scheduled
maturity date falling in 2027. The remaining £0.2 billion of the ILS have a mandatory break date falling in
2023. At that mandatory break date, these ILS will automatically terminate and the Senior Borrower will
be obliged to pay any termination costs. The termination costs for the Senior Borrower will be linked to
the mark-to-market value of such portion of the ILS at such time. The Senior Borrower expects to fund the
potential termination costs with cash and/or further Senior Debt. Alternatively, the Senior Borrower may
be able to extend the mandatory break, subject to an incremental credit charge and the willingness of the
relevant Senior Hedge Counterparties that are counterparties under the ILS in extending such break. The
mandatory breaks were introduced to optimise the rate paid by the Senior Borrower under the ILS. None
of the OS have any mandatory breaks and so will mature on their scheduled maturity date (subject to any
scheduled amortisation, if applicable).

On the ILS, the coupon is paid in cash at each semi-annual payment date and is accounted for in the
Senior Historic Cashflow ICR and the Senior Projected Cashflow ICR (together, the **Senior ICRs). The**
accretion amount to the notional amount which is determined by indexation to inflation is counted as
Senior Net Debt in the Senior Historic Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Senior Projected Net Debt to
EBITDA Ratio, but not in the Senior ICRs.

The Senior Borrower is required to pay down accretion amounts every year until maturity of the ILS. The
Senior Borrower expects to fund this payment from available cash and/or the incurring of new Senior Debt.

The accretion payment on the ILS is calculated according to the following formula:

{([RPI (3 month lag) / 201.6 � 1] � ILS notional) minus the sum of all previous accretion payments}.

The interest payments on the ILS are calculated according to the following formula:

{[RPI (3 month lag) / 201.6] � ILS notional � real rate � fraction of year}

Management estimates that, as at 30 June 2018, the mark-to-market value on the ILS was approximately
£0.8 billion and the PV01 (as explained below) on the ILS was approximately £1.8 million. The PV01
represents the present value of adding one basis point to the fixed rate payable by the Senior Borrower and
is a function of interest rates and time (which means that the PV01 will vary from time to time).

_Senior Borrower CCS_

The Senior Borrower has entered into U.S.$0.4 billion notional amount of CCS to fix the sterling cost of
future interest and capital repayment obligations relating to the U.S. dollar tranche of the Senior USPP
Notes at an exchange rate of USD1.52:GBP1.00.

_Senior Borrower IRS_

The Senior Borrower has entered into approximately £1.0 billion notional amount of IRS to hedge the
floating rate payable by the Senior Borrower under the Senior Group’s floating rate GBP debt, specifically
the Senior Institutional Term Loan, the Senior EIB Loan, the Senior Term Facility and the floating rate

39


-----

GBP tranches of the Senior USPP Notes. None of the Senior Borrower IRS contains any mandatory break
provisions and instead the maturity date of each such Senior Borrower IRS corresponds to the scheduled
maturity of the aforementioned Senior Debt that it hedges (subject to any scheduled amortisation, if
applicable).

The Senior Borrower IRS represents restructured legacy instruments, meaning that the fixed rate payable
by the Senior Borrower is higher than it would be had the Senior Borrower entered into new swaps on
on-market terms when the derivative instruments were established.

**_Senior Common Documents_**

Each of the Senior Borrower Bank Facilities and the Senior Issuer/Borrower Facilities are subject to
common representations and warranties, covenants, trigger events, events of default and intercreditor
arrangements set out under a CTA, the STID and the MDA setting out the terms used therein including, in
particular, the ratios set out in the table ‘‘—Senior Financial Covenant Ratios and Senior Trigger Events’’
below.

**_Senior Financial Covenant Ratios and Senior Trigger Events_**

Please also see ‘‘Description of Certain Financing Arrangements’’.

**Overview of Shareholder Financing**

In addition to the Senior Financing and funds provided pursuant to the issue of the Notes, certain
shareholders in Arqiva Group Limited provided Arqiva Financing No 3 plc with funding in the form of
unsecured shareholder loan notes (the **SLNs), issued in two classes in an aggregate principal amount of**
£1,054 million. The proceeds of the SLNs are structurally subordinated to the Senior Financing and funds
provided pursuant to the issue of the Notes. All SLNs are listed on the International Stock Exchange
(Channel Islands) and are repayable between 2024 and 2025. There is no call
option which allows the holders to require early redemption.

The SLNs carry a fixed rate of interest ranging between 13% and 14%, however all accrued interest has
been deferred. £1,094 million worth of payment-in-kind (PIK) loan notes have been issued to some, but
not all, of the shareholders in satisfaction of certain amounts of deferred interest. The PIK loan notes rank
pari passu in right and priority of payment with the deferred interest under the existing class of notes to
which they relate. A balance of £839 million remains as at 30 June 2018 in relation to deferred and accrued
interest not satisfied by the issuance of PIK notes. Any further interest accrued on the SLNs from the
period beginning 30 June 2018 also remains outstanding. Shareholder Loan Notes refers to the SLNs, the
PIK notes and all associated deferred and accruing interest.

(1) EBITDA is presented to aid understanding of the Group’s results of operations and financial condition. The Group defines
EBITDA as operating profit (taken from the Group’s consolidated income statement data) before depreciation and
amortisation, impairment charges, exceptional administrative expenses and one-off items where the earnings or charges are not
considered to be indicative of the Group’s on-going operations, e.g. profit or loss on the disposal of non-current assets, as well
as certain other items.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, nor presented in accordance with, IFRS.
EBITDA is not a measure of performance under IFRS and investors should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to
(a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of the Group’s operating
performance, (b) cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure to meet the Group’s cash needs or
(c) any other measures of performance under IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should exercise
caution in comparing EBITDA as reported by the Group to EBITDA of other companies.

EBITDA has been included in this Offering Memorandum because it is a measure that the Group’s management uses to assess
the Group’s operating performance. Please see ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures’’ for information on the limitations of EBITDA as an analytical tool._

(4) The Group defines maintenance capital expenditure as expenditure that is incurred to deliver cost-savings, productivity
enhancements, to extend the useful life of existing non-current assets, or replace worn out and obsolete non-current assets with
new ones in order to support existing contracts.

(5) The Group defines growth capital expenditure—contracted as capital expenditure that is incurred to deliver new or renewal
revenues and which is supported by a signed customer contract.

(6) The Group defines growth capital expenditure—non-contracted as capital expenditure that is incurred to deliver revenues and
which is supported by a business case but on which there is no signed customer contract at the time at which expenditure is
incurred and reported.

(7) _Pro forma senior and junior cash interest expense is calculated as follows: (i) consolidated cash interest expense for AF No 2 for_
year ended 30 June 2018 of £ million less (ii) cash interest costs associated with the existing junior and senior bank
facilities (including derivative instruments) being refinanced for the year ended 30 June 2018 of £ million plus
(iii) estimated cash interest costs associated with the Notes offered hereby, the junior and senior bank facilities and the Senior
Notes (including derivative financial instruments) of £ million. Excludes non-cash interest expense and any interest
expense related to intercompany indebtedness. For the avoidance of doubt, this excludes principal accretion on the ILS.

(8) _Pro forma gross senior and junior borrowings is senior and junior indebtedness before debt issuance costs excluding deeply_
subordinated amounts due to parent undertaking as of 30 June 2018 (which was £2,892.0 million) adjusted to give _pro forma_
effect to the refinancing, the offering of the first series of Senior Notes and the offering of the Notes hereby.

(9) _Pro forma cash and cash equivalents is cash and cash equivalents as of 30 June 2018 adjusted to give_ _pro forma effect to the_
refinancing and the offering of Notes hereby. Under the Conditions, the Group is required to maintain sufficient cash within
the Issuer to cover six months interest on the Notes offered hereby. It is the Group’s intention that any cash in excess of this is
held in the Senior Financing Group.

(10) Pro forma net senior and junior borrowings is _pro forma gross senior and junior borrowings less_ _pro forma cash and cash_
equivalents as of 30 June 2018.

(11) Calculated using an EBITDA of £525 million, which is used for covenant purposes.

(12) Cashflow is calculated as EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure, amounts of net corporation tax paid, amounts of
Issuer Profit Amount payable.

**BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY RISKS**

**_Demand for the Group’s broadcast, communications and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) infrastructure could_**
**_decline_**

The Group is the UK’s pre-eminent national provider of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and radio
broadcast infrastructure as well as a leading independent provider of communications infrastructure to
mobile network operators (MNOs) in the UK, which it typically provides under long-term, high value
contracts. Therefore, factors adversely affecting the demand for such infrastructure in general could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s customers and therefore on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations, particularly over the medium and long term as such contracts come up
for renewal. Such factors could include:

- a decrease in consumer demand for broadcast and telecommunication services due to adverse general
economic conditions or other factors, including changing consumption habits by end consumers,
including their adoption of alternative content distribution technologies such as Internet Protocol
(IP);

- a deterioration in the financial condition of broadcasters generally due to declining advertising
revenues (including as a result of a shift to internet advertising), declining viewership, media
convergence, ‘‘over-the-top’’ (OTT) (i.e. IP delivered) market disruption or other factors;

- a reduction in public funding for the BBC, or a variation in Public Service Broadcaster (PSB) charters
or programmes affecting such PSBs in terms of funding, purpose and coverage requirements;

- a slowdown in the uptake of Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) services by consumers or in the roll-out
of DAB by the UK government or radio industry, which could impact the attractiveness of DAB to
radio broadcasters and listeners, or a reduction in the overall radio market in favour of IP delivered
music and radio content;

- a decrease in the ability or willingness of telecommunication service providers to maintain or increase
operating or capital expenditures, including as a result of intense competition among MNOs or a
consolidation of MNOs, lack of prioritisation of investment in the UK by multinational MNOs or a
change in coverage requirements;

- a decrease in the growth rate of telecommunication services in the UK generally or of a particular
area of the telecommunications sector, including a delayed and decreased demand for small cells,

49


-----

other urban densification-driven demand and willingness to invest in the expansion of rural capacity
and coverage;

- adverse developments with respect to regulatory licensing of spectrum and changes in broadcast and
telecommunications regulations, including delays or changes in spectrum auctions;

- mergers or consolidations among broadcasters, content providers or MNOs;

- changing strategies of telecommunication service providers with respect to the ownership,
consolidation or sharing of passive infrastructure, or increased use of network sharing or resale
arrangements by telecommunication service providers among themselves;

- adverse developments with regard to planning permission for locations where the Group’s
infrastructure is located or where the Group would prefer to locate future infrastructure, as well as
applicable environmental, health, tax and other government regulations;

- delays or changes in the development of new technologies, and/or technological changes which allow
MNOs to use fewer or smaller antennas or to deploy fewer small cells;

- the failure by the Group to anticipate the development of new technologies or to decommission old
technologies; and

- competition from a new entrant to the towers market, whether through the acquisition of existing
towers and/or the development of new towers.

In the long-term, a deterioration in demand for the DTT platform may occur, either due to increased
viewership of television programmes delivered via alternative platforms such as IP or cable; or reduced
demand from advertising-funded, transactional or news channels. In addition, there may in the future be a
loss of spectrum allocated for the DTT platform and radio due to strategic decisions by Ofcom and the
European Commission in favour of alternative uses of spectrum (e.g. by MNOs) and IP delivery of
television services, including by the PSBs. This could have an impact on the number of available DTT
multiplex licences and adversely effect the Group’s ability to sell streams through its Digital Platforms
division.

In its Terrestrial Broadcast division, DTT faces competition for digital broadcast media from competing
platforms, such as satellite, cable, Internet Protocol television (IPTV) delivered over broadband or OTT,
which may emerge as technically superior or otherwise appealing alternatives. For example, satellite
television broadcast, which has been expanding its range of services, now offers Ultra-High Definition
(UHD) and currently offers more High Definition (HD) channels than DTT, which could increase the
viewer appeal of satellite broadcasts in relation to DTT. OTT providers have also been expanding their
range of HD and UHD content. In the event consumers shift away from their reliance on DTT for
television and turn in greater numbers to these, or other, alternative platforms, such a shift could
negatively affect the long-term profitability or sustainability of DTT. Should DTT’s share of the television
delivery platform market decline as a result of greater uptake of alternative television delivery platforms, it
could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. With respect to radio, in the medium to long-term DAB could be challenged or replaced as the
primary means of broadcasting digital radio content by internet radio or another medium. This could also
result in fewer resources being devoted to DAB in terms of new sites or expansion of coverage which would
negatively impact the Group’s business.

In its Digital Platforms division, which sells DTT broadcast capacity to broadcasters, the Group faces
direct market competition from S4C Digital Networks (SDN), the owner of the only national commercial
DTT Multiplex in the UK not owned by the Group. Additionally, should alternative platforms or forms of
delivery of television services, such as satellite, cable, IPTV or OTT expand and challenge DTT’s market
position, it could reduce the general demand for DTT Multiplex capacity and negatively impact the prices
the Group is able to achieve. The Group could also face competitive pricing changes if new technology or
increased spectrum availability were to significantly affect supply of, or demand for, Multiplex capacity.

In the Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group currently operates a significant share of the independent
(i.e. non-MNO owned) wireless sites in the UK. However, MNOs may in the future elect to use a higher
proportion of their own sites, rather than use those available from independent site providers such as the
Group. With respect to network densification and capacity enhancement, demand for equipment additions
to the Group’s wireless sites and small cell locations may be affected by the challenging economics of the
UK mobile market or the emergence and adoption of alternative technological solutions. Macro based

50


-----

capacity upgrades may also result in lower utilisation levels of the Group’s street level small cell locations.
Recent revisions to the Electronics Communications Code (ECC) require landlord rental to be based on
the commercial value of land and may make new site deployment easier to achieve for not only Arqiva, but
also MNOs/JVs and other independent tower operators. Although the Group is currently protected from
these provisions in the ECC on its own sites/infrastructure, use of the provisions by MNOs could increase
Group site churn and reduce demand for additional sites or antennas/equipment if MNOs or other
independent tower operators can develop new build sites more easily.

Any change in government policy or regulation, disruption to the existing M2M technology, delays or
difficulties faced by customers in the adoption of smart meters, adverse impact to the end-to-end service
(in terms of quality or features) due to its high complexity, poor performance of the overall service,
negative media coverage, the affordability of such technology or reputational damage resulting from a
security breach with regard to the communications hubs or smart meters linked to the Group’s smart
metering networks could have a material adverse effect on demand for the Group’s M2M business.

In its Satellite & Media business unit, Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite faces competition from other
platforms, such as DTT, cable, IPTV delivered over broadband or OTT, which may emerge as technically
superior or otherwise appealing alternatives. In the event consumers or the platform operators shift away
from the reliance on DTH/satellites as a means of distribution for television and turn in greater numbers to
these, or other, alternative platforms, such a shift could negatively affect the long-term profitability or
sustainability of DTH. If DTH’s share of the television delivery platform market declines as a result of
greater uptake of alternative television delivery platforms or the platform operators decision to change
distribution technologies, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Any decline in demand for the Group’s broadcast, telecommunications and M2M infrastructure
attributable to one or several of the factors listed above could have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to UK government and other regulations that govern the way it conducts its businesses, and the_**
**_effects of, or changes in, regulations and government policy could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s_**
**_business, financial condition and results of operations_**

The Group is subject to a wide range of regulations that govern the way it conducts its businesses, and the
effects of, or changes in, regulations and government policy could have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

_Terrestrial Broadcast—Undertakings:_ The Group’s provision of broadcast transmission services is
regulated by Ofcom and is subject to a set of undertakings (Undertakings) accepted by the Competition
Commission (now its successor, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)) and overseen by the
Office of the Adjudicator—Broadcast Transmission Services (OTA-BTS), appointed by and reporting to
Ofcom. Contract prices for the provision of Network Access (NA) services are set within the framework of
a reference offer (a NA Reference Offer). Under a NA Reference Offer, the Group is allowed to make a
fixed rate of return equivalent to a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.71% (real pre-tax) on a
pre-2015 regulated asset base used for NA services and a 7.5% WACC (real pre-tax) on post-2015 new
capital assets. Should the regulated pricing framework change, or if the WACC is adjusted by the
OTA-BTS in the future (whether due to a change in the broadcast transmission market, an alteration to
the Group’s capital structure or a deviation in the pricing methodology in connection with the WACC,
which in each case could cause the OTA-BTS to review the WACC), it could reduce the returns the Group
would receive on its broadcast infrastructure assets, and therefore result in a decrease in future revenues.
In addition, the Group’s broadcast transmission services contracts are Retail Price Index (RPI) linked,
which may not accurately reflect the drivers of the Group’s cost base over time, including as a result of any
future changes to the components used to calculate the RPI. If the Group’s cost base growth outgrows RPI
growth, its revenues and operating profits on its terrestrial broadcast assets may be adversely impacted.

The regulated framework also allows any of the Group’s broadcast customers to be repaid up to 10% of
payments made to the Group in any one year or receive equivalent service credits (which can be used to
offset payment for services provided by the Group) in the event the Group persistently fails to meet the
contracted service level agreement (SLA) targets and fails to subsequently remedy the failure within the
one month cure period, or in more limited instances, to terminate their contract or to activate break
clauses that terminate the relationship at a future date prior to the completion of their contracts. Although

51


-----

to date, the Group has not had any agreements terminated for failure to meet SLA targets and service
credits have been minimal, there is no assurance that in the future this will not occur.

As the Group is the sole UK provider of national terrestrial broadcast infrastructure necessary for DTT
and the leading national provider of terrestrial broadcast infrastructure necessary for radio transmission in
the UK, and since the Group’s Digital Platforms division is a customer of the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast
division, the Undertakings also require the Group to impose strict information barriers between the
Terrestrial Broadcast division and the Digital Platforms division, and subject the Group to regular audit. A
breach of these Undertakings, competition law or the Group’s regulatory obligations could give rise to a
range of potential penalties including fines of up to 10% of the Group’s annual revenue and, in exceptional
circumstances, structural remedies including the enforced sale of components of the Group.

_Digital Platforms—Multiplex licences:_ The Group’s DTT and radio broadcast operations are highly
dependent on the Group’s multiplex licences (Multiplexes), granted under the Broadcasting Act 1996, and
related commercial spectrum licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, each as issued by Ofcom.
The Group’s DTT Multiplexes are particularly material to the Group’s business, and are granted for
specified time periods. The Group’s two current DTT DVB-T Multiplex licences expire in 2026, but the
Group’s two DTT DVB-T2 Multiplex licences can be revoked on 24-months’ notice in order to allocate the
spectrum to other uses. Ofcom has recently served notice on the DVB-T2 licences meaning that the licence
will end in June 2020. However, Ofcom may permit services to continue after that date, through a new
licence arrangement, if there is no demand from MNOs for the use of the spectrum. Any failure to renew
the two main DVB-T Multiplex licences or failure to obtain replacement capacity upon expiry of the
DVB-T2 Multiplex licences may adversely affect the Group’s business. In addition, the Group may be
exposed to capacity losses as a result of Ofcom re-designating any DTT Multiplex licence held by the
Group for a purpose other than DTT or changing technical specification requirements resulting in capacity
loss. Should the Group be unable to maintain licences providing sufficient broadcasting spectrum capacity,
there may be a corresponding reduction in the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast business, which could have a
material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

_Digital Platforms—Spectrum fees:_ In 2013, Ofcom announced a potential framework for introducing
spectrum rental fees under an Administered Incentive Pricing (AIP) scheme to encourage efficient
spectrum use. Although Ofcom has, to date, decided to refrain from applying opportunity cost-based AIP
pricing to broadcast spectrum and has stated that it does not envisage applying AIP-based fees until 2020,
it is possible that AIP pricing will be implemented in the future. In the interim period from late 2014 to
2020, Ofcom has charged and is expected to continue to charge administrative cost-based fees to Multiplex
operators, including the Group, based on Ofcom’s direct costs associated with managing spectrum and the
administration of broadcast licences. Although these fees have been and are expected to remain modest
until 2020, the Group believes that there is a likelihood that it may have to pay significantly higher fees
beyond 2020. These fees could prove significant, and could be increased once they are announced and
implemented. Although the Group expects to pass through a proportion of any AIP fee to its customers,
and includes AIP clauses in its current contracts, the Group may not be able to fully pass these costs on to
all of its customers or include similar clauses in future contracts without adversely affecting demand for the
Group’s Multiplex services. The imposition of AIP fees could therefore impact the Digital Platforms
division’s profitability or reduce the competitiveness of the DTT platform relative to competing platforms
(such as DTH satellite, cable, IPTV or OTT), which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

_Telecoms—Site Sharing:_ The licensing, construction, operation, sale, resale and interconnection
arrangements for the Group’s mobile wireless sites in the UK, and the wireless industry the Group services
through those operations, are regulated to varying degrees. For example, the Group is required to obtain
planning permissions to erect new masts and is subject to planning regulations with regard to its site
development. In addition, the Group’s sites may be subject to taxes or other regulatory charges imposed by
local authorities. Any of the authorities with jurisdiction over the Group could adopt or change rules or
regulations or take other actions that could make it more difficult or costly for the Group to conduct its
site sharing business or impact the revenues it earns, and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

_Telecoms—Spectrum:_ The Group owns a nationwide licence in perpetuity for spectrum in the 28 GHz
band, which has been trialled for connectivity using 5G Fixed Wireless Access (FWA). In addition, the
Group acquired an additional 28 GHz spectrum licence from Luminet in 2017. Use of the 28 GHz band for
5G FWA is dependent on ratification by the Third Generation Partnership Project and amendment of the

52


-----

Group’s licence by Ofcom, each of which may not occur in the medium term or at all, which could
adversely impact the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations over the longer term.
The Group is also currently developing strategic propositions to leverage its 28 GHz spectrum assets,
including the possible deployment of a street level trial in partnership with ISPs and MNOs, which may not
be successful.

_Telecoms—Street Infrastructure:_ The Group’s street infrastructure concessions are regulated by local
authorities. As such, any change to the relevant city or borough’s policy or regulations may impact the
ability of the Group to renew the concessions on favourable terms or at all, which could have a material
adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group has
exclusivity periods for 13 of the 14 boroughs for which it has concessions, of which 11 will expire before the
end of the contracted concession period (which extend through 2018 to 2022). The delay in small cell take
up from MNOs has increased the risk that the Group may fail to retain exclusivity in these areas or that the
Group may need to pay more to retain exclusivity. In addition, the application of the ECC to concession
agreements is currently unclear and a successful formal challenge by MNOs for direct access to the street
infrastructure could reduce the Group’s ability to monetise these concessions successfully.

_M2M—Smart Metering:_ The Group has been building a smart metering communication network in the
north of England and Scotland as part of a 15-year contract signed in September 2013 with the DCC, which
is licensed by the UK government. The DCC is also supervised by the Office of Gas and Electricity
Markets (Ofgem), the energy regulator. Any change to the UK political environment may cause the
Secretary of State to vary the licence conditions, and/or materially change the overall programme and
these changes in turn may be passed down to the Group and result in additional costs or an adverse effect
on the Group’s ability to provide its services.

_Satellite & Media:_ The licences required to transmit satellite signals on the relevant frequency and for
relevant satellites and teleport licences are regulated by Ofcom in the UK and by relevant regulatory
authorities in other jurisdictions where the Group operates. Although the Group believes it is currently in
compliance with all of its material regulatory obligations in respect of its Satellite & Media business, the
Group may fail to remain in compliance with such obligations in the future. Changes in laws, regulations or
government policy affecting the Group’s Satellite & Media activities such as decisions by regulators as to
the granting, amendment, renewal, revocation or termination of licences or broadcast agreements, could
be adopted that make compliance more difficult or expensive. For example, the UK’s decision to exit the
European Union (Brexit), of which the European Council was formally notified on 29 March 2017, may
make it more difficult for the Group’s clients to distribute channels from UK teleports into Europe,
specifically with regard to compliance with the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2010/13/EU). As at
the date of this Offering Memorandum, it is unclear what regulatory framework will apply to the Group’s
satellite DTH customers who hold a UK licence and uplink from the Group’s UK teleports, but seek to
transmit content lawfully into EU member states.

If regulatory changes impact any of the Group’s businesses and thereby impair the Group’s ability to
provide its products, or current regulations obstruct the Group’s current business or future projects
undertaken by the Group, such regulatory change could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group or its customers may be unable to secure spectrum in the future, which would prevent or impair the_**
**_Group’s plans or limit the need for the Group’s services and products_**

The Group’s ability to provide services to its broadcast customers, in particular, is highly dependent on the
Group’s access to sufficient spectrum and, in the longer term, the replacement and renewal of its existing
spectrum licences for the long-term competitive strength of DTT as a broadcast platform relative to other
platforms for delivery of television services. However, the amount of available spectrum suitable for the
Group’s operations is limited and the process for obtaining it is complex. The Group therefore cannot
guarantee that it, or its multiplex operator customers, will have sufficient access to spectrum in the
long-term to maintain and develop its services.

If the UK government and Ofcom, who manage spectrum in the UK, reduce the spectrum available for
DTT as a broadcast platform, the Group’s Digital Platforms business could have less DTT spectrum
available to it and thus could offer fewer channels to its commercial broadcaster customers. For example,
the Group’s DTT platform currently uses spectrum in the 470-790 MHz bands. Ofcom and Industry
stakeholders are implementing plans to clear the 700 MHz band (694 MHz to 790 MHz) so that it can be

53


-----

auctioned for use by MNOs. Although historically the Group has been able to optimise spectrum capacity
on its Multiplexes through improvements in compression technology, there can be no assurances that any
additional capacity as a result of technology upgrades will be sufficient to compensate for any loss of any
spectrum currently in use for DTT or that will be used after the completion of 700 MHz clearance, or that
the Group would be able to obtain replacement spectrum on acceptable commercial terms. Such a
spectrum reduction could limit the number of streams the Group can provide, undermining the Group’s
ability to meet the demand from broadcasters for Standard Definition (SD) and HD services, or other
emerging spectrum-intensive broadcast technologies such as UHD TV, on DTT in the UK.

Failure to meet future customer and viewer demand for SD channels, additional HD channels or other
spectrum-intensive products could diminish the long-term competitiveness of DTT relative to competing
platforms such as satellite, cable, IPTV and OTT, and adversely impact the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operation. Both Ofcom and European institutions have indicated long-term
support for spectrum protection for DTT until at least 2030. Long-term availability of spectrum for
broadcasting beyond 2030 is expected to be decided primarily at an international level, as a result of
substantive decisions that are currently expected to be made at the 2023 or other future World
Radiocommunication Conferences as to how much spectrum will be allocated exclusively to the sector for
the longer term.

The Group also may need to obtain additional spectrum capacity to either support existing contracts, such
as its smart metering contract with the DCC or its Satellite & Media contracts, or to support future
developments in the industry. There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to obtain the
appropriate spectrum at an economic rate for either the company or its customers or at all. Even if the
Group is able to obtain additional spectrum, there can be no assurances that the UK government and
Ofcom will not re-designate other low frequency satellite spectrum in the future as a result of uses
associated with low frequency technology. For example, the 412 MHz band will be subject to an AIP review
with Ofcom in 2021, which could result in additional cost to continue to own and utilise the spectrum.
Failure by the Group to secure spectrum at an economic rate or at all in the future could have a material
adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is dependent on its technical and information infrastructure and a significant security breach or other_**
**_critical disruption in the Group’s technical or information infrastructure could result in material harm to the_**
**_Group’s performance, harm the Group’s reputation, and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations_**

The Group relies on sophisticated technical and information technology infrastructure to operate its
business and deliver critical services to its customers (including operation of its infrastructure,
management of key networks, accounting, billing and other matters), as well as to accurately and efficiently
provide information to management and prepare financial reports. The Group’s systems are also an
important means of internal communication and communication with customers and suppliers. These
systems and services are vulnerable to interruptions or other failures resulting from, among other things,
software, equipment or telecommunications failures, processing errors, computer viruses and malware,
fraud, hackers or other security issues or supplier defaults, natural disasters and terrorist attacks. For
example, a breach of information security could impair the ability of the Group to adequately provide its
services, cause financial loss, reduce performance by one or more of the Group’s businesses or damage the
Group’s reputation. Additionally, a security breach or intrusion upon the Group’s information technology
infrastructure could compromise the security of information stored in or transmitted through the Group’s
systems (including customer data and broadcast transmissions), or compromise the integrity of the Group’s
technical systems more broadly. The Group provides a significant proportion of the UK’s critical national
communications infrastructure. If the Group’s smart metering networks are subject to cyber-attacks, it
could cause a material loss of, or damage to, data or systems, which may have a material adverse impact on
the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

While the Group seeks to protect its computer systems and network infrastructure from physical intrusion
as well as security breaches and other disruptions that could affect the Group’s telecommunication and
information infrastructure and the Group maintains a ‘‘cyber’’ insurance policy, its security, backup and
disaster recovery measures may not be adequate or implemented in a manner which fully prevents such
errors, processing inefficiencies, or security breaches, and as a result the Group may face an inability to use
the systems or process transactions, suffer financial loss, or experience loss of customers or other business
disruptions. To provide its various services, the Group may allow clients and customers to access certain
elements of the Group’s data and telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of permitting such access,

54


-----

the Group’s technical or information infrastructure could be attacked or compromised. While the Group
takes extensive measures to maintain the security of these externally-facing networks, it is impossible to
completely eliminate the risk created by the need for customer access to the Group’s information
infrastructure. There can be no assurance that the Group’s security measures will be adequate or
successful, and the costs of maintaining adequate security measures may increase substantially in the
future. Any such breach, or actions taken to repair or prevent a breach, could result in significant cost to
the Group or harm the ability of the Group to successfully compete in one or more of its businesses, which
could in turn have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. See ‘‘—The Group must comply with data protection regulations’’.

**_The Group is exposed to certain risks in respect of the development, expansion and maintenance of its broadcast and_**
**_wireless telecommunications infrastructure, including the need for on-going capital expenditure, which could have a_**
**_material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations_**

The Group’s ability to maintain a high level of service depends on its ability to develop, expand and
maintain its infrastructure, requiring substantial amounts of capital and other long-term expenditures,
including those relating to the renewal, optimisation or improvement of existing networks, and upon its
ability to obtain sufficient financing to facilitate these projects.

Capital expenditure amounts have varied significantly from year to year on the basis of the Group’s
expenditures for renewals, new projects and planned expansion expenditures. For example, the Group’s
700 MHz clearance programme, smart metering programme and the roll-out of DAB equipment across the
Group’s network have required significant capital expenditure in the three most recent financial years. The
Group’s 700 MHz clearance programme and smart metering programme are expected to continue to
require significant capital expenditures at least until the end of 2020. The Group may be subject to
additional significant capital expenditure requirements going forward, should it decide to invest additional
capital expenditure on new projects as technology develops, if the completion of its existing capital
expenditure projects is delayed or if regulatory requirements, changes to contractual arrangements with
customers or competitive processes require investment in additional technology or infrastructure. Further,
the Group may be unable to generate revenues from new assets or products resulting from such capital
expenditure, or their revenues may be insufficient to cover the associated construction and development
costs.

In the past, the Group has financed these expenditures through a variety of means, including internally
generated cash flows, external borrowings (including under its credit facilities or from some of its
customers, e.g. Ofcom) and shareholder contributions. In the future, the Group expects to utilise a
combination of internally generated cash flows and external banking and capital markets transactions to
meet its planned capital expenditure requirements and such financing may be more costly or otherwise
more difficult to obtain. The Group’s ability to obtain such financing to fund its capital expenditures could
in the longer term be limited by, among other causes, its leverage, its then-current or prospective financial
condition or results of operations or its inability for any reason to raise bank debt or to issue securities in
the capital markets on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that financing from
external sources will be available on commercially reasonable terms at the relevant time or in the amounts
necessary to meet the Group’s then existing capital expenditure requirements. If the Group were unable to
obtain financing for its future capital expenditures on commercially reasonable terms, this could limit the
Group’s ability to maintain its current operations in the longer term or expand in the future, which could
have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the expansion, development, renewal and maintenance of the Group’s infrastructure requires
significant maintenance capital expenditures, and are thus subject to risks and uncertainties which could
delay the introduction of services in some areas and increase the cost of infrastructure construction.
Ageing technology, and the need to maintain its functionality, may prove challenging, as the Group’s
ability to maintain a certain quality of service in connection with agreed-upon SLAs is critical to its ability
to retain its customers and contracts. If any of these risks transpire and the Group is unable to successfully
maintain its infrastructure, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

The Group is subject to a number of construction, financing, operating, regulatory and other risks, some of
which are beyond its control, including, but not limited to:

- shortages of materials, equipment and specialist labour required to maintain and develop its
infrastructure;

55


-----

- failure by sub-contractors to complete projects on time, on budget, or meet appropriate quality or
service delivery standards due to various factors, including any of the conditions described herein;

- labour disputes and disputes with sub-contractors, or litigation by sub-contractors resulting from any
of the risks herein described;

- inadequate infrastructure, including as a result of failure by third parties to fulfil their obligations
relating to the provision of utilities and transportation links that are necessary or desirable for the
successful operation of a project;

- failure to obtain local authority planning or landlord consent for site development, or subsequent
disputes with landlords;

- failure to renew land or rooftop leases or managed sites contracts;

- failure to renew street infrastructure concessions;

- changes in governmental priorities, spending programmes or procurement processes;

- failure to complete projects according to specifications;

- adverse weather conditions and natural disasters;

- accidents;

- unauthorised, rogue or other illicit use of spectrum or telecommunication capacity;

- failure to attract customers to products for which capital expenditure must be committed prior to
client contracting; and

- an inability to obtain and maintain project development permission or requisite regulatory licences,
permits or approvals.

The occurrence of one or more of the above-listed events may have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s ability to complete its current or future infrastructure or growth projects on schedule or within
budget, if at all, and may prevent the Group from achieving its project milestones or targets under its
SLAs.

In addition, the above risks may be more likely to occur if the Group is unable to identify and prevent risks
to its existing infrastructure before they occur. Specifically, if the data that the Group collects to identify
necessary infrastructure maintenance or expansion work, as well as assess the operational status of existing
equipment and machinery, is incomplete or inconsistent, the Group’s risk assessment as to the likelihood
of an equipment, machinery or infrastructure failure may be inaccurate. Equipment failure could lead to
service outages, affecting both customers and employees. For example, in January 2016, one of the Group’s
masts at its Start Point site was taken down due to a structural issue with the mast’s stay wires, resulting in
service disruption relating to that mast. Such incidents can be costly, and may also adversely impact
customer satisfaction and the Group’s reputation.

As at 30 June 2018, the Group had approximately 8,000 active licensed sites which comprise a mixture of
freehold, leasehold and managed sites. As at 30 June 2018, this site count included approximately 700 sites
with respect to which the Group has contractual options, pursuant to which it can seek to have sites
transferred to it. Such contractual options were obtained as part of a number of contracts with one of the
Group’s MNO customers. These contractual options permit the Group to complete the assignment of a
number of sites by 2018 and 2024. If the Group is unable to complete the assignment of such sites by the
relevant dates or at all, including as a result of failed negotiations with third-party landlords, this could
result in a lower number of sites available to the Group and the failure of the Group to realise its
anticipated growth potential, which could, in the longer term, have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s product offerings may fail to be competitive or accepted by customers_**

The Group faces the risk that its customers may not adopt the technologies it invests in, and customers
may fail to take up the products and services offered by the Group. For example, as communications
technology continues to develop in the longer term, competitors may be able to offer wireless
telecommunication infrastructure and services that are, or that are perceived to be, substantially similar or
better than those the Group offers, or offer technologies that provide similar functionality with competitive
prices and with comparable or superior quality. The Group cannot be certain that existing, proposed or as

56


-----

yet undeveloped technologies will not become dominant in the future and render the technologies and
infrastructure the Group uses today, or chooses to invest in for the future, less commercially valuable.

The Group has been involved in large-scale projects to roll out technology, such as for DAB and smart
metering. If the technology underpinning the Group’s large-scale projects is not accepted by customers or
is not commercially successful, the Group may be unable to realise the expected returns on its investments,
and may face reputational damage. For example, the Group has been implementing the DAB roll-out
programme for commercial DAB radio. However, a slowdown in the uptake of DAB services by
consumers, or a reduction in the overall radio market in favour of IP delivered music and radio content,
could impact the attractiveness of DAB to radio broadcasters. The Group has also been an early mover in
industries which are in the early stages of commercial development. If the technology is not successfully
developed or these industries do not mature, this may have a material adverse impact on the growth
potential of the Group’s future business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the
28GHz FWA trial or the Hammersmith & Fulham fibre trial may not result in the wider adoption of
5G FWA. As another example, the Group has relied on the Flexnet technology provided by Sensus UK
Systems Limited (Sensus) to develop a smart water meter connectivity product, which has been sold to
Thames Water and is being trialled by Anglian Water. If a solution other than Flexnet is more effective or
if competitors develop superior or cheaper products, the Group may be unable to win additional smart
water metering opportunities.

Further, if the Group is unable to effectively anticipate or react to technological developments, it could
lose customers, fail to attract new customers or incur substantial costs and investments in order to maintain
its competitive position, any of which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Group may fail to receive the necessary
licences or spectrum to provide services based on these new technologies or the Group may be negatively
impacted by unfavourable regulation regarding the usage of the solutions it proposes to offer, which could
in turn have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

New technological developments may make the Group’s existing services less desirable to its customers or
consumers, or require significant capital expenditures in order to upgrade and keep current. For example,
future development of IPTV, OTT or non-linear TV viewing, or internet radio could reduce demand for
DTT, DTH and/or DAB, which could in turn reduce demand for the Group’s DTT, DTH or DAB
infrastructure. Additionally, regulatory and competitive factors could require the Group to invest in new
technology generations of radio and DTT equipment to maintain the relevance of its platform beyond the
duration of existing contracts, which could impose significant costs on the Group.

If the Group is not successful in anticipating and responding to technological and competitive change and
resulting customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, it could have a material adverse
impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group may fail to carry out the successful delivery of its significant contracts or may have under-estimated the_**
**_costs required to do so_**

The Group believes a significant amount of its future revenue will derive from its contracts to carry out
major projects, such as its various smart metering projects, the 700 MHz clearance programme and
potential future DAB roll-out, all of which are long-term, high value projects and are subject to a variety of
risks, the results of which could cause a delay in project completion or increase costs. The Group may also
be exposed to regulatory sanctions if it experiences significant operational failures in any one of its projects
or business units, including a repeated or prolonged loss of transmission.

The Group has contracted with the major broadcasters and Ofcom for the delivery of the 700 MHz
clearance programme on a cost-plus basis. The Group is responsible for the spectrum planning, network
design, programme management, infrastructure changes, service continuity, structural work, asset
replacement and retuning of broadcast transmitters to enable DTT broadcasters to move into a lower
frequency band and clear this spectrum for mobile broadband use. Under its cost plus contract, the Group
is responsible for certain risks, some of which may be outside of the Group’s control, including suppliers
failing to deliver on time and at cost or union or workforce issues. In addition, the change in frequencies
may impact household aerials and their ability to receive DTT signals post-clearance which may result in
viewer complaints which may adversely impact the rate of roll-out of the programme and result in delays to
the overall programme. Should any of the foregoing occur, the Group could experience negative publicity
and lower levels of profitability as a result of cost or time overruns that the Group cannot charge on to

57


-----

Ofcom. In addition, the Group’s relationship with Ofcom, the Government or its key customers could be
damaged. Under the Group’s smart metering contract with the DCC, the Group may be unable to meet
certain critical service obligations within budget as the service increases in size, timely resolve defects or
other incidents in the production system or achieve network coverage commitments. If the Group is unable
to meet these critical service obligations or respond to change requests, the Group may be exposed to
contractual claims and damages, which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, revenue from major project contracts will depend on the Group’s ability to successfully deliver
the required services, which will depend on a variety of factors, including, among others, the Group’s
ability to recruit and maintain qualified engineering staff, the ability of the Group’s management to
provide sufficient oversight and the performance of the Group’s suppliers and contractors. In addition, the
ability of the Group to profitably execute its long-term contracts depends on its ability to accurately
estimate and successfully manage costs. For example, many of the Group’s long-term contracts have cost
indexes which are linked to the RPI or consumer price index (CPI) (in particular, those agreed with Ofcom
pursuant to the Reference Offer and for which contract prices were negotiated) and, as a result, the Group
is exposed to the risk that operating costs increase faster than the relevant cost index. If this occurs, the
Group may face difficulty or be contractually prevented from passing all of these increases on to its
customers, thereby diminishing the Group’s profitability. If the Group fails to perform under any of its
major contracts, or if costs increase more than expected, it could have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to risks associated with successful contract delivery, there is also a risk that, for certain of the
Group’s contracts, the services required to be delivered under such contracts will change as technological
specifications evolve. The changes in the services delivered under such contracts may be significant, and
the Group may be unable to deliver the additional services without incurring additional costs, which may
be significant and may not be capable of being fully passed on to customers. For example, in respect of the
smart metering communication network the Group has built as part of its contract with the DCC, the
Group has signed change request orders which set out the further charges to be paid to the Group in
relation to specification and timing modifications to the programme. However, the cost and services to be
provided under this contract may be subject to additional change requests for which the Group may not be
sufficiently compensated, which could lead to cost overruns and unforeseen complexities. These could
include uncertainties in the operational model for support and the responsibilities of suppliers, the
possibility of unforeseen licence and software costs, the potential for changing licence conditions, changes
in scope or policy leading to increased cost of delivery, and unforeseen service management requirements,
among others. Although the Group has in the past and will continue to rely upon contractual provisions, in
the DCC contract as well as other contractual arrangements, to protect itself from additional costs that
result from changes to the scope of contracted services, the scope of such services may change in such a
way that the Group is unable to deliver in a timely and cost effective manner.

**_The revenues contracted for in the Group’s orderbook may not be fully realised_**

The Group’s orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018 represents the Group’s estimate of the potential
future revenues to be derived from awarded contracts. The calculation of the Group’s orderbook is based
on a number of assumptions and estimates, including assumptions related to the performance of certain of
the Group’s existing contracts as at a particular date, contract duration and the pass through of certain
expenses, and certain inflation adjustments. While the Group’s orderbook is presented as at 30 June 2018,
by definition an orderbook does not provide a precise indication of the time period over which the Group
is entitled to receive such revenue and there is no assurance that such revenues will be actually received by
the Group in the time frame anticipated, or at all. The Group may fail to realise its entire orderbook in the
future due to cancellations. Material cancellations against the orderbook value for the years ended 30 June
2017 and 2018 consist of one termination in the Digital Platforms division but replaced by a reduced
service, resulting in a net impact of approximately £11.5 million and two terminations in the Telecoms &
M2M business unit amounting to £3.9 million. These material cancellation figures do not take into
consideration the impact of disposal of non-core business areas during this period. Although these
cancellations were not material for the Group as a whole, there can be no assurance that the group will not
experience significantly larger cancellations in the future. The realisation of the potential future revenues
in its orderbook, and the Group’s ability to expand or renew its orderbook in the future, will also be
affected by the Group’s performance under its existing contracts and its ability to meet its customers’
operational needs and expectations. If the Group fails to successfully provide its services, its ability to

58


-----

realise its orderbook could be adversely affected in the longer term, particularly with respect to its key
customers, which could materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

In addition, contracts for services are occasionally modified by mutual consent given that the Group
receives change of scope requests in the ordinary course of business from its customers given the long-term
nature of most of its contracts and the evolution of technological specifications, and the Group may be
unable to pass through any additional costs from such changes in scope to its customers. Changes in the
scope or schedule of the services the Group provides to its clients could adversely affect the Group’s
orderbook. Even where a project proceeds as scheduled, it is possible that the Group’s customers may fail
to pay amounts owed to the Group. Delays, renegotiations, payment defaults or project cancellations could
therefore significantly reduce the amount of orderbook currently estimated, and consequently, could
prevent the full amount of the Group’s orderbook from being realised as revenues, which would in turn
materially affect the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the
longer term.

**_The Group currently depends, and expects to continue to depend, upon a small number of customers for a_**
**_significant percentage of its revenue under long-term contracts_**

The Group’s two largest business units, Terrestrial Broadcast and Telecoms & M2M, derive a significant
proportion of their revenue from a limited number of large customer contracts, many of which are
long-term and have a high monetary value. The Group’s top three customers (BBC, CTIL and MBNL)
collectively represented approximately 34%, 38% and 39% of the Group’s revenue for the years ended
30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Contracts with the Group’s top three customers have historically
extended for long-term periods, and are currently due to expire in 2019, 2024 and 2030 for MBNL, CTIL
and the BBC (with regard to its DTT transmission contract), respectively. If any of these customers
terminate or otherwise fail to renew their contracts with the Group, either due to conditions that are within
the Group’s control (such as poor performance), or conditions that are outside of the Group’s control
(such as technological developments rendering its infrastructure asset base obsolete), this could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Conditions
which are within the Group’s control include unremedied poor performance by the Group, for example a
persistent failure to deliver DTT transmission service requirements under its contract with the BBC.
Conditions outside of the Group’s control include its infrastructure asset base becoming obsolete due to
technological developments in the longer term, for example if the BBC is no longer required to use the
DTT platform under the terms of its licence as a result of alternative platforms becoming more widely
adopted or coverage obligations being reduced, or MNOs no longer requiring use of the Group’s tower
infrastructure due to a change of technology or a change in their network share strategies or any similar
change, or other circumstances, including revisions to the BBC’s Royal Charter or due to insolvency of the
Group’s counterparties. MBNL and CTIL have no rights to terminate without cause but any of these
factors may affect their willingness to renew or the terms on which they would seek to renew. Broadcast
customers may terminate their contracts with the Group, for any of the reasons provided above, upon
providing notice to the Group, which notice periods may be, in some cases, immediately, and in other cases
up to 18 months, depending on the specific termination conditions of a given contract, and such
termination may give rise to early termination fees depending on the nature of the termination. In
addition, due to the nature of the Group’s infrastructure assets, the Group may be unable to secure
alternative customers on comparable terms to replace those customers, or at all, if its key customers
terminate or fail to renew their contracts.

Within the Digital Platforms division of the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit, the Group depends upon a
small number of high-value contracts with UK commercial broadcasters. Revenue from the top five Digital
Platforms customers represented 46% of the total revenue in the Digital Platforms division for the year
ended 30 June 2018. Contract lengths within the Digital Platforms division tend to be shorter duration
(typically three to six years) and hence require more frequent renegotiation, bringing associated pricing
risk. The Group has a number of contracts coming up for renewal in the coming few years in the ordinary
course of business, and the Group may not be able to renew such contracts on similar terms, or at all. The
Group is one of only two commercial DTT Multiplex operators in the UK and has historically experienced
low churn rates of approximately 2.5, 1.5 and 1.5 streams for the main Multiplexes (COM 5 and COM 6) in
the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, there can be no assurance that the
Group will be able to renew any contracts to provide its products or services to these customers on
commercially attractive terms, or at all, if the attractiveness of the DTT platform were to deteriorate in the
longer term. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to sell any additional future
capacity that becomes available on the Group’s Multiplexes or secure a commercially acceptable rate.

59


-----

Within the Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group’s revenues come largely from MNO customers and
M2M customers. Revenue from the four UK MNOs comprised approximately 70% of the Telecoms &
M2M business unit revenue whereas revenue from the DCC and Thames Water together represented 18%
of total revenue of the Telecoms & M2M business unit, in each case for the year ended 30 June 2018.
Because of concentration in the MNO market, the Telecoms division is heavily dependent on a small
number of high-value contracts that typically run seven to ten years from when they were first signed,
whereas the M2M contracts with the DCC and Smart Water can be up to 15 years from when they were
first signed. The Group’s significant Telecoms & M2M contracts include a contract with MBNL, the joint
venture (JV) between Three UK and EE (running until December 2019 which includes a sub-set of sites
the Group will manage until December 2024), an additional contract with EE (running until December
2018) and a contract with CTIL, the JV between Vodafone and O2 (running until July 2024). Together
these contracts represented a large majority of the Group’s site share revenue in the year ended 30 June
2018. The extension of the Group’s contract with EE, which is also due for renewal after 31 December
2018, is under discussion. The Group’s contract with MBNL contract has been extended for a further
12 months (to 31 December 2019) to allow time for renegotiation. As part of the MBNL contract
renegotiation, MBNL is running a competitive tendering process for 1,375 sites currently being provided by
the Group. There can be no guarantee that the Group will be able to renew the EE or MBNL contracts on
favourable terms, or at all, and a failure to renew such contracts could adversely impact the Group. Many
of the Group’s MNO customers have faced and may continue to face increased cost pressure as a result of
competition and economic conditions. Even if the volume of service demand from these customers does
not decrease, such pressures may impact the Group’s ability to provide services at existing prices, which
may result in lower profit margins. As a result of competitive pressures, MNOs may seek to cut costs or
pursue operational efficiencies through Radio Access Network (RAN) sharing, including through mast
sharing, antenna sharing and network roaming, which may adversely affect demand for and the prices the
Group is able to generate for leasing of space on its sites.

If any of the Group’s key customers experience a general decline in demand due to economic or other
forces or if any such customer is not satisfied with the services provided by the Group (resulting in a breach
of SLAs or other factors), such a key customer may reduce the number of service orders it has with the
Group, terminate its relationship with the Group (subject to certain early termination fees) or opt not to
renew its contractual relationship with the Group upon expiration. As a result of these or other factors, if
customers choose to cease using the Group’s services or reduce their usage, or if significant customers
negotiate lower price terms, it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is exposed to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of its key customers_**

Due to the significance of a small number of customers for the Group’s revenues and the long-term nature
of its customer contracts, the Group depends on its customers’ continued financial strength. Many of the
Group’s current and potential customers rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and
capital expenditures, and any significant downturn in the UK economy or disruption in the financial and
credit markets could periodically make it more difficult and more expensive for them to raise capital. If, as
a result of such an occurrence, the Group’s customers or potential customers reduce their level of business
activity, it could have a material adverse impact on demand for the Group’s services. Furthermore, as a
result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, one or more of the Group’s significant customers
could experience financial difficulties or enter administration, which could result in uncollectable accounts
receivable and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s results of operations. In the past, the Group
has had customers that have entered administration, although to date these administrations have not had a
material adverse impact on the Group’s business or revenues. The Group’s customers could also, if faced
with significant funding or credit problems, fail to maintain pace with the rate of technological change or
consumer preferences, or could lose licences critical to their businesses, in each case limiting their need for
or ability to purchase the Group’s services and materially harming the Group’s business and revenue. In
addition, these factors could result in the loss of all or a portion of the Group’s anticipated revenues from
certain significant customers, which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_If the Group is unable to provide uninterrupted or quality services, its reputation may be negatively affected, which_**
**_could expose the Group to penalties and loss of important contracts_**

The Group depends on the efficient, uninterrupted and high-quality operation of its infrastructure and
network systems. The Group’s service offerings are often complex, depend on the successful integration of
sophisticated in-house and third-party technology and services and must meet stringent quality
requirements. In particular, the Group could incur contractual penalties if the Group’s service is not in line
with agreed SLAs. For example, under the Undertakings, if terrestrial broadcast service levels are deemed
to be so poor, on a continuous basis, as to constitute a persistent failure, the Group would be required to
make repayment to the affected customer of up to 10% of payments received in any one year under the
affected contract or to provide equivalent service credits (which can be used to offset payment for services
provided by the Group), or in more limited instances, terminate their contracts or activate break clauses
that terminate the relationship prior to the completion of contracts. In addition to relying on the operation
of its network systems, the Group also provides installation and construction services for passive
equipment to key customers. If any of the Group’s services, including installation services, has reliability or
quality problems, its reputation could be damaged significantly and customers might be reluctant to
employ its services, which could result in a decline in revenues or the loss of existing customers.
Furthermore, should any of these requirements, the Undertakings, or SLAs be modified or updated in the
future, there is no guarantee the Group would be able to satisfy them.

The Group has built a smart metering communication network as part of its 15-year contract signed in
September 2013 with the DCC, a body licensed by statute and backed by the utility companies. The
Group’s smart metering communication network entered operational service throughout the UK following
the completion of integration testing in November 2016. This system is a complex network and
communications system. While it has undergone substantial testing by the Group and by the DCC, there
remains a risk that not all defects have been found and therefore a number of defects may exist and remain
in the production system. Any residual defects may require additional software development and lead to
service outages or other operational issues. In addition, the roll-out of the service to consumers’ homes
may be subject to delays, unforeseen technical or potential challenges, or cost overruns. The Group has
also contracted with Thames Water for the provision of smart metering fixed network infrastructure and
associated water meters that enable the collection, management and transfer of metering data from
households, which could also be subject to delays, cost overruns or adverse publicity. The successful
execution of these contracts requires an efficient operation by the Group.

Should significant service disruptions occur in respect of these or other key projects, the Group could be
subject to liability claims or litigation for damages related to such disruptions, including as a result of
delays in connection with smart metering contract roll-outs, and loss of contracts or failure to extend or
renew such contracts. If such litigation were to arise, regardless of its outcome, it could result in substantial
expenses to the Group, significantly divert the efforts of the Group’s technical and management personnel
and disrupt or otherwise severely impact its relationships with current and potential customers. In addition,
if any of the Group’s services has reliability or quality problems, its reputation could be damaged
significantly and customers might be reluctant to buy its services, which could result in a decline in
revenues, a loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers. As a result, a service
disruption or any reliability or quality issues and their consequences could have a material adverse impact
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group may not be able to effectively manage demand for its leased satellite transmission capacity_**

The Group relies upon third party satellite providers for the satellite capacity it sells to customers through
its Satellite & Media business unit. While the Group aims to secure flexible satellite capacity contracts, it
may be adversely affected if the amount of satellite capacity purchased by it does not align with capacity
demand from the Group’s customers. For example, if the Group has incorrectly assessed the demand for
satellite capacity, it may be unable to sell such excess capacity on commercially acceptable terms or at all.
Conversely, if the Group fails to ensure sufficient satellite capacity to meet the customer requirements, it
may be subject to breach of contract claims, loss of customer relationships and reputational damage. In
addition, if compression technology improves and becomes more prevalent, the Group’s customers may
not require as much capacity as anticipated, leading to a capacity surplus, and the Group may be unable to
find additional customers to purchase the remaining capacity. If there is a significant consumer move
towards IPTV or OTT, or the satellite TV platform operators change their distribution strategy from
satellite to IP, demand for the Group’s satellite capacity could be adversely affected. If the Group
purchases either excess or insufficient satellite capacity, the resulting disparity could have a material

61


-----

adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group needs to
periodically renew its existing leases with satellite providers and enter into additional leases for capacity in
order to provide continuity of service to its existing customers, enter into contracts with new customers and
expand its transmission service offerings. There can be no assurance, however, that the Group will be able
to maintain its capacity on acceptable terms as needed to provide services to its customers, which would in
turn materially affect the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The Group’s estimates, assumptions and judgments underlying its forward-looking performance measures,_**
**_including its Projected EBITDA, may prove inaccurate, and as a result the Group may be unable to successfully_**
**_meet its expectations or achieve desired financial results_**

Various estimates are presented in this Offering Memorandum relating to the Group’s forward-looking
performance measures. The information in respect of the Group’s forward-looking performance measures,
including its Projected EBITDA, represent the Group’s estimates only and should not be relied upon to
predict or forecast actual medium and longer term results or future events. Such estimates and beliefs
reflect a number of assumptions relating to future revenues, EBITDA, capital expenditures and working
capital, any of which may not be borne out due to both known and unforeseen risks, uncertainties and
other important factors beyond the control of the Group that could affect actual performance. Such
forecasts, assumptions, estimates and valuations carry an inherent degree of uncertainty and may not take
into account all relevant considerations. If the assumptions upon which the estimated data is based prove
to be inaccurate, this may indicate lower than expected growth rates or a less favourable position of the
Group in the market, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on the Group’s actual results of
operations and its business and financial condition in the medium and longer term.

**_The Group relies on third parties for key equipment, technology, site access and services, and the failure of third_**
**_parties to properly provide services, products or access could adversely affect the quality of the services the Group_**
**_offers_**

The Group depends upon third-party suppliers to provide key equipment, technology, services and access
to sites or other real estate leased by the Group for the provision of services, certain of which is only
available from a limited number of third parties. The Group does not have operational or financial control
over its third party suppliers. If these third parties fail to provide equipment, technology, services or access
to sites or other real estate leased by the Group for the provision of services on a timely basis, the Group
may be unable to provide services to its customers until an alternative source can be found, which may not
be available on favourable terms. This could result, for example, in programme slippage with direct service
providers or cause the Group to fail to successfully deliver under its contracts, causing failures to meet
SLAs, undertakings, reputational damage, damaging customer relationships, and an increased risk of
contractual damages or non-renewal of key contracts or licences.

For example, the Group relies on two critical suppliers for the provision of smart metering technology,
services and intellectual property. Sensus provides the radio system (Flexnet), the transceiver
communications equipment at each site, the network control software and for Thames Water meters radio
endpoints. EDMI provides the communications hub devices for each home for electricity & gas metering.
If either or both companies cease trading, the Group may be unable to find suitable replacement suppliers
on favourable terms or at all, and the Group may be unable to execute its smart metering contracts. The
Group’s smart energy metering contract is also dependent on the performance of the DCC and its other
suppliers (the most important being Telefonica and CGI). If the DCC, Telefonica and/or CGI materially
fail to meet their service obligations, the smart metering service may be disrupted or the entire programme
(including the portion delivered by the Group) may be cancelled or suspended while improvements are
implemented or replacements procured.

In addition, as certain of the markets in which the Group competes gain new entrants, it is possible that
new or existing competitors of the Group may compete for similar services from suppliers that the Group
uses, and may offer more favourable terms to particular suppliers than the Group. Additionally, it is
possible that current vendors of services could become competitors, therefore competing as consumers of
services they provide. Either of these occurrences could result in upward pricing pressure on these supply
arrangements, as a result of which the Group may be unable to renew its contracts at all or at the same rate
as in the past. If any of these contracts are terminated or the Group is unable to renew them on favourable
terms or negotiate agreements for replacement services with other providers at comparable rates, this
could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Additionally, a significant percentage of the Group’s wireless site portfolio in the Telecoms division for its
site share business is on leased land or other real estate such as rooftops, and any failure to gain access to
these sites could impair the Group’s operations. Even where the Group has long-term leases with renewal
rights, despite the form of security of tenure that can be provided by the Landlord & Tenant Act 1954 or
Code Powers, there can be no assurance that landlords may not seek to dispute the terms of a lease or seek
to terminate a lease before its term expires. Should such sites, including rooftop sites, cease to be available,
the Group may have difficulty securing cost efficient alternative transmission sites, or may not be able to
secure such alternative sites at all, which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s ability to operate its business effectively could be impaired if it fails to attract and retain high quality_**
**_personnel_**

The Group’s ability to operate its business and implement its strategies depends, in part, on the continued
contributions of its executive officers and other key employees. The loss of any of the Group’s key senior
executives could have an adverse effect on its business unless and until a suitable replacement is found.
There is a relatively small pool of executives in the market with the requisite experience and skills to serve
in the Group’s senior management positions, and the Group may be unable to identify or employ qualified
executives on acceptable terms.

In addition, the Group believes that its future success will depend on its continued ability to attract and
retain highly skilled personnel with experience in its key business areas. These key employees have
knowledge and skills that are critical to the Group’s business, such as knowledge of key customer contracts,
experience and engineering skills and know-how with the technologies that the Group uses, as well as
familiarity with the Group’s financial and contractual arrangements, and the Group is reliant on the
retention or successful succession of such employees. Should the Group not be able to retain such
employees or ensure a successful transfer of know-how to new employees, customer relationships or
programme delivery may be damaged due to the loss of people with critical knowledge or skills.
Competition for personnel with the requisite skill level and background is intense and the Group may not
be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel with these or other key skills. Should it
fail to do so, or were the Group to lose certain of its key personnel, its business and growth prospects may
be harmed and it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

**_The Group may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labour matters_**

As of 30 June 2018, approximately 36% of the Group’s employees were covered by collective bargaining
agreements, including through the Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union
(BECTU), the UK’s media and entertainment trade union. Unionisation through BECTU requires
consultation with BECTU for certain key labour-related business and administrative decisions, including
restructuring. While the Group strives to maintain good relationships with its employees and their unions
and has not had any work stoppages in many years, there can be no assurance that such relationships will
continue to be cooperative or that it will not be affected by strikes or other types of conflict with labour
unions and employees. The Group may not be able to renew its collective bargaining agreements on
satisfactory terms or at all. This could result in strikes or work stoppages, which could impair the Group’s
ability to deliver the services it provides and result in a substantial loss of revenue. The terms of existing or
renewed collective bargaining agreements could also significantly increase the Group’s costs or negatively
affect the Group’s ability to increase operational efficiency.

In addition, many of the Group’s customers and suppliers also have unionised workforces. Work stoppages
or slowdowns experienced by the Group’s customers could result in lower demand for its services and
products. In the event that either the Group or one or more of its customers or suppliers experience a work
stoppage, such work stoppage could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s infrastructure assets may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events or damage_**

The Group’s sites, satellite uplink stations and other facilities are subject to risks associated with natural
disasters and other catastrophic events, such as ice and wind storms, tornadoes, floods, fires, hurricanes,
earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, network software flaws and acts of vandalism, arson,
terrorism, or war, theft and fuel shortages as well as other unforeseen events or damage. Any damage or

63


-----

destruction to the Group’s sites or other facilities, including major office or administrative facilities, as a
result of these or other events would impact its ability to provide services to its customers. In the Terrestrial
Broadcast business unit, the Group’s DTT and radio masts, towers and other equipment may be affected
by natural disasters and other catastrophic events. If the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast infrastructure is
damaged, any disruption or reliability or quality issues could have a material adverse impact on the
Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In the Telecoms & M2M business unit, the
Group’s sites may be damaged as a result of natural disasters or other unforeseen events, which could lead
to service disruption or an inability to deliver on the Group’s contracts. For example, if the Group’s towers
fall or collapse, or if the Group’s smart metering data centres are significantly damaged, the Group may be
unable to provide services to its customers and may suffer reputational damage. In the Satellite & Media
business unit, the satellites on which the Group relies may be damaged by unforeseen events or otherwise
fail, which could lead to a disruption in services and the subsequent loss of reputation, customers or profits.
Because the majority of the Group’s satellite contracts are on a non-restorable basis, the Group does not
have any rights to consequential damages if a satellite is damaged by an unforeseen event. Further, the
Group’s playout centre does not have a back-up site.

While the Group believes it maintains adequate insurance coverage for natural disasters and other
catastrophic events and the Group has in place disaster recovery plans, it may not have adequate insurance
to cover all of the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event. Further, the Group
carries business interruption insurance that may cover the increased cost of operational service but would
not cover lost revenues. If the Group is unable to provide services to its customers as a result of damage to
its sites, it could lead to customer loss. Additionally, if the loss of service is not deemed due to an
unforeseeable force majeure event, the Group could be held responsible for failing to satisfy service
obligations under its transmission contracts, which could result in service credit penalties or suspension of
normal fees and annual charges. As a result of such an impact on the Group’s ability to provide services or
customers’ continued use of such services, a natural disaster or other unforeseen events could result in a
material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to UK and global economic conditions_**

Negative developments in the macro-economic environment in which the Group operates could adversely
impact the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s performance
depends to a certain extent on a number of macro-economic factors outside its control which impact
consumer and commercial spending, including political, financial and economic conditions, particularly in
the UK. Factors which impact consumers’ disposable income include, among other things, UK gross
domestic product growth, unemployment rates, consumer and business confidence, the availability and cost
of credit, interest rates, taxation, regulatory changes, oil and utility prices and security concerns. Each of
these factors could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In particular, Brexit has caused political and economic uncertainty regarding the future of the UK in
domestic and international markets, a depreciation of the pound compared to other currencies,
particularly the US dollar and the Euro, and has adversely impacted current trading in the UK, which
could have a material effect on the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition. There is
uncertainty as to how long it will take to negotiate the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, which EU laws and
regulations may continue to apply in the UK, and what changes there may be to the application of these
laws and regulations. These developments, and the uncertainty surrounding them, have had and may
continue to have a material adverse impact on economic conditions in the UK and the stability of UK
financial markets. A general slow-down in the UK economy due to Brexit, or for other reasons, may
negatively impact the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The potential effects of a possible second referendum on Scottish independence could also have a
materially adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. As the
Group is the exclusive provider of electricity and gas smart meters in the north of England and Scotland,
any change in the political structure of the UK or Scotland could have a substantial regulatory effect.
Currently, the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and Ofgem are the national regulators of
water smart metering and gas and electricity smart metering, respectively. If Scotland becomes
independent from the UK, the Group would potentially be regulated by new Scottish national entities, if it
were to continue its operations in Scotland. Further, the Group could face additional tax burdens or
restrictions based on competition laws or regulations. There is still uncertainty as to whether a second

64


-----

independence referendum will be held, with the Scottish government last announcing in June 2017 that it
would postpone legislation pertaining to the proposed second referendum until at least autumn 2018.

Any significant slowdown in the UK economy could lead to deterioration in consumer confidence and
commercial spending, which could reduce the level of demand for the Group’s services. In particular, there
can be no assurance as to levels of future UK economic growth, which is an important factor affecting the
demand for certain of the Group’s services. For example, the growth of the telecommunications industry
and demand for digital broadcast media and advertised products and services are tied to UK consumer
discretionary spending. Mobile devices, telecom services, television, other products and services, and
products and services advertised over these media may be viewed by consumers as conveniences rather
than necessities. During times of economic uncertainty, consumers are more likely to curtail such
purchases and expenses. Further, a downturn in the UK economy could reduce commercial spending,
which could significantly impact the Group’s DTT and DTH customers, where a significant percentage of
revenue comes from TV advertising spend, and thereby impact the DTT and DTH customers’ demand for
the Group’s broadcast capacity. As a result, the Group’s business may be sensitive to changes in general
economic conditions that impact discretionary consumer spending.

In addition, due to the current economic environment in the UK, there is a risk that third parties may face
financial difficulties or become insolvent. The Group’s significant customers or other counterparties could
face limitations on access to credit, or be able to access credit only on unfavourable terms, which could
curtail their expansion or growth plans and have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is subject to stringent regulation relating to environmental protection and health, and if the Group is_**
**_found to have not been in compliance with any portion of such applicable rules, the Group could be exposed to fines,_**
**_increased costs, or sanctions, or could be liable for damages to third parties_**

The Group is subject to comprehensive regulation in the UK and at the EU level aimed at the protection
of the environment and health. In certain cases, the construction of passive infrastructures may affect the
landscape and the surrounding natural habitat, thereby causing changes to the relevant flora and fauna. In
addition, the Group may face liability related to the presence of lead paint on structures, which may affect
its older sites and larger structures. Inhalation of lead paint particles may produce health problems, such as
lead poisoning, in workers or people in the vicinity of these structures. There is a risk that the actual or
perceived health risk associated with structures containing lead paint could lead to litigation or hinder
operation of existing infrastructure. In addition, the Group may face risks associated with the aboveground
bulk storage of fuel for back-up diesel generators, which are present at many of its sites. Leaks or spills
may cause soil or groundwater contamination, and sites may have areas of ground contamination due to
historical use. Additionally, there is risk of asbestos exposure, as asbestos could be present in buildings
constructed before 1990. There are approximately 6,000 sites where the Group has the ‘‘Duty Holder’’
liability under the Control of Asbestos Regulations. The Group discharges its duties under these
Regulations by identifying the asbestos, maintaining information on the location and type of asbestos,
monitoring the condition of the asbestos sites, and removing the asbestos where practical when building
maintenance or refurbishment is undertaken. The potential total cost of remediation of contaminated sites
is expected to be less than £1 million in aggregate. The Group may also face risks associated with working
at height and with perceived or actual harm caused by electro-magnetic radiation.

While the Group intends to comply with applicable environmental legislation and regulatory requirements
and believes that it is materially in compliance with these as at the date of this Prospectus, it is possible that
such compliance may prove to be costly, or that the Group may fail to fully comply with applicable
regulations. In addition to potential liability for environmental clean-up, the Group may become subject to
monetary fines and penalties for violation of applicable environmental laws, regulations or administrative
orders. This may also result in closure or temporary suspension at certain sites or adverse restrictions on
the Group’s operations. The Group may also, in the future, become involved in proceedings with various
environmental authorities that may require it to pay fines, comply with more rigorous standards or other
requirements or incur capital and operating expenses for environmental compliance. In addition, third
parties may sue the Group for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating
from its properties, or for damages arising while on the Group’s properties.

In addition, the legislation currently in force in the UK and in particular the technical instructions that
directly and/or indirectly apply to the Group’s activities, are based, inter alia, on currently available
scientific knowledge regarding the effects of exposure to electrical, magnetic and electromagnetic fields

65


-----

(EMF). Public perception of possible health risks associated with telecommunications technology could
slow the growth of wireless companies, which could in turn slow the Group’s growth. In particular, negative
public perception of, and regulations regarding, these perceived health risks could slow the market
acceptance of telecommunication services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of
sites. If the current regulatory framework is amended, it is possible that all the technical requirements
applicable to the Group’s activities will require an infrastructure upgrade in order to continue to operate in
compliance with the applicable laws and regulations, thereby causing substantial and unexpected costs.

In addition, the potential connection between electromagnetic radiation and certain negative health effects
has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years, and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers in several
countries. If a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that electromagnetic radiation poses
health risks to consumers, it could negatively impact the market for wireless services, as well as the Group’s
customers, and it could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations. The Group’s insurance with respect to the potential harm from electromagnetic
radiation may not be sufficient to cover all or a substantial portion of its liability.

If the Group was to have not been in compliance with any portion of such applicable rules, the Group
could be exposed to fines, be forced to face costs, and/or be liable for damages to third parties, all of which
could be substantial. In addition, the Group could be found liable for damages related to alleged negative
health effects arising out of exposure to EMF, which may occur regardless of compliance with the emission
levels permitted by the then-applicable laws. Moreover, the Group could be subject to sanctions such as
restrictions on its activities, the temporary shutdown of certain infrastructure sites or facilities, the
obligation to move sites to other locations or various other restrictions on the Group’s operations as a
result of such non-compliance.

In certain areas, local associations or groups may oppose the construction or operation of the Group’s
infrastructure as a result of alleged negative effects on the relevant area and the landscape. Any such
challenge filed with the competent authorities may prevent or delay the Group’s development projects.

The occurrence of any of the events described above could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s
business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

**_The Group must comply with data protection regulations_**

The Group is subject to regulation regarding the use of personal data. The Group processes personal,
customer, employee and other data as part of its business and therefore must comply with strict data
protection and privacy laws. The Group seeks to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance
with the relevant data protection regulations by its employees and any third party service providers, and
also implements security measures to help prevent cyber-theft. Notwithstanding such efforts, the Group is
exposed to the risk that this data could be wrongfully appropriated, lost or disclosed, stolen or processed in
breach of data protection laws.

If the Group or any of the third party service providers on which it relies fail to store or transmit customer
information in a secure manner, or if any loss or wrongful processing of personal customer data were
otherwise to occur, the Group could be subject to investigative and enforcement action by relevant
regulatory authorities, could be subject to claims or complaints from the person to whom the data relates,
or could face liability under data protection laws. Any of these events could also result in reputational
damage, which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In 2012 the European Commission published a proposal for a new General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR), which would replace the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (and the equivalent laws in other EU and
EEA Member States) with an EU regulation having direct effect in the UK and all other EU and EEA
Member States. The European Commission, European Parliament and the Council of Ministers agreed
the GDPR on 15 December 2015, and the GDPR has applied from 25 May 2018. The GDPR has recently
been transposed into UK law, by way of the new Data Protection Act 2018. The GDPR has increased
compliance requirements and includes significant financial penalties of up to 4% of the annual worldwide
turnover of company groups. Firms have two years from the adoption of the GDPR to implement all the
necessary changes to their systems and operations in order to meet the new compliance requirements. The
GDPR has increased the regulatory burden on the Group in processing personal, customer, employee and
other data in the conduct of its business and while the Group has established procedures to ensure

66


-----

compliance with these regulations, breach of the GDPR may expose the Group to penalties. The Group
has established a GDPR steering committee to oversee and monitor implementation of the new data
protection rules and steps have been taken to promote awareness and understanding of this regime within
the Group. Nevertheless, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be fully compliant with its obligations
under the GDPR, and therefore the Group may be subject to regulatory action or financial penalties,
which could also result in adverse publicity or reputational damage.

**_The Group must comply with anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and sanctions regulations_**

The Group is subject to various legal and regulatory requirements and risks in the countries in which it has
facilities or operations, involving compliance with antitrust, anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and
anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery
Act 2010 and sanctions imposed by international organisations or individual nations. Where applicable,
these laws restrict or prohibit transactions with certain countries and with certain companies and
individuals identified on lists maintained by the US government, the EU, various EU Member States and
other governments.

Additionally, a set of sanctions was imposed on Qatar by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Egypt followed by several other Arab states in June 2017. In particular, these countries have
demanded that Qatar shut down the Al Jazeera network, one of the Group’s customers in its Satellite
business. These sanctions could negatively impact Al Jazeera, or result in its shutdown, which could in turn
negatively impact the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Although the Group believes that its current policies and procedures are sufficient to comply with
applicable anti-money laundering, anti-bribery and sanctions rules and regulations, it cannot guarantee
that such policies completely prevent situations of money laundering or bribery, including actions by the
Group’s employees, for which the Group might be held responsible. Any of such events may have severe
consequences, including sanctions, fines and reputational consequences, which could have a material
adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group may be unable to deliver on its cost savings programme or achieve the expected efficiencies_**

The Group continues to implement a cost savings programme aimed at achieving efficiencies and reducing
costs by optimising the Group’s cost base and driving margin improvements. Although significant cost
savings and margin improvements have been achieved since 2014 by reducing overhead and consolidating
business units into a more efficient structure, among other initiatives, and management expects to continue
to reduce costs improve margins in the future, any such initiatives may fail to deliver the intended savings
or margin improvements going forward. In addition, in the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group launched a
company-wide transformation programme called ‘‘FutureFit’’, aiming to streamline processes, modernise
IT systems and achieve cost efficiencies. The efficiencies and other financial benefits expected from this
programme rely on certain assumptions which could prove incorrect. There can be no guarantee that the
Group will achieve its cost savings or margin improvement targets, and the Group’s failure to do so could
in turn materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_If telecommunication service providers consolidate or merge with each other to any significant degree, the Group’s_**
**_growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be adversely affected_**

Consolidation of the UK wireless telecommunication industry could result in fewer wireless
telecommunication networks, less infrastructure as operators seek to share the infrastructure they use and
reduced capital expenditures due to the overlap in network coverage and in expansion plans. In case of any
sharing or consolidation, certain parts of the Group’s actual or potential customers’ merged networks may
be deemed to be duplicative by its customers and these customers may attempt to eliminate these
duplications. The Group’s future results of operations could be negatively impacted if a significant number
of sites the Group provides are deemed duplicative and are eliminated from its ongoing contractual
revenues and its growth prospects may be limited if such consolidations occur and eliminate what the
Group currently believes to be potential markets for its services. Similar consequences might occur if
telecommunication service providers seek to engage in extensive sharing, roaming or resale arrangements
and thus provide their own sites to other operators as an alternative to licensing infrastructure from thirdparty operators such as the Group. Should MNO consolidation occur, it could result in overlapping site
coverage, and the subsequent decommissioning of sites which have become redundant, including sites
currently licensed from the Group. There can be no assurance that there will be no consolidation of UK

67


-----

wireless telecommunication operators in the future, which could decrease the Group’s revenue or profit
margin from key customers, could affect the timing of contract renewal discussions and could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Various factors outside of the Group’s control, such as inclement weather or an outbreak of contagious disease, may_**
**_negatively impact employee productivity or restrict the Group’s ability to access its sites for critical maintenance or_**
**_other purposes_**

Various incidents beyond the Group’s control, such as infectious diseases and subsequent governmentimposed travel restrictions or inclement weather, may negatively impact employee productivity or restrict
the ability of the Group’s employees to reach critical sites or offices. For example, outbreaks of contagious
diseases could adversely affect the UK economy and could lead to measures, including governmentenforced quarantines or travel limitations that could restrict the Group’s access to its infrastructure sites,
which could impact the Group’s ability to adequately maintain its operations. In addition, inclement
weather, such as heavy snowfall, may obstruct access to sites. Such occurrences could also prevent access to
the Group’s offices or other critical facilities. If the Group cannot access its sites or other facilities,
performance of maintenance or other essential business tasks could be impaired, which could have a
material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group is exposed to risks in connection with funding of its pension commitments_**

The Group has defined benefit obligations in the UK pursuant to the Group’s previous defined benefits
plan, which is now closed to future accrual from 31 January 2016. Although the Group switched to a
defined contribution arrangement (whereby the Group provides benefits to current employees through a
defined contribution, shifting the investment risk on the employees with limited financial risks on the
Group), the Group still has obligations under the previous plan. The Group’s net pension obligations
(consisting of pension obligations less pension plan assets and net of deferred tax), according to the latest
triennial actuarial valuation for 30 June 2018, amounted to a net deficit of £18.3 million.

The Group’s externally invested pension plan assets are invested via externally managed funds and
insurance companies. Trustees of the trust fund, in consultation with the Group, generally prescribe the
investment strategies applied by these funds, and thus the Group does not determine their individual
investment allocations. The assets may be invested in different asset classes including equity, fixed-income
securities, real estate and other investment vehicles. The values attributable to the externally invested
pension plan assets are subject to fluctuations in the capital markets that are beyond the Group’s influence.
Unfavourable developments in the capital markets could result in a substantial coverage shortfall for these
pension obligations, resulting in a significant increase in the Group’s net pension obligations. In addition,
deterioration in the Group’s financial condition could lead to an increased funding commitment to the
trustee, which could further exacerbate any financial difficulties the Group could face at such time. Any
such increases in its net pension obligations could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition due to
an increased additional outflow of funds to finance the pension obligations. Also, the Group is exposed to
risks associated with longevity and interest rate and inflation rate changes in connection with its pension
commitments as an interest rate decrease or increase in longevity could have an adverse effect on its
liabilities under these pension schemes. Furthermore, a strengthening of the regulatory funding regime
could increase requirements for cash funding, demanding more financial resources to meet governmentally
mandated pension requirements. The realisation of any of these risks could require the Group to make
significant additional payments to meet its pension commitments, which could have a material adverse
impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Group’s potential liability for distributing content broadcast by its customers over its network is uncertain. As a_**
**_carrier of broadcast content, the Group could become liable for such content based on obscenity, defamation,_**
**_negligence, copyright infringement, trademark infringement or other grounds_**

The Group’s standard position reflected in contractual documentation provides that its customers are fully
responsible for the content of their programming, for ensuring that the content conforms to all applicable
governmental regulations and for obtaining any local regulatory approvals relating to their broadcasts. This
documentation further provides that the Group is not liable if the satellite fleet operator requires it to
suspend or terminate service for any reason relating to content. The Group’s customers are generally
required to indemnify it for any financial costs of governmental or third-party proceedings resulting from
their content. Although the Group attempts to reduce its liability through contractual indemnification
from its customers and disclaimers, there is no guarantee that the Group would be successful in protecting

68


-----

itself against this type of liability. Even if the Group were ultimately successful in such litigation, litigation
would divert management time and resources, could be costly and is likely to generate negative publicity
for the Group’s business. The Group may also be forced to implement expensive measures to alter the way
its services are provided to avoid any further liability, which in turn could have a material adverse impact
on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Regulatory prohibition or limitation of the disposal of certain of the Group’s central assets may reduce the value_**
**_received or available for debtholders in a enforcement situation_**

The Group’s ability to transfer or dispose of certain key assets is prevented or limited by regulation.
Certain of the Group’s terrestrial broadcast assets are subject to the Undertakings, which, among other
requirements, prohibit the Group from transferring these assets or control over them outside of the Group
without the prior written consent of the Office of Fair Trading. In addition, Ofcom’s consent is required to
transfer the Group’s DTT and DAB Multiplex licences and Ofcom has the discretion to revoke these
licences should there be a change of control of the licensor and Ofcom would not have granted the licence
in the new circumstances. Because of these restrictions on its ability to transfer these assets, the Group may
not be able to sell or otherwise dispose of them. Subsequently, the Group’s ability to obtain full value, or
any value at all, for these assets could be limited should the Group enter administration or otherwise be
forced to liquidate its assets.

**FINANCING RISKS**

**_The Group’s hedging programme may not adequately mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates or_**
**_inflation_**

While the Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower operate a hedging programme in accordance with the
hedging policy of the Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower, the Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower
are not required to fully or perfectly hedge their present or future interest rate or inflation exposure and
may not in practice do so. The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer are subject to the creditworthiness
of, and in certain circumstances early termination of the hedging arrangements with, either the Borrower
Hedge Counterparties or the Issuer Hedge Counterparties (as defined in the Common Terms Agreement),
respectively. Neither the Senior Issuer or the Senior Borrower nor any Issuer Hedge Counterparty or
Borrower Hedge Counterparty shall have any obligation to take any action (or to cease to take any action)
if any such Issuer Hedge Counterparty or Borrower Hedge Counterparty (as applicable) subsequently
ceases to satisfy the Minimum Rating Agency Requirements (as defined in the Common Terms
Agreement) which applied on the date of entry into the relevant Senior Issuer Hedge or Senior Borrower
Hedge (as applicable).

**_The Group’s significant debt obligations could limit its flexibility in operating its business and expose it to additional_**
**_risks_**

The Group is highly leveraged and has significant debt service obligations. As of 30 June 2018, the Group’s
aggregate net senior and junior borrowings were £2,892.0 million and, after giving pro forma effect to the
offering of the Notes hereby and the use of proceeds, the Group’s net senior and junior borrowings would
have been £2,942.8 million. In addition, the Group may incur further indebtedness under the Senior
Transaction Documents.

The Group’s ability to make scheduled payments on time and to refinance its debt and to fund future
operations and capital expenditures will depend on the Group’s future operating performance and ability
to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive,
market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond the Group’s control, as well as
the other factors discussed in this ‘‘Risk Factors’’ section and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The
Group cannot assure investors that its business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated cost savings, revenue and earnings growth and operating improvements will be
realised or that future debt and equity financing will be available to the Group in an amount sufficient to
enable it to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Group’s indebtedness, including the
Notes and the Senior Notes, and the Group’s other indebtedness and hedging or to fund its other liquidity
needs. The Group’s continued access to debt financing as a source of funding for its operations and for
refinancing maturing debt is subject to many factors, many of which are outside the Group’s control. For
example, interest rate fluctuations, an economic downturn, social unrest or changes in the UK regulatory
environment or broadcasting and telecommunications industry structure (such as technological change or

69


-----

reduction in spectrum available) which weaken the strength of the Group’s competitive position or
prospects could increase the Group’s cost of borrowing or restrict the Group’s ability to obtain debt
financing. In addition, disruptions in global capital and credit markets, such as the ones that began in the
second half of 2008 as a result of uncertainty or failures of significant financial institutions or the ones that
followed the Brexit referendum, could adversely affect the Group’s access to financing. The Group cannot
guarantee that it will be able to arrange financing on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability of the Group
to obtain financing from banks and other financial institutions or from capital markets would have a
material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Group’s high degree of leverage may have important consequences for investors in the Notes. For
example, it could:

- require the Group to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to required
payments on indebtedness under the Senior Transaction Documents and the Transaction Documents,
thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other
general corporate activities;

- subject to the covenants under the Common Terms Agreement, restrict the Group’s ability to make
certain strategic acquisitions, exploit new business opportunities or dispose of certain assets;

- subject to the covenants under the Common Terms Agreement, restrict its ability to obtain additional
financing, or draw on existing facilities, for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
corporate activities;

- subject to the covenants under the Common Terms Agreement relating to the Group’s debt, limit its
flexibility in planning for, or reacting in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the
industry in which it operates;

- require the Group, subject to the covenants under the Common Terms Agreement, to sell or
otherwise transfer assets used in its business in order to fund its debt service obligations;

- increase the Group’s cost of borrowing;

- make the Group more vulnerable than its competitors to the impact of economic downturns and
adverse developments in its business; and

- place the Group at a competitive disadvantage against any less leveraged competitors, including
forcing the Group to forego certain business opportunities.

Moreover, if the Group’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to
pay its obligations as they mature, to fund its liquidity needs or enable the Group to meet its financial
covenants, the Group may be forced to:

- reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of its debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

The Group cannot guarantee that it would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis
or on satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on the Group’s
outstanding indebtedness or meet financial covenants under the Liquidity Facility Agreement on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of the credit rating of the Notes, which could also harm the Group’s
ability to incur additional indebtedness or refinance existing debt. In addition, any refinancing of the
Group’s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Group to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict the Group’s business operations. There can be no assurances that
any assets which the Group could be required to dispose of can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such
sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale will be acceptable.

The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The Obligors may incur additional indebtedness, including incorporating or acquiring subsidiaries and incurring_**
**_debt at such subsidiaries, which could increase their risk exposure from debt and could decrease the Noteholders’_**
**_share in any proceeds._**

Subject to restrictions in the Conditions and the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Obligors may incur
additional indebtedness, which could increase the risks associated with the Group’s already substantial
indebtedness. The Obligors have the ability to borrow up to £20 million of committed financing under the
Liquidity Facility, and any such borrowings will be senior secured indebtedness, and will receive proceeds
from an enforcement action on the Collateral prior to the Notes.

The Obligors may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including under the fixed charge
coverage ratio under the Notes. The Obligors may also secure such indebtedness so long as the Group’s
net senior secured leverage ratio is no more than 6.5 to 1.0. The Obligors may incorporate or acquire
subsidiaries in the future and such subsidiaries may also be able to incur indebtedness, further increasing
the risks associated with the Group’s substantial leverage. Any indebtedness that is incurred at such
subsidiary level would be structurally senior to the Notes, as such subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes.
Additionally, the Obligors could raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the
Notes. Although the Conditions and Liquidity Facility Agreement will contain restrictions governing the
incurrence of additional indebtedness, the restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and
exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Conditions and the Liquidity
Facility Agreement will not prevent the Obligors from incurring obligations that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements.

**_The Group will need to refinance some of its debt as it matures and may need additional financing to cover capital_**
**_expenditure and certain other expenses. The Group can provide no assurance that such financing will be readily_**
**_available or on attractive or historically comparable terms or that the cost of such financing will not have a material_**
**_adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations_**

The Group will need to raise further debt from time to time in order, among other things, to:

(a) finance future capital expenditure; and

(b) enable it to refinance existing senior debt, junior debt and other debt.

See ‘‘—Business and Industry Risks—The Group is exposed to certain risks in respect of the development,
_expansion and maintenance of its broadcast and wireless telecommunications infrastructure, including the need_
_for on-going capital expenditure, which could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial_
_condition and results of operations’’._

There can be no assurance that the Group will be able to raise future finance on terms that are
economically viable or at all.

**_The Group’s hedging contracts expose the Group to contingent liabilities that are volatile and may crystallise into_**
**_cash obligations in the future_**

The Group holds interest rate swaps (with an aggregate notional amount of £1.5 billion as at 30 June
2018), inflation-linked swaps (with an aggregate notional amount of £1.3 billion as at 30 June 2018) and
cross-currency swaps (with an aggregate GBP equivalent notional amount of £0.2 billion as at 30 June
2018) to hedge its interest rate, inflation rate and/or foreign exchange exposure. The Group maintains a
hedging policy to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and to ensure the certainty of future
interest (and, in the case of non-sterling denominated debt, principal) cash flows in order to service and
repay its debt. This involves entering into derivative contracts that may require the Group to fund cash
payments in connection with the early termination of any such contracts. Such early termination payments
are principally likely to arise if the Senior Borrower or the Senior Issuer (as applicable) fails to make
timely payments of amounts due under the relevant swap(s), upon the insolvency of a member of the
Group or acceleration of the WBS obligations, or the debt to which such swap relates is prepaid, repaid or
redeemed early, or the hedge counterparty defaults in respect of its obligations under the relevant swap,
or, in respect of £0.2 billion notional amount of the inflation-linked swaps, on the mandatory break date
falling in 2023, and so are contingent in nature. The extent of these liabilities depends on financial market
conditions and expectations of future rate movements at the time of early termination that are beyond the
Group’s control (i.e. the fair value of the relevant swap(s) at the time of determination). The Group has
disclosed in its financial results for the period ending 30 June 2018, a fair value of £1.0 billion for the

71


-----

Group’s IRS, ILS and cross currency swaps (as shown in Note 25 of the Group’s consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 2018 included in this Offering Memorandum). This comprised
£297.7 million for the IRS and £755.1 million for the ILS. As at 30 June 2018, the present value of adding
one basis point (PV01) to the rate payable was estimated by the Group to be £1.8 million for ILS and
£0.6 million for IRS. The PV01 represents the present value of adding one basis point to the fixed rate
payable by the Senior Borrower, and is a function of interest rates and time (which means that the PV01
will vary from time to time). The Group’s ability to fund these contingent liabilities will depend on the
liquidity of the Group’s assets and access to capital at the time, and the need to fund these contingent
liabilities could adversely impact the Group’s financial condition. For further details see ‘‘Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off Balance Sheet Arrangements’’._

**_Although the Issuer may have funds available to it under the Liquidity Facility, it may not be sufficient or it may be_**
**_unavailable to cover shortfalls in the Obligors’ ability to make payments under the Notes_**

Pursuant to the terms of the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Issuer will make and apply the drawings
under the Liquidity Facility Agreement in order to service interest payable in respect of the Notes and
repay loans which are required to be repaid under the Liquidity Facility, as more fully described in the
section ‘‘Summary of the Transaction Documents—Liquidity Facility Agreement’’. However, there is no
assurance that any such shortfalls will be met in whole or in part by amounts available under the Liquidity
Facility Agreement. In addition, the Issuer is exposed to the risk of a Liquidity Facility Provider becoming
insolvent. In such circumstances, insufficient funds may be available to the Issuer to pay in full interest due
on the Notes.

**_Modifications, waivers and consents in respect of the enforcement of the Transaction Security may be made without_**
**_the knowledge or consent of individual Noteholders_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Trustee shall seek the approval of the Noteholders
and the other relevant Secured Creditors on certain matters, as a condition to concurring in making
modifications to or granting consents or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Transaction
Security or to the enforcement of the Transaction Security. It is possible that the interests of the other
Secured Creditors will not be aligned with the interests of the Noteholders and therefore there can be no
assurance that any such modification, consent or waiver or enforcement action taken will be favourable to
all Noteholders. In the case of modifications, consents or waivers, such changes may be detrimental to the
interests of some or all Noteholders, despite the ratings of such Notes being affirmed. Therefore,
Noteholders alone may not be able to control the outcome of any particular approval or enforcement
process and it is possible that the Security Trustee may be given an instruction which is not in the interests
of Noteholders.

The Note Trust Deed and the Conditions contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to
consider matters affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all
Noteholders, including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders
who voted in a manner contrary to the majority.

The Note Trust Deed and the Conditions also provide that, subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Note Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders, agree to (i) any modification of, or
to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the provisions of Notes or
(ii) determine without the consent of the Noteholders that an Event of Default shall not be treated as such
or (iii) the substitution of another company as principal debtor under any Notes in place of the Issuer, in
the circumstances described in Condition 9 (Events of Default).

**LEGAL RISKS**

**_A change in English law may adversely affect Noteholders_**

The conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Offering
Memorandum. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to
English law or administrative practice after the date of this Offering Memorandum. It is possible that
changes in law or regulations, or their interpretation or application, after the date of this Offering
Memorandum may result in the transaction as originally structured no longer having the effect anticipated.

-----

**_The validity of subordination provisions under English law is uncertain_**

There is uncertainty as to the validity and/or enforceability of a provision which (based on contractual
and/or trust principles) subordinates certain payment rights of a creditor to the payment rights of other
creditors of its counterparty upon the occurrence of insolvency proceedings relating to that creditor. In
particular, recent cases have focused on provisions involving the subordination of a hedging counterparty’s
payment rights in respect of certain termination payments upon the occurrence of insolvency proceedings
or other default on the part of such counterparty (so-called ‘‘flip clauses’’).

The English Supreme Court has held that a flip clause as described above is valid under English law.
Contrary to this, however, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court has held that such a subordination provision is
unenforceable under U.S. bankruptcy law and that any action to enforce such provision would violate the
automatic stay which applies under such law in the case of a U.S. bankruptcy of the counterparty. The
implications of this conflict remain unclear as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

If a creditor of the Issuer or a related entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings in any jurisdiction
outside England and Wales (including, but not limited to, the U.S.), and it is owed a payment by the Issuer,
a question arises as to whether the insolvent creditor or any insolvency official appointed in respect of that
creditor could successfully challenge the validity and/or enforceability of subordination provisions included
in the English law governed Transaction Documents. In particular, based on the decision of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court referred to above, there is a risk that such subordination provisions would not be upheld
under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Such laws may be relevant in certain circumstances with respect to a range of
entities which may act as hedging counterparty, including U.S. established entities and certain non-U.S.
established entities with assets or operations in the U.S. (although the scope of any such proceedings may
be limited if the relevant non-U.S. entity is a bank with a licensed branch in a U.S. state).

In general, if a subordination provision included in the Transaction Documents was successfully challenged
under the insolvency laws of any relevant jurisdiction outside England and Wales and any relevant foreign
judgment or order was recognised by the English courts, there can be no assurance that such actions would
not adversely affect the rights of the Noteholders, the market value of the Notes and/or the ability of the
Issuer to satisfy its obligations under the Notes.

Lastly, given the general relevance of the issues under discussion in the judgments referred to above and
that the Transaction Documents will include terms providing for such subordination, there is a risk that the
final outcome of the dispute in such judgments (including any recognition action by the English courts)
may result in negative rating pressure in respect of the Notes. If any rating assigned to the Notes is
lowered, the market value of the Notes may decline.

**TAX RISKS**

**_The Group may incur tax liabilities arising from potential changes in applicable tax law and practice_**

The statements in relation to taxation set out in this Offering Memorandum are based on current law and
the practice of the relevant authorities in force or applied at the date of this Offering Memorandum. Any
changes in such law or practice might have an adverse effect on the financial position of the Issuer or the
Guarantors.

**_Withholding tax in respect of the Intercompany Loan Agreement could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s_**
**_ability to make timely payments under the Notes_**

All payments made under the Intercompany Loan Agreement can be made without deduction or
withholding for or on account of any UK tax. In the event that, for example as a result of a change in tax
law, any withholding or deduction for or on account of tax is required to be made from any payment due to
the Issuer under the Intercompany Loan Agreement, the amount of that payment will be increased so that,
after such withholding or deduction has been made, the Issuer will receive a cash amount equal to the
amount that it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been required to be made. If the
Intercompany Borrower is obliged to increase any sum payable under any Intercompany Loan
corresponding to the Notes by it to the Issuer as a result of the Intercompany Borrower being required to
make a withholding or deduction from that payment, the Intercompany Borrower will have the option (but
not the obligation) to prepay all such outstanding Intercompany Loans made under the Intercompany
Loan Agreement in full. If the Intercompany Borrower chooses to prepay such Intercompany Loans under
the Intercompany Loan Agreement, the Issuer will then be required to redeem the Notes. Such
redemption would be for the outstanding principal amount, together with accrued but unpaid interest. If

73


-----

the Intercompany Borrower does not have sufficient funds to enable it to either repay the Intercompany
Loan Agreement or to make increased payments to the Issuer, the Issuer’s ability to make timely payments
of interest and principal under the Notes could be adversely affected.

**INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS**

**_Floating charges given by the Issuer or the Guarantors may be deemed invalid for lack of consideration which would_**
**_hinder the appointment of an administrative receiver_**

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provides that, in certain circumstances, a floating charge granted by
a company may be invalid in whole or in part. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid then it will
not be possible to appoint an administrative receiver of such company and, therefore, it will not be possible
to prevent the appointment of an administrator of such company. The risk is, if a liquidator or
administrator is appointed to the Issuer or any Guarantor within a period of two years (the relevant time)
commencing upon the date on which the Issuer or that Guarantor, as the case may be, grants a floating
charge, the floating charge granted by the Issuer or that Guarantor, as the case may be, will be invalid
pursuant to Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986 except to the extent of the consideration received by
the relevant charger at the time of or after the creation of the floating charge. The Issuer will have received
consideration (namely, the Issuer will issue Notes and will receive the subscription monies therefor) and
AF No 2 will have received such consideration by drawing under the corresponding Intercompany Loan.
As such, during the relevant time the floating charge granted by the Issuer will be valid to the extent of the
amount of Notes issued by the Issuer and the floating charge granted by AF No 2 will be valid to the extent
of the amount drawn by AF No 2 under the corresponding Intercompany Loan. After the relevant time it
will not be possible for the floating charges granted by each of the Issuer or the Guarantors to be
invalidated under Section 245 of the Insolvency Act 1986.

**_The ability of the Secured Creditors to appoint an administrative receiver may be hindered by the application of the_**
**_Enterprise Act 2002 in respect of floating charges_**

The provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Enterprise Act) restrict the right of the holder of a floating
charge to appoint an administrative receiver (unless the security was created prior to 15 September 2003 or
an exception applies) and instead give primacy to collective insolvency procedures (in particular,
administration).

The Insolvency Act 1986 contains provisions that continue to allow for the appointment of an
administrative receiver in relation to certain transactions in the capital markets. The relevant exception
provides that the appointment of an administrative receiver is not prohibited if it is made in pursuance of
an agreement which is or forms part of a capital market arrangement (as defined in the Insolvency Act
1986) under which a party incurs or, when such agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt
of at least £50,000,000 and if the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment (also
defined in the Insolvency Act 1986, but generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). Whilst there is
no case law, as yet, on how these provisions will be interpreted, it should be applicable to floating charges
created by the Issuer and the Guarantors. However, as this issue is partly a question of fact, were it not
possible to appoint an administrative receiver in respect of one or more of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
they would be subject to administration if they were to become insolvent.

The UK Secretary of State may, by secondary legislation, modify the exceptions to the prohibition on
appointing an administrative receiver and/or provide that the exception shall cease to have effect. No
assurance can be given that any such modification or provision in respect of the capital market exception,
or its ceasing to be applicable to the transactions described in this Offering Memorandum, will not be
detrimental to the interests of the Noteholders.

**_Restrictive covenants in the Transaction Documents may adversely affect the operations of the Group_**

The Transaction Documents to be entered into limit the Issuer and Guarantors’ ability, among other
things, to:

- incur indebtedness;

- provide guarantees;

- make investments;

- incur liens;

74


-----

- make certain restricted payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make acquisitions;

- make disposals; or

- merge or consolidate with another company.

In addition, the Conditions will restrict the ability of the Senior Obligors to, among other things:

- make investments or acquire any business;

- make disposals; or

- make certain modifications to the restricted payments or permitted business covenants in the
Common Terms Agreement.

Furthermore, the Conditions will restrict the ability of members of the Group (that are not the Issuer or
the Guarantors) to make restricted payments.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications, including intra-Group
transactions. See ‘‘Terms and Conditions’’ and ‘‘Summary of the Transaction Documents—Liquidity Facility
_Agreement’’. The covenants to which the Group is subject could limit its ability to finance future capital_
needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities that may be in its interest.

In addition, a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the financial
covenants under the Liquidity Facility could result in an Event of Default.

**_The holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

The Note Trustee is party to the Intercreditor Agreement with, among others, the Security Trustee and
representatives of the other senior debt secured by the Collateral, including the Liquidity Facility. Among
other things, the Intercreditor Agreement governs the enforcement of the Security Documents, the sharing
of any recoveries from such enforcement among such creditors and the release of the Collateral by the
Security Trustee. The Conditions will provide that each holder of Notes, by accepting a Note, will be
deemed to have agreed to be bound by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents.

Pursuant to the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the Liquidity
Facility Agreement, counterparties to super senior hedging agreements and any other future debt or
hedging obligations which are classed in the Intercreditor Agreement as super senior liabilities (the Super
**Senior Creditors) will have effective control with respect to the Collateral. The Intercreditor Agreement**
provides that a common security agent will serve as Security Trustee for the secured parties under the
Liquidity Facility and the Notes with respect to the shared Collateral. In the event that the shared
Collateral has become enforceable, the Security Agent shall enforce or refrain from enforcing such
Collateral on the instructions of (a) the majority (more than 66.7% by value) of the Super Senior Creditors
and (b) the majority (more than 50% by value) of the holders of the Notes and other pari passu creditors
(if any).

Further, disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes and the Super Senior Creditors as to the
appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the shared Collateral.
If the Super Senior Creditors or the holders of the Notes wish to instruct the Security Trustee to enforce
the Collateral they must firstly consult with each other and with the Security Trustee in good faith for a
period of 10 Business Days, subject to certain exceptions. If at the end of the consultation period the
Security Trustee still receives conflicting instructions from the majority Super Senior Creditors and from
the holders of a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes and pari passu indebtedness, then,
to the extent instructions from the holders of the Notes and the _pari passu creditors are given in_
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Trustee will comply with such instructions,
provided that, if the liabilities owed to the Super Senior Creditors have not been fully and finally
discharged in cash within six months of the end of the consultation period or if no enforcement has
occurred within three months of the end of the consultation period, the instructions of the majority Super
Senior Creditors will prevail.

The Super Senior Creditors may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes
and they may elect to pursue their remedies in respect of the shared Collateral at a time and in a manner
which would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so.

75


-----

In addition, if the Security Trustee sells Collateral comprising shares as a result of an enforcement action in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, related claims under the Notes and the Guarantees and
related liens over any other assets securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See ‘‘Summary
_of the Transaction Documents—Intercreditor Agreement’’._

**_The holders of the Notes may be limited in their ability to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the
Notes, but will be granted only in favour of the Security Trustee. The Intercreditor Agreement and the
Conditions will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, only the Security Trustee has the
right to enforce the Security Documents relating to the Collateral on behalf of the Note Trustee and the
holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security interests in the Collateral and be barred from taking enforcement action in respect of the
Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Note Trustee who will (subject to the provisions of such
Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Trustee.

In addition, the ability of the Security Trustee to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets, but
require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty
under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Notes that are
not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured.

**_The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes._**

The Collateral will secure on a first-ranking basis the Obligors’ obligations under the Notes, the Liquidity
Facility and certain hedging agreements. The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent
permitted by the terms of the Conditions, the Liquidity Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The rights of holders of the Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the firstranking debt secured by the Collateral.

No appraisals of any Collateral have been prepared in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value
of the Collateral and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon
many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, whether or not
the business is sold as a going concern and the general economic conditions of and the availability of
buyers. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such
assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Likewise, the Obligors cannot assure Noteholders that there will be a market for the sale of the
Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In
addition, the pledges, shares and ownership interests of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject
to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over certain of the Collateral, and the operation of the business or_**
**_the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive
control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, certain of the Collateral.
So long as no default or event of default under the Conditions would result therefrom, the Issuer and the
Guarantors, may, among other things, subject to the terms of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement (as applicable), without any release or consent by the applicable Note Trustee or
the Security Trustee, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral such as selling,
modifying, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash
payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities could reduce the value of the
Collateral, which could reduce the amounts payable to you from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral
in the case of an enforcement of the liens on the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal
perfection and other imperfections permitted under the Conditions and the Intercreditor Agreement and
accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking liens in the Collateral from time to time,

76


-----

whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects,
encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the
Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Trustee to realize or foreclose on such Collateral.
Furthermore, the first-ranking liens can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the
timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under English law.

The security interests of the Security Trustee will be subject to practical problems generally associated with
the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Security Trustee may need to obtain the
consent of a third party (including, without limitation, relevant governmental agencies, e.g., relevant
competition authorities) to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Trustee will
be able to obtain any such consents. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be
given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Trustee may not
have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under English law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the
grantor of the security. The liens in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if the Obligors or the Security Trustee fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any
of these liens. In addition, English law provides that a security interest over certain property and rights
acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a
certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and
rights are acquired and identified.

The Note Trustee and the Security Trustee will not monitor, and we may not comply with our obligations to
inform the Note Trustee or Security Trustee of, any future acquisition of property and rights by us, and the
necessary action may not be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired property
or rights. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral or
adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favour of the Notes against third parties, including a
trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of permitted debt_**
**_in the future may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Guarantees may create hardening periods for
such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future
indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in
particular, as the Conditions will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Notes
in certain circumstances including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable
hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has
been granted, perfected or recreated. At each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it
may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. To the extent that the grant
of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. The
same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over their
relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the applicable
Collateral or Guarantees will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.

Under various circumstances, the Collateral will be released, including:

- upon the later to occur of the discharge of all liabilities owing to the Pari Passu Creditors and the
discharge of all liabilities owing to the Super Senior Creditors;

- upon a non-distressed disposal under the Intercreditor Agreement; and

- in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral in connection with a Permitted
Transaction.

See ‘‘Summary of the Transaction Documents—Intercreditor Agreement—Release of the Guarantees and
_Transaction Security’’._

**_The Security Trustee will not monitor the Obligors’ compliance with warranties and covenants or the occurrence of_**
**_Events of Default; Events of Default may occur without the knowledge of the Security Trustee or the Note Trustee (as_**
**_applicable) if the Security Trustee or the Note Trustee (as applicable) does not receive notice of such event_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Trustee will be entitled to assume, unless it has
received notice to the contrary) that no Event of Default has occurred. The Security Trustee will not itself
monitor whether any such event has occurred. In addition, the Conditions of the Notes provide that the
Note Trustee is not responsible for monitoring compliance by the Issuer and the Guarantors with any of
their obligations under the Notes, the Note Trust Deed and the other Transaction Documents except by
means of receipt of a certificate from the Issuer which will state, among other things, that no Event of
Default is outstanding. The Note Trustee will not itself monitor whether any such event has occurred.

**_Creditors under the Liquidity Facility and certain debt that the Obligors may incur in the future will be entitled to be_**
**_repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes._**

The Notes will, as far as is possible under law, be secured by the same Collateral that secures, on a firstranking basis, the Obligors’ obligations under the Liquidity Facility and certain hedging obligations. The
Conditions will also permit the same Collateral to be pledged on a _pari passu basis with the Notes, to_
secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Intercreditor Agreement limits the amount of hedging that can be ‘‘super-priority’’ hedging.

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement,
the liabilities under the Liquidity Facility Agreement, as well as certain hedging obligations permitted to be
incurred in accordance with the Conditions and classed in the Intercreditor Agreement as super senior
liabilities and any other future debt or hedging obligations which are classed in the Intercreditor
Agreement as super senior liabilities, will have priority over the Notes in respect of any amounts received
from the sale of the Collateral pursuant to an enforcement action taken with respect to such Collateral.
Additionally, certain liabilities or obligations may have priority over or rank pari passu with the Notes in
respect of any amounts received from the sale of the Collateral due to the rules of the applicable laws
(including, without limitation, costs of enforcement actions, tax liabilities, liabilities to employees of a
bankrupt entity and fees payable to agents, attorneys and receivers). In the event of a foreclosure of the
Collateral, the Noteholders may not be able to recover on such Collateral to the extent that the then
outstanding claims under the Liquidity Facility Agreement and any super senior hedging obligations and
any other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness are greater than the proceeds realized. In addition, any proceeds
from an enforcement sale of the Collateral by any creditor will, after all obligations under the Liquidity
Facility Agreement, super senior hedging and other ‘‘super-priority’’ indebtedness have been discharged
from such recoveries, be applied pro rata in repayment of any other obligations secured by such Collateral.
Such additional indebtedness secured by the Collateral may be significant. As a result, holders of Notes
may receive less, ratably, than holders of other secured indebtedness.

**_Guarantees and security may constitute a transaction at an undervalue or preference_**

A liquidator or administrator of a Guarantor could apply to the court to unwind the issuance of its
guarantee if such liquidator or administrator believed that issuance of such constituted a transaction at an
undervalue. The Guarantors each believe that its Guarantee will not be a transaction at an undervalue and
that its Guarantee will be provided in good faith for the purposes of carrying on its business and its
Subsidiaries’ and that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the transactions will benefit each
such Guarantor. However, there can be no assurance that the provision of the Guarantees will not be
challenged by a liquidator or administrator or that a court would support this analysis.

If the liquidator or administrator can show that any of the Guarantors has given a ‘‘preference’’ to any
person within six months of the onset of liquidation or administration (or two years if the preference is to a
‘‘connected person’’) and, at the time of the preference, that Guarantor was technically insolvent or
became so as a result of the preferential transaction, a court has the power, among other things, to void the
preferential transaction. For these purposes, a company gives preference to a person if that person is one
of the company’s creditors (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) and the
company takes an action which has the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event of
the company going into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position that person would have been

78


-----

in if that thing had not been done. The court may not make an order avoiding a preferential transaction
unless it is satisfied that the company was influenced by a desire to put that person in a better position.
This provision of English insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by any of
Guarantors during the relevant period prior to the liquidation or administration of such Guarantor.

In addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by an English company was made for less
than fair value and was made to shield assets from creditors, then the transaction may be set aside as a
transaction defrauding creditors. Any person who is a ‘‘victim’’ of the transaction, and not just liquidators
or administrators, may assert such a claim. There is no statutory time limit within which a claim must be
made and the company need not be insolvent at the time of the transaction. The Guarantors do not believe
that they have entered into any transactions which may be regarded as being for less than fair value or to
shield assets from their creditors.

**_Fixed security interests may be recharacterised as floating security interests due to the degree of control exercised_**
**_over certain underlying assets, including over bank accounts, and as a result the full proceeds of enforcement may_**
**_not be available to repay the Notes_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interest expressed to be created by the
Security Agreement could take effect as a floating charge as the description given thereto as a fixed charge
is not determinative.

Whether the fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the Security Trustee has the requisite degree of
control over the relevant assets and exercises that control in practice.

Each Obligor has, pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreement, granted security over all of its interests
in the Security Accounts, which security is expressed to be a first fixed charge. Although the various bank
accounts are stated to be subject to various degrees of control, there is a risk that, if the Security Trustee
does not exercise the requisite degree of control over the relevant accounts in practice, a court could
determine that the security interests granted in respect of those accounts take effect as floating security
interests only and that the security interests granted over the assets from which the monies paid into the
accounts are derived also take effect as floating security interests only, notwithstanding that the security
interests are expressed to be fixed. In such circumstances, monies paid into accounts or derived from those
assets could be diverted to pay preferential creditors and certain other liabilities were a receiver, liquidator
or administrator to be appointed in respect of the relevant company in whose name the account is held.

If the fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) the
unsecured creditors of the relevant Obligor and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the
Obligors, may have priority over the rights of the Security Trustee to the proceeds of enforcement of such
security in accordance with s176A of the Insolvency Act 1986. To the extent that the assets of any Obligor
are subject only to a floating charge (including any fixed charge recharacterised by the courts as a floating
charge), in certain circumstances under the provisions of section 176A of the Insolvency Act 1986, certain
floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors
under the Security Agreement may be first used to satisfy any claims of unsecured creditors, up to an
amount equal to £600,000 in respect of each such Obligor. As a result, the full amount of the proceeds of
enforcement of the security may not be available to repay Notes.

On 6 April 2008, a provision in the Insolvency Act 1986 came into force which effectively reversed by
statute the House of Lords’ decision in the case of _Buchler & Another v Talbot & Ors [2004] UKHL 9._
Accordingly, it is now the case that the costs and expenses of a liquidation (including corporation tax on
capital gains) will be payable out of floating charge assets in priority to the claims of the floating chargeholder. In respect of certain litigation expenses of the liquidator only, this is subject to approval of the
amount of such expenses by the floating charge-holder (or, in certain circumstances, the court) pursuant to
provisions set out in the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (as amended). As a result of the
changes described above, upon the enforcement of the floating charge security granted by an Obligor,
floating charge realisations which would otherwise be available to satisfy the claims of secured creditors
under the Security Agreement will be reduced by at least a significant proportion of any liquidation
expenses.

**ISSUER AND NOTE CONSIDERATIONS**

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors are special purpose vehicles and have limited assets and limited ability to generate_**
**_revenue and will depend on their subsidiaries and affiliates to provide them with funds to meet the Issuer’s_**
**_obligations under the Notes_**

The Issuer is a special purpose financing entity. Other than the proceeds of the issuance of Notes, the
Issuer’s principal source of funds will be funds made available to it pursuant to the Intercompany Loan
Agreement.

Therefore, the Issuer is subject to all the risks relating to income and expenses to which the Intercompany
Borrower is subject. Such risks could limit funds available to the Intercompany Borrower to enable the
Intercompany Borrower to satisfy in full and on a timely basis its obligations under the Intercompany
Loans.

Similarly, each Guarantor is a non-operating holding company with no material, direct business operations.
The principal assets of the Guarantors are the equity interests they directly or indirectly hold in their
operating holding subsidiaries (primarily Arqiva Group Holdings Limited, Operating HoldCo). As a result,
the Guarantors are dependent on loans, interest, dividends and other payments from their Subsidiaries to
generate the funds necessary to meet their financial obligations, including in the case of the Intermediate
Guarantor (in its capacity as the Intercompany Borrower) the repayment of any Intercompany Loans. The
Guarantors’ Subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, except for the Issuer and the
Guarantors, they will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or
to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividends, distributions, advances, loans or
other payments. Accordingly, risks that have an impact on the Subsidiaries of each Guarantor could affect
the amount of funds available to each Guarantor to enable the Guarantors to satisfy in full and on a timely
basis their obligations under the Guarantee (in the case of each Guarantor) and the Intercompany Loan
Agreement (in the case of the Intermediate Guarantor only).

**_Noteholders are structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of the Guarantors’ Subsidiaries, including the_**
**_secured creditors of Operating HoldCo under the Senior Financing_**

The Guarantors’ Subsidiaries do not guarantee the Notes. The ability of the Guarantors’ Subsidiaries to
make such distributions and other payments depends on their earnings and may be subject to statutory or
contractual restrictions. As an equity investor in its Subsidiaries, each Guarantor’s right to receive assets
upon their liquidation or reorganisation will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors of their
Subsidiaries. To the extent that a Guarantor is recognised as a creditor of any such Subsidiary, such
Guarantor’s claims may still be subordinated to any security interest in or other lien on the assets of such
Subsidiaries and to any of their debt or other obligations. The Group’s senior gross debt was £2,318 million
as at 30 June 2018.

**_A downgrade of the ratings of the Senior Notes could limit the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes_**

If a Rating Downgrade Event occurs in connection with the Senior Notes, and whilst no Senior Trigger
Event has occurred and is continuing, a Senior Financing Group Company may only make Senior
Restricted Payments to the extent that such Senior Restricted Payments are used exclusively to pay interest
and repay principal on the Subordinated Loans for the purpose of Intermediate HoldCo paying interest
and repaying principal to the Intercompany Borrower and the Intercompany Borrower paying interest and
repaying principal to the Issuer (in its capacity as the Intercompany Lender) on the Intercompany Loans
and the Issuer paying interest on the Notes and on any Facility and any senior expenses (as applicable).

In addition, if such Rating Downgrade Event occurs simultaneously with a Senior Trigger Event
continuing, no Senior Financing Group Company may make any Senior Restricted Payments (unless such
payments are made in accordance with a Remedial Plan).

In such circumstances, the Rating Downgrade Event occurring in relation to the Senior Notes would have
an impact on the amounts received by the Issuer under the Intercompany Loans, which could then in turn
impact the Issuer’s ability to make corresponding payments on the Notes.

80


-----

**_The occurrence of a Senior Trigger Event, including a breach by a Senior Financing Group Company of a Senior_**
**_Trigger Event Financial Covenant Ratio, could limit the ability of the Issuer to make payments on the Notes_**

Whilst a Senior Trigger Event is continuing, including as a result of a breach by the Senior Financing
Group of the Senior Trigger Event Financial Covenant Ratios, a Senior Financing Group Company is not
permitted to make Senior Restricted Payments and any Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Common
Terms Agreement) of the Senior Financing Group will be locked-up within the Senior Financing Group
and cannot in turn be distributed to AF No 2. This will effect AF No 2’s ability as the Intercompany
Borrower to pay interest and principal under the Intercompany Loans to the Issuer which will therefore
negatively affect the Issuer’s ability to make payments on the Notes.

**_The Obligors may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control (as defined in the Conditions), the
Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, it is not assured
that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
or the Obligors’ other then-existing contractual obligations would allow them to make such required
repurchases. A change of control may result in an event of default and/or mandatory prepayment
obligation under, or acceleration of, the Liquidity Facility and other indebtedness. The repurchase of the
Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement and other
indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. In addition, certain events that may constitute a
change of control under the Liquidity Facility may not constitute a change of control under the Conditions.
The future indebtedness of the Obligors and its subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions on certain
events that would constitute a change of control or require the Obligors to repay or repurchase such other
indebtedness on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a change of control. See ‘‘Terms and
_Conditions’’._

The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the
Notes following the occurrence of a change of control may be limited by the Obligors’ then existing
financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when the Obligors’ subsidiaries
are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, the
subsidiaries may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or
may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such
borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, the
Obligors expect that they would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control and the Obligors may not be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the
Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Conditions which would, in turn,
constitute a default under the Liquidity Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness.

The change of control provisions contained in the Conditions may not necessarily afford protection in the
event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring or other similar
transactions involving the Group that may adversely affect Noteholders, because such corporate events
may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a
‘‘change of control’’ as defined in the Conditions. Except as described under ‘‘Terms and Conditions’’, the
Conditions will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction.

**_Investors in the Notes may have limited recourse against the independent auditors._**

Please see ‘‘General Information—Independent Auditors’’ for a description of the independent auditors’
reports, including language limiting the auditors’ scope of duty in relation to such reports and the
consolidated financial statements to which they relate. In particular, each of the audit reports of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP relating to the annual financial statements reproduced herein, in accordance
with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, include a statement to the effect that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to anyone
other than the members of the Parent Guarantor for its audit reports or the opinions it has formed.

**_The Issuer relies on certain third parties for certain services in relation to the Notes_**

The Issuer has entered into agreements with a number of third parties, which have agreed to perform
services for the Issuer and the Intermediate Guarantor (in particular, in its capacity as Intercompany
Borrower). In the event that any of those parties fails to perform its obligations under the relevant
agreement to which it is a party, the ability of the Issuer to make payments owed in respect of the Notes
may be affected.

**_The Notes will be held in book-entry form and therefore potential Noteholders must rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights or remedies_**

The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more Global Notes that may be deposited with a common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in each
Global Note, investors will not be entitled to receive Notes in definitive form. Each of Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg and their respective direct and indirect participants will maintain records of the
beneficial interest in each Global Note held through it. While the Notes are represented by a Global Note,
investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only through the relevant clearing systems and their
respective participants.

While Notes are represented by Global Notes, the Issuer will discharge its payment obligation under the
Notes by making payments through the relevant clearing system. A holder of a beneficial interest in a
Global Note must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing system and its participants to receive
payments under the Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records relating to, or
payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in any Global Note.

Holders of beneficial interests in a Global Note will not have a direct right to vote in respect of the Notes
so represented. Instead, such holders will be permitted to act only to the extent that they are enabled by
the relevant clearing system and its participants to appoint appropriate proxies.

**_The interests of the Obligors’ controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of Notes._**

The interests of the Obligors’ principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with the
interests of holders of Notes. The Obligors’ principal shareholders have, and will continue to have, directly
or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the legal and capital structure and day-to-day
operations, as well as the ability to elect and change management and to approve any other changes to
operations. For example, the principal shareholders could vote to cause the Obligors’ to incur additional
indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends distributions, in each case, so long as the
Conditions, the Liquidity Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The interests of
the principal shareholders could conflict with interests of holders of Notes, particularly if the Obligors
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay their debts when due. The principal shareholders could
also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments although such transactions
might involve risks to the holders of Notes. In addition, the principal shareholders may come to own
businesses that directly compete with the business of the Group.

**_There may be no active trading market for the Notes, and if one develops, it may not be liquid_**

There can be no assurances as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- the ability of the Noteholders to sell their Notes; or

- the prices at which Noteholders would be able to sell their Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing
interest rates, the Group’s operating results and the market for similar securities.

Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to
disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. Any such disruptions may adversely
affect the value of the Notes and may have a negative effect on any Noteholder, regardless of the Group’s

82


-----

prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading
market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, Noteholders may not be able to resell their
Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application has been made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List and to be admitted to
trading on the Euro MTF Market, there can be no assurance that the Notes will become or remain listed.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on
the Euro MTF Market, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes, as applicable, from
the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to
resell the Notes, as applicable in the secondary market.

**_Notes subject to optional redemption by the Issuer may have a lower market value than Notes that cannot be_**
**_redeemed_**

An optional redemption feature of the Notes is likely to limit their market value. During any period when
the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of those Notes generally will not rise
substantially above the price at which they may be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any
redemption period.

The Issuer may elect to redeem the relevant Notes in advance of their scheduled maturity date by giving
notice to the relevant Noteholders in accordance with the Conditions. For example, the Issuer may redeem
Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on the Notes depending on the price the
applicable Notes may be redeemed at. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest
the redemption proceeds at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes and may only
be able to do so at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light
of other investments available at that time.

**_Rating Agency assessments, downgrades and changes to Rating Agencies criteria may result in ratings volatility on_**
**_the Notes_**

The ratings assigned by the Rating Agencies to the Notes reflect only the views of the Rating Agencies and
in assigning the ratings, the Rating Agencies take into consideration the credit quality of the Obligors and
structural features and other aspects of the transaction. There is no assurance that any such ratings will
continue for any period of time or that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely
by the Rating Agencies as a result of changes in, or unavailability of, information or if, in the Rating
Agencies’ judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any rating assigned to the Notes is lowered or withdrawn,
the market value of the Notes may be reduced. Future events, including events affecting the Obligors
and/or the Group and/or circumstances relating to the industry in which the Group operates generally,
could have an adverse impact on the ratings of the Notes.

A confirmation from a Rating Agency that any action proposed to be taken by the Issuer or the Note
Trustee will not have an adverse effect on the then current rating of the relevant Notes does not, for
example, confirm that such action (i) is permitted by the terms of the Transaction Documents or (ii) is in
the best interests of, or not prejudicial to, the Noteholders. While each of the Secured Creditors (including
the Noteholders), the Issuer or the Note Trustee (as applicable) are entitled to have regard to the fact that
the Rating Agencies have confirmed that the then current rating of the relevant class of Notes would not
be adversely affected, the above does not impose or extend any actual or contingent liability on the Rating
Agencies to the Secured Creditors (including the Noteholders), the Issuer, the Note Trustee or any other
person or create any legal relationship between the Rating Agencies and the Secured Creditors (including
the Noteholders), the Issuer, the Note Trustee or any other person whether by way of contract or
otherwise.

Any such confirmation from a Rating Agency may or may not be given at the sole discretion of each Rating
Agency. It should be noted that, depending on the timing of delivery of the request and any information
required to be provided as part of any such request, it may be the case that a Rating Agency cannot
provide a confirmation in the time available or at all, and the Rating Agency is likely to state that it is not
responsible for the consequences thereof. A confirmation from a Rating Agency, if given, will be given on
the basis of the facts and circumstances prevailing at the relevant time and in the context of cumulative
changes to the transaction of which the securities form part. A confirmation from a Rating Agency
represents only a restatement of the then current rating of the Notes and cannot be construed as advice for
the benefit of any parties to the transaction.

83


-----

The Rating Agencies have indicated that they will no longer provide confirmations as a matter of policy. To
the extent that a confirmation from a Rating Agency cannot be obtained, whether or not a proposed action
will ultimately take place will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the relevant Transaction
Documents and specifically the relevant modification and waiver provisions.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks relating to the Notes_**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may
not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed above
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy,
sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by its assigning rating agency at any time.

In general, European regulated investors are restricted under Regulation (EC) No. 1060/2009 (the **CRA**
**Regulation) from using credit ratings for regulatory purposes, unless such ratings are issued by a credit**
rating agency established in the European Union (the EU) and registered under the CRA Regulation (and
such registration has not been withdrawn or suspended), subject to transitional provisions that apply in
certain circumstances whilst the registration application is pending. Such general restriction will also apply
in the case of credit ratings issued by non-EU credit rating agencies, unless the relevant credit ratings are
endorsed by an EU-registered credit rating agency or the relevant non-EU rating agency is certified in
accordance with the CRA Regulation (and such endorsement action or certification, as the case may be,
has not been withdrawn or suspended).

The list of registered and certified rating agencies published by the European Securities and Markets
Authority (ESMA) on its website in accordance with the CRA Regulation is not conclusive evidence of the
status of the relevant rating agency included in such list, as there may be delays between certain
supervisory measures being taken against a relevant rating agency and the publication of the updated
ESMA list.

**_Exchange rate risks and exchange controls may result in investors receiving less interest or principal than expected_**

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in sterling. This presents certain risks to currency
conversion if an investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or currency unit
other than the specified currency (the **Investor’s Currency). These include risk that exchange rates may**
significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the specified currency or revaluation of the
Investor’s Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the specified Investor’s Currency
may impose or modify exchange controls. An appreciation of value of the Investor’s Currency relative to
the specified currency would decrease (1) the Investor’s Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the
Investor’s Currency equivalent value of the principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor’s Currency
equivalent market value of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that
could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or
principal than expected or no interest or principal.

**_Changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Notes_**

The Notes pay a fixed rate of interest. Investment in fixed rate Notes involves the risk that subsequent
changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of such fixed rate Notes.

**_General market volatility and post-Brexit uncertainty_**

On 23 June 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European
Union. The UK voted to leave the European Union and the UK Government invoked article 50 of the
Lisbon Treaty relating to withdrawal on 29 March 2017. Under article 50, the Treaty on the European
Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union cease to apply in the relevant state from
the date of entry into force of a withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification of
intention to withdraw, although this period may be extended in certain circumstances.

There are a number of uncertainties in connection with the future of the UK and its relationship with the
European Union after 29 March 2019. The negotiation of the UK’s exit terms and related matters may
take several years. Until the terms and timing of the UK’s exit from the European Union are confirmed
and until the nature of the new relationship between the UK and the European Union is known, it is not
possible to determine the impact that the referendum, the UK’s departure from the European Union

and/or any related matters may have on general economic conditions in the UK and/or on the business of
the Group or any other party to the Transaction Documents or on the regulatory position of any such
entity or of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents under EU regulation or more
generally. See also ‘‘—Business And Industry Risks—The Group is subject to UK government and other
_regulations that govern the way it conducts its businesses, and the effects of, or changes in, regulations and_
_government policy could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition and_
_results of operations’’; and ‘‘—Business And Industry Risks—The Group is subject to UK and global economic_
_conditions’’._

No assurance can be given that any of the matters outlined above would not adversely affect the ability of
the Guarantors to satisfy their obligations under the Guarantees and Issuer to satisfy its obligations under
the Notes and/or the market value or liquidity of the Notes.

**_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and value of the Notes_**

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the
securities laws of any jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to
an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
any other applicable laws. The offering of the Notes (and beneficial interests therein) will be made
pursuant to exemptions from the registration provisions of the Securities Act and from other securities
laws. Accordingly, reoffers, resales, pledges and other transfers of the Notes (and beneficial interests
therein) are subject to certain transfer restrictions. Potential Noteholders should read the discussions in
‘‘Transfer Restrictions’’ for further information about these and other transfer restrictions. It is the
obligation of each Noteholder to ensure that its offers and sales of Notes comply with applicable law.
Potential Noteholders are advised to consult legal counsel in connection with any such reoffer, resale,
pledge or other transfer.

**_If the share security under the Security Agreement is enforced, the Parent Guarantor may no longer be a direct_**
**_shareholder of the Issuer and may no longer be a shareholder of the Intermediate Guarantor_**

The Parent Guarantor has granted share security over shares in its direct Subsidiaries, including the
Intermediate Guarantor and the Issuer, pursuant to the Security Agreement. If the Secured Creditors elect
to enforce their rights thereunder, then such security over the shares in the Intermediate Guarantor and
the Issuer may be enforced and such enforcement may result in a sale of the Intermediate Guarantor
and/or the Issuer and therefore the Parent Guarantor no longer being an indirect shareholder of
Intermediate HoldCo and its Subsidiaries (including the operating companies in the Group).

**_If the share security under the Security Agreement is enforced, the Intermediate Guarantor may no longer be a_**
**_shareholder of Intermediate HoldCo_**

The Intermediate Guarantor has granted share security over shares in its direct subsidiary, Intermediate
HoldCo, pursuant to the Security Agreement. If the Secured Creditors elect to enforce their rights
thereunder, then such security over the shares in Intermediate HoldCo may be enforced and such
enforcement may result in a sale of Intermediate HoldCo and therefore the Intermediate Guarantor no
longer being a direct shareholder of Intermediate HoldCo or an indirect shareholder in its Subsidiaries
(including the operating companies in the Group).

**_If the share security under the Security Agreement is enforced, Intermediate HoldCo may no longer be a shareholder_**
**_of the Senior Parent_**

Intermediate HoldCo has granted share security over shares in its direct subsidiary, the Senior Parent,
pursuant to the Security Agreement. If the Secured Creditors elect to enforce their rights thereunder, then
such security over the shares in the Senior Parent may be enforced and such enforcement may result in a
sale of the Senior Parent and therefore Intermediate HoldCo no longer being a direct shareholder of the
Senior Parent or an indirect shareholder in its Subsidiaries (including the operating companies in the
Group).

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The Group estimates that net proceeds (net of transaction fees and expenses) from the issuance of the
Notes offered hereby will be approximately £600.0 million.

The proceeds of the Notes will be on-lent by the Issuer to AF No 2 by way of Intercompany Loans under
the Intercompany Loan Agreement. AF No 2 will use the proceeds of the Intercompany Loans to repay in
full (together with the related make-whole premium of £14.3 million) and terminate the £600.0 million of
Existing Intercompany Loans. The Issuer will use the proceeds from the repayment by AF No 2 of the
Existing Intercompany Loans to (i) redeem the Existing Issuer Debt in full (together with the related
make-whole premium of £14.3 million), (ii) to pay any related transaction fees and expenses of £8.0 million
and (iii) to fund cash on the Group’s balance sheet of £2.7 million to be used for general corporate
purposes. The following table describes the sources and uses in connection with the refinancing as if they
occurred as at 30 June 2018 and based on amount estimated to be raised by the Notes offered hereby. The
actual amounts as compared to those set out in the table and in the accompanying footnotes are subject to

**Other Financial Data**

The tables below present certain non-IFRS financial measures as at and for the years ended 30 June 2016,
2017 and 2018. The Group believes that these measures provide useful information with respect to the
performance of its business and operations. These non-IFRS financial measures are not audited. They are
not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for metrics of financial performance reported in
accordance with IFRS. Moreover, these measures may be defined or calculated differently by other
companies and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similar measures calculated by the Group’s
peers. See ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures’’.

(1) EBITDA is presented to aid understanding of the Group’s results of operations and financial condition. The Group defines
EBITDA as operating profit (taken from the Group’s consolidated income statement data) before depreciation and
amortisation, impairment charges, exceptional administrative expenses and one-off items where the earnings or charges are not
considered to be indicative of the Group’s on-going operations, e.g. profit or loss on the disposal of non-current assets, as well
as certain other items.

EBITDA is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, nor presented in accordance with, IFRS.
EBITDA is not a measure of performance under IFRS and investors should not consider EBITDA as an alternative to
(a) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) as a measure of the Group’s operating
performance, (b) cash flows from operating investing and financing activities as a measure to meet the Group’s cash needs or
(c) any other measures of performance under IFRS or generally accepted accounting principles. Investors should exercise
caution in comparing EBITDA as reported by the Group to EBITDA of other companies.

EBITDA has been included in this Offering Memorandum because it is a measure that the Group’s management uses to assess
the Group’s operating performance. Please see ‘‘Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial
_Measures’’ for information on the limitations of EBITDA as an analytical tool._

**Overview**

The Group is the UK’s pre-eminent national provider of television and radio broadcast infrastructure and
the leading independent provider of communications infrastructure to mobile network operators (MNOs)
in the UK. In addition, the Group has been an early participant in the development of
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) infrastructure in the UK through its smart water and energy metering
services and through other Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions. The Group is also a leading provider of
satellite uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of
channels available for UK DTH satellite broadcast. The Group’s unique and long-life asset base enables it
to generate revenues underpinned by long-term inflation-linked contracts, as demonstrated by a strong
orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018, with significant revenue visibility. Approximately 85.6% of the
Group’s actual revenues realised in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at 30 June
2017.

The Group operates through three main business units, which correspond to its three reporting segments,
except for its Other reporting segment, which includes non-revenue generating central corporate functions.

- _Terrestrial Broadcast—The Group benefits from a regulated position as the sole UK national provider_
of transmission services for digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting, the most popular
television broadcast platform in the UK in terms of the number of homes served. The Group operates
all television transmission sites used for DTT broadcasting in the UK, with over 1,100 sites covering
98.5% of the UK population. Through its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market
leader for the provision of access to the DTT platform for broadcast channels, owning two national
commercial DVB-T Multiplexes and a further two High Definition (HD) capable DVB-T2 Multiplexes
(DVB-T2 Multiplexes) used for transmission of DTT services in the UK. The Group’s DTT Multiplexes
carried 62 out of a total of 113 DTT channels in the UK as at 30 June 2018. DTT, through the
subscription-free platform, Freeview, enables the public service broadcasters (PSBs) to meet the
obligation under their licences to extend coverage to 98.5% of the UK population. The Group
believes that DTT has a long-term future as the most economic model to provide free-to-air (FTA)
television providing near-universal coverage in the UK, which it expects will be complemented, but
not replaced by, certain ‘‘over-the-top’’ (OTT) services. The Group believes that there will remain a
long-term need for a highly economic source of FTA linear TV available to the UK population and
believes that the DTT platform, as complemented by OTT services, is best placed to deliver this.

The Group also benefits from its regulated position as the leading UK national provider of radio
broadcast transmission services, covering both analogue and digital services through Digital Audio
Broadcast (DAB). The Group had radio network infrastructure comprising approximately 1,735
analogue transmitters and 990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites in the UK as at 30 June 2018. The
Group is also the operator of the two national commercial digital radio multiplexes (including through
JVs) and held 25 of the UK’s 57 local DAB radio licences as at 30 June 2018. Further, the Group is
the service provider for the BBC national digital radio Multiplex. The Group intends to support its
customers and the industry by continuing to develop digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for
listeners and planning for the expected eventual phase-out of analogue radio, rolling out DAB to fill
the remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default replacement network for analogue
services.

- _Telecoms & M2M—Through its Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the largest_
independent (i.e. not directly or indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites

95


-----

in the UK, which the Group licenses to national MNOs and other wireless network operators to allow
them to provide services and coverage to their customers. The Group had approximately 8,000 active
licensed wireless sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. A significant proportion of
the Group’s active licensed wireless sites carried MNO equipment, which the Group estimates
represented approximately 21% of the total active licensed MNO macrocell site market as at 30 June
2018. It holds a strong and difficult-to-replicate position in rural and suburban regions where cost,
economies of scale, planning permission restrictions, application regimes with local authorities and
the secure nature of site leases (given the landlord’s limited ability to terminate the lease) would make
it difficult for competitors and MNO customers to replicate the Group’s infrastructure and footprint.
In addition, the Group provides installation services for the passive components (such as antennas and
feeders) of network upgrades and roll-outs on its own wireless infrastructure sites. The Group is also
positioning itself to be a leading provider of outdoor small cells infrastructure, having obtained access
to street infrastructure in 14 London boroughs. In addition, the Group provides indoor and outdoor
Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) in the UK, with 46 in-building systems installed in UK locations
as at 30 June 2018. The Group is also a leading provider of smart metering and M2M networks, with a
long-term contract to provide smart metering communication services in northern England and
Scotland for electricity and gas to approximately 7.0 million premises with SMETS2 (the second
generation of Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications) devices by 2020. In addition, the
Group provides a smart metering network for Thames Water that is expected to cover three million
homes once fully deployed and has entered into a trial contract with Anglian Water for smart metering
deployment.

- _Satellite & Media—The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit is a leading provider of satellite_
uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of channels
uplinked for UK Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite broadcast. The Satellite & Media business unit
serves as an alternative for customers who do not wish to self-manage access, with an estimated
outsourced market share of approximately 48% of fully managed channels as at 30 June 2018. The
Group operates more than 80 uplink dishes in five teleports (ground stations that act as a hub to
connect a satellite network to a terrestrial telecommunications network), accessing more than 30
satellites and delivering media content to five continents. The Group also procures third party groundbased teleport services where a line of sight to a satellite cannot be achieved from its UK assets. This
infrastructure enables the Group to provide customers with a comprehensive range of services to
deliver their data, broadcasts and media services internationally, focusing on the UK utility sector,
oil & gas sector, and aviation & maritime sectors. In addition, the Group provides encryption,
multiplexing, uplinking and satellite space to channel operators through its media distribution
offering. The Group also provides media management services, including linear playout (preparing
and transmitting content to distribution centres), video-on-demand, streaming, metadata management
and other OTT services. The Group also provides over 100,000 miles of cable for leased fibre
connectivity.

The Group has demonstrated revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years with revenue of
£884.0 million, £941.3 million and £962.4 million, and EBITDA of £428.4 million, £473.5 million and
£517.5 million, for the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

**Recent Developments**

The Group expects to appoint Michael William Darcey as a Director and as a member of the Nominations
Committee in September 2018. Mr Darcey has over 25 years of experience in the technology, media and
telecommunications industry with numerous positions held ranging from CEO of News International to
COO of British Sky Broadcasting Group. Mr Darcey has also provided strategic advisory services to a
range of clients in the media industry. Mr Darcey has served or is currently serving on the boards of Dennis
Publishing (UK) Ltd (Chairman), M24Seven (Chairman), Home Retail Group (Senior Independent
Director) and Sky New Zealand. Mr Darcey holds an MSc Economics, Microeconomics & Capital Markets
from the London School of Economics. Mr Darcey’s appointment is subject to CPP Investment Board
approval.

**Key Factors Affecting the Group’s Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

The Group’s results of operations and financial condition are affected by a variety of factors, a number of
which are outside the control of the Group. Set out below is a discussion of the most significant factors that
have affected the Group’s results during the periods under review and which it currently expects to affect

96


-----

its financial results in the future. Factors other than those set forth below could also have a significant
impact on the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in the future.

**_Impact of major project roll-outs in primary business units on revenue_**

The Group’s revenue growth in the periods under review has been driven by major project roll-outs in the
Terrestrial Broadcast and the Telecoms & M2M business units.

In the Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment, the increase in revenue has been driven primarily by the
ongoing 700 MHz clearance programme, including spectrum planning, network design programme
management, infrastructure changes, service continuity, asset replacement and retuning of broadcast
transmitters, which has seen a considerable increase in activity over the three years ended 30 June 2018,
the increased coverage resulting from the DAB roll-out and the expansion of commercial DAB Multiplex
capacity.

In the Telecoms & M2M reporting segment, revenue increased primarily due to increased site share
assignments and additional change request activity and network operating revenues following the roll-out
of the smart metering network for gas and electricity providers in northern England and Scotland.

**_A large portion of the Group’s revenues for its Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment are subject to the_**
**_Undertakings_**

For historical reasons related to the degree of competition, the Group’s terrestrial transmission services for
DTT and radio provided by its Terrestrial Broadcast division are subject to regulation in the form of
Reference Offers. The Undertakings and procedures established by Ofcom require the Group to publish
Reference Offers setting out terms for access to its network infrastructure whenever any relevant new
spectrum becomes available for broadcast purposes or when an existing contract for transmission services
is renewed. Under the Reference Offer framework, pricing for transmission services can be reviewed by
OTA-BTS. The Group is permitted to pass through to customers certain costs such as rent, taxes,
electricity and operating costs. Moreover, the Group’s DTT transmission services contracts are inflationlinked, and otherwise set so as to deliver a fixed rate of return relative to the underlying asset base. As a
result of these features of the Undertakings, the Group’s existing contractual terms and the fact that there
are no scheduled regulatory reviews of customer contracts once contractually agreed, the Group benefits
from a degree of long-term revenue visibility. See ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United
_Kingdom—Competition Regulation—The Undertakings’’._

In the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and June 2018, revenue for the Terrestrial Broadcast division was
£254.1 million, £273.2 million and £314.4 million, respectively, which represented 60.2%, 60.8% and 64.5%,
respectively, of segment revenue of £422.4 million, £449.0 million and £487.6 million for the Terrestrial
Broadcast reporting segment for the corresponding periods. The increase in DTT transmission services
revenue was largely inflation linked.

In the year ended 30 June 2015, OTA-BTS reviewed the Group’s regulatory pricing framework, resulting in
a minor adjustment to the regulated return allowed on new capital investments. In its decision, OTA-BTS
indicated that the revised return allowed on new capital investments would remain valid until 2025, but
that it retains the ability to conduct an intermediate review prior to such date. Accordingly, the Group’s
revenue has not been significantly impacted by the most recent OTA-BTS review, and the Group has no
expectation that another review of the return allowed on new capital investments will occur in the near
future. The Group therefore expects its transmission services revenue to be linked with inflation in the
medium term.

**_Increased demand for, and greater volume of, DTT channels/streams_**

Revenue from the Group’s Digital Platforms division has increased at a CAGR of 5.6% from the year
ended 30 June 2014 to the year ended 30 June 2018, growing from £139 million to £173 million, which has
been driven by increased demand for Freeview channels from broadcasters and advances in compression
technology that have increased the number of streams available for sale on the Group’s DVB-T
Multiplexes from 28 streams in the year ended 30 June 2014 to 31 streams in the year ended 30 June 2018.
A stream is a 24-hour slot which can be used by multiple channels if the channels are not
broadcasting 24/7. The pricing of Multiplex streams is determined by: (1) the amount of revenue
(predominantly advertising, but also transactions and subscriptions) that can be generated based on the
size and demographic make-up of the audience that the broadcaster can reach; and (2) the balance

97


-----

between supply of streams and demand from broadcasters requiring access to streams to broadcast their
content.

The average price for access to DVB-T streams remained relatively flat over the three years ended 30 June
2018 as available capacity increased in line with demand. The Group has achieved strong capacity
utilisation with average levels of approximately 98% on its DVB-T Multiplexes for the periods under
review. The Group has also experienced increased stream utilisation on the Group’s HD DVB-T2
Multiplexes. These streams are only available to viewers with HD television (DVB-T2/MPEG-4) sets or
set-top boxes and maximum coverage is currently only approximately 73% of the UK population,
compared to approximately 91% and 98.5% for commercial and PSB multiplexes, respectively, on the
Group’s DVB-T Multiplexes (Source: Ofcom). This lower coverage, combined with fewer viewers being
able to access these channels, has resulted in lower value and lower utilisation levels of channel capacity,
with utilisation of 85% for the COM 7 and COM 8 Multiplexes in the year ended 30 June 2018.

The Group has historically been successful in creating additional streams through technological
improvements, such as improved compression and modulation technologies, and expects that this trend
will continue over the medium term. The Group expects this will, in turn, increase the number of channels
it is able to sell to broadcasters, which it expects will be partially offset by the revocation or expiry of the
Group’s DVB-T2 Multiplexes, which will remain in place until at least 2020. See ‘‘Regulation of the
_Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Spectrum Regulation—Multiplex Licences—700 MHz_
_Clearance Project and DVB-T2 Multiplex licences’’._

**_Impact of capital expenditures_**

The Group has significant infrastructure requirements and its ability to provide television and radio
broadcast infrastructure and communications services to major distributors of media, wireless voice, data
and smart metering services depends largely on its ability to provide attractive and competitive product
offerings to its customers by maintaining, upgrading and expanding its asset base. In the periods under
review, the Group’s capital investments in major projects have been a key driver of revenue growth across
its businesses.

The Group typically incurs growth and other capital expenditure based on its contractual commitments,
keeping speculative capital expenditure to a minimum. The Group’s total contracted growth capital
expenditures amounted to £145.7 million, £129.5 million and £121.7 million in the years ended 30 June
2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, representing 84.9%, 78.4% and 77.7% of total capital expenditure for
the corresponding periods. Significant contracted growth capital expenditures for the period under review
included investments relating to the roll-out of smart metering networks (predominantly under the
Group’s contract with the DCC), the DAB roll-out and the 700 MHz clearance programme. The Group
believes that the investment cycle relating to these projects has peaked, and investment is expected to fall
over the coming years as the capital expenditures for the 700 MHz clearance programme are due to be
delivered in 2020, the DAB roll-out is expected to reach its peak from 2020 to 2026, and the roll-out of the
Group’s smart metering networks will have largely been completed in the year ended 30 June 2018, with
only change requests expected over the coming years in response to incremental industry specifications.

The Group’s maintenance capital expenditure does not include capital expenditure related to retaining
revenues and customer-funded maintenance capital expenditure. The Group’s maintenance capital
expenditure relates to capital expenditure that is incurred to deliver cost-savings and productivity
enhancements, to extend the useful life of existing non-current assets, and to replace worn out and
obsolete non-current assets with new ones in order to support existing contracts. The Group dedicates
some capital expenditure to retaining certain clients and contracts, from time to time. The Group’s total
maintenance capital expenditures amounted to £20.4 million, £22.5 million and £30.3 million in the years
ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, representing 11.9%, 13.6% and 19.3% of total capital

98


-----

expenditure for the corresponding periods. The increase in maintenance capital expenditure for the year
ended 30 June 2018 related to the Group’s IT transformation efforts as part of the FutureFit programme.
The Group has historically maintained tight control of maintenance capital expenditures through stringent
management oversight and efficiency measures. The Group expects that its maintenance capital
expenditure requirements in the medium term are sustainable and will be in line with current levels. See
‘‘—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Net cash flows—Net capital expenditure and financial investment’’.

**_Changes to product mix_**

During the period under review, the Group has sought to shift its product mix, which (together with the
impact of the Group’s cost savings programmes described below) contributed to an increase in EBITDA
margin from 48% in the year ended 30 June 2016 to 54% in the year ended 30 June 2018.

In the Telecoms & M2M reporting segment, the Group has exited non-core and sub-scale businesses,
including WiFi and Secure Solutions. In the year ended 30 June 2018, the Group has also started to wind
down its low margin installations services contracts after successfully supporting the MNOs with 4G
roll-out and meeting their coverage obligations. The Group’s revenue from installations services has been
replaced by revenue from higher margin site sharing contracts, which has increased by approximately
£8 million in the three year period ended 30 June 2018, driven by additional site assignment through site
transfer programmes with the Group’s MNO customers. In addition, in the M2M division, the Group has
experienced further margin expansion as a result of the completion of the smart energy metering network
roll-out, further change requests and new smart water metering contracts.

In the Satellite and Media reporting segment, the Group has reduced its exposure to lower margin
contracts, particularly in the wholesale satellite space and other non-core businesses, and has been
rationalising its cost base primarily through satellite capacity management.

**_Orderbook_**

The Group had a strong orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018. The Group’s orderbook as at 30 June
2018 consisted of £3.5 billion revenue contracted in the Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment,
£1.3 billion revenue contracted in the Telecoms & M2M reporting segment and £0.2 billion revenue
contracted in the Satellite & Media reporting segment, which accounted for 69.5%, 25.8% and 4.7% of the
total £5.0 billion revenue contracted, respectively. A significant proportion of the value of the Group’s
orderbook relates to medium to long-term contracts across all its business units, including DTT and radio
transmission, site sharing, energy and water smart metering, as well as satellite and other infrastructure
services. These contracts result in generally predictable revenue generation with significant visibility over
expected revenue for the financial year at the commencement of each financial year. Approximately 85.6%
of the Group’s actual revenues realised in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at
30 June 2017. In addition to these customer contracts, the Group’s strong orderbook also includes
arrangements with the major broadcasters and Ofcom to clear the 700 MHz spectrum and change requests
associated with the Group’s smart energy metering and the further roll-out of the smart water metering
network with Thames Water.

**_Revenue impact of disposals_**

As part of the Group’s increased focus on its core activities, the Group disposed of certain non-core and
sub-scale business across its business units throughout the period under review. This included the disposal
of the WiFi business in November 2016 (Telecoms & M2M), as well as the disposal of the Group’s Secure
Solutions assets and its payphone assets/business (NWP Street Limited) in July 2015 (Satellite & Media).
Revenue from the Group’s disposed businesses was £28.8 million, £7.2 million and nil for the years ended
30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, representing 3.3%, 0.8% and 0.0% of the Group’s total
revenues for the corresponding periods, respectively.

**_Impact of cost savings programmes_**

In the periods under review, the Group implemented a cost savings programme aimed at achieving
efficiencies and reducing costs by optimising the Group’s cost base and driving margin improvements by
reducing overhead, consolidating business units into a more efficient structure and other initiatives, which
(together with the change in the Group’s product mix described above) contributed to substantial EBITDA
growth. The Group’s company-wide ‘‘FutureFit’’ transformation programme aims to streamline processes,
modernise IT systems and achieve third-party cost efficiencies. The Group has conducted a review of

99


-----

operational processes across the business, underpinned by a transformation of IT systems, to deliver
improvements in operational efficiency, eliminate waste and deliver improvements in customer services.
Third-party savings achieved in the period under review include (i) IT cost savings, such as the
renegotiation of rates for systems maintenance and rationalisation of the supplier base; (ii) circuit cost
savings; (iii) facilities cost savings; (iv) power cost reductions, including the renegotiation of rates with
energy providers and reduction of energy consumption; (v) transmission cost savings, such as the reduction
in purchase of consumable and stock items through more efficient monitoring; (vi) reduction of travel
spend; (vii) reduction of the marketing function and restrictions on third party marketing spend; and
(viii) optimising satellite capacity. The Group intends to continue to focus on the delivery of further
efficiencies as it rolls out its improved systems and processes that, together with the natural conclusion of
major projects such as the 700 MHz clearance programme and the smart energy metering network, are
expected to result in a substantial reduction in headcount.

**_Seasonality_**

The Group’s working capital movement is seasonal in nature due to the different contractual timings of
receipts and payments. The Group invoices a proportion of its site share customers annually in advance,
and these billings and subsequent cash collections are mainly concentrated in the third quarter of the
financial year. In addition, annual staff bonus payments are made in the first quarter of the financial year.
As a result, the Group’s cash inflow from operations in the second half of the financial year has historically
been approximately double the amount of the first half of the financial year, which is reflected in the
working capital fluctuation. Consequently, working capital movements tend to be adverse in the first half
of the financial year as a higher proportion of profit and loss revenues are non-cash. This is reflected by the
large negative movement in creditors in the first half of the financial year and is mainly driven by negative
deferred income movements. Deferred income principally comprises (i) short term site share revenue
resulting from key customers paying yearly, half yearly, quarterly and monthly in advance, (ii) payments by
customers in advance outside their normal payment terms, (iii) site assignments from customers as part of
framework contract terms, and (iv) projects where cash is paid up front as costs (capital expenditure and
operational expenditure) are incurred but revenue is spread over the period of the contract, such as smart
metering change requests. See ‘‘—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Net cash flows—Working Capital’’.

**Description of Certain Income Statement Line Items**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the gross inflow of economic benefit for services provided utilising the Group’s
communications infrastructure, completion of significant engineering projects and the sale of

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses represent operating costs of the business that are not directly variable in line
with changes in revenue, such as staff costs not associated with the maintenance of customer contracts or
networks and the majority of corporate support costs. Such costs include the salaries and wages of
employees, licence and operating arrangement fees, sales and marketing costs, travel and consultancy fees.

**_Other income_**

Other income includes the gross inflow of economic benefit for services provided which do not qualify as
revenue. This includes certain government grants.

**_Share of results of associates and joint ventures_**

receivables relating to joint ventures as well as dividends received from investments.

**_Finance costs_**

Finance costs comprise the expense of servicing the Group’s financing arrangements, the amortisation of
any associated costs of putting such arrangements in place, as well as the unwinding of discounts on
provisions relating to matters such as decommissioning.

**_Other gains and losses_**

Other gains and losses represents fair value gains and losses under the Group’s hedging arrangements,
profits/losses on the sale of subsidiaries and exceptional gains/losses on the close out of swap arrangements
and the disposal of swap options. See ‘‘—Derivative Financial Instruments’’.

**_Tax_**

Tax represents the corporation tax charge on the Group’s profit or loss for the year, and includes both
current and deferred taxation. Current year tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the
year, using rates enacted or substantively enacted in each jurisdiction at the end of the reporting period,
and any adjustments in respect of previous periods.

_Terrestrial Broadcast_

Revenue for the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2018 was
£487.6 million, representing an 8.6% increase from £449.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This
increase has been delivered as a result of increased activity in relation to the 700 MHz clearance
programme, as well as increased activity from DAB following completion of the roll-out and RPI-linked
increases on broadcast contracts.

102


-----

_Telecoms & M2M_

Reported revenue for the Group’s Telecoms & M2M reporting segment was £341.3 million in the year
ended 30 June 2018, a 1.2% decrease from £345.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The year ended
30 June 2017 included revenues totalling £7.2 million (2018: £nil) from the WiFi business, which was
disposed of within that year. Excluding this disposal, revenue on a continuing basis was £341.3 million and
£338.2 million for the years ended 30 June 2018 and 2017, respectively, and organic revenue growth was
0.9%.

Organic revenue growth in the Group’s Telecoms & M2M reporting segment was principally a result of
increased revenue from the telecoms towers business (£220.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2018,
compared to £212.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2017) increasing 3.8% due to site assignments and
upgrades to existing sites, and contract indexation. This growth has been offset by a decrease in lower
margin Installation Services activity (£51.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2018, compared to
£68.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2017) in line with the expected programme roll-out.

M2M revenues increased to £63.2 million in the year ended 30 June 2018 from £50.4 million in the year
ended 30 June 2017. This was principally due to further revenues from set-up charges and change requests
relating to the Group’s smart energy metering network.

_Satellite & Media_

Revenue for the Satellite & Media reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2018 was
£133.5 million, which represented a 9.1% decrease from £146.9 million in the year ended 30 June 2017.
The decrease was driven by the continuing impact of exiting low margin contracts and rationalisation of
services. These decreases were, however, partially offset by the rollout of new HD channel sales within the
UK DTH business.

**_Cost of Sales_**

For the year ended 30 June 2018, cost of sales for the Group was £323.0 million, a decrease of 8.6% from
£353.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. Cost of sales from continuing operations (excluding the
WiFi business) decreased by 7.2%. The shift in sales mix towards higher margin activities and
improvements in service delivery efficiency has contributed to the reduction in cost of sales.

**_Gross profit_**

For the year ended 30 June 2018, gross profit for the Group was £639.4 million, representing an 8.8%
increase from £587.8 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. Gross profit from continuing operations
increased 9.1% year on year as a result of the abovementioned revenue growth and shift in sales mix, as
well as improvements in the efficiency of service delivery.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2018 excluding exceptional items
were £121.8 million, a 6.5% increase from £114.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The increase was
principally due to a shift in nature of activities as major programmes progress, reducing billable and capital
labour costs towards third party expense and one-offs, including consultancy costs.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA for the Group before exceptional items was £517.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2018,
representing a 9.3% increase from £473.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2017, explained by the increase
in gross profit resulting from the shift in sales mix and cost saving initiatives from the FutureFit
programme and operating efficiencies becoming embedded into the cost base of the business.

(1) Other refers to the Group’s corporate business unit, e.g. the Company’s finance, legal and IT services.

_Terrestrial Broadcast_

EBITDA for the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment for the year ended 30 June 2018 was
£360.8 million, representing a 9.5% increase from £329.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The
growth was mainly due to completion of the DAB roll-out and increased 700 MHz Clearance activities.

_Telecoms & M2M_

EBITDA for the Group’s Telecoms & M2M reporting segment for the year ended 30 June 2018 was
£178.1 million, a 14.8% increase from £155.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This was driven by
changes in sales mix, namely an increase in site share revenue offset by a reduction in lower margin
installation services activity, as well as increases in incremental change requests relating to the smart
metering contract.

_Satellite & Media_

EBITDA for the Satellite & Media reporting segment for the year ended 30 June 2018 was £33.8 million, a
3.4% decrease from £35.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The decrease was due to the revenue
reduction described above, partially offset by reduction of satellite capacity costs as a result of the
FutureFit savings programme, which resulted in margin improvement.

_Other_

EBITDA for the Group’s Other reporting segment for the year ended 30 June 2018 was £(55.2) million, a
20.0% decrease from £(46.0) million for the year ended 30 June 2017. The increase reflected increased
maintenance contract and licence costs to support IT systems in growth areas, including smart metering,
together with one-off costs, including consultancy costs and foreign exchange credits, in the year ended
30 June 2017 but not repeated in the year ended 30 June 2018.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2018 was £163.7 million, an increase of 15.6%
from £141.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This was due to an increase in the underlying tangible
asset base of the Group (particularly in connection with smart metering contracts and the 700 MHz
clearance programme) and the accelerated depreciation on certain assets (particularly in connection with
assets replaced under the 700 MHz clearance programme).

**_Amortisation_**

Amortisation for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2018 was £16.7 million, an increase of 32.5%
from £12.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This was due to an increase in the underlying intangible
asset base of the Group and the accelerated amortisation of certain assets linked to the Group’s IT
transformation.

104


-----

**_Impairment_**

Impairment for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2018 was £4.4 million, compared to £nil in the
year ended 30 June 2017. This increase was due to an impairment recognised in the year ended 30 June
2018 to write down the value of tangible and intangible assets in relation to non-core business areas.

**_Exceptional operating expenses_**

Exceptional operating expenses for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2018 were £9.5 million,
compared to £29.5 million during the year ended 30 June 2017. Exceptional items charged to operating
profit in both the year ended 30 June 2018 and the year ended 30 June 2017 predominantly related to
reorganisation and programme management resulting from the Group’s FutureFit efficiency programme
and costs associated with the shareholders’ strategic review. Year-on-year changes reflect the phasing of
the FutureFit programme.

**_EBITDA including exceptional items_**

EBITDA for the Group including exceptional items charged to operating profit was £508.9 million for the
year ended 30 June 2018, an increase of 14.4% compared with £444.0 million for the year ended 30 June
2017. This was explained by the increase in gross profit and operating efficiencies becoming embedded into
the cost base of the business.

**_Other income_**

Other income for the year ended 30 June 2018 was £4.6 million, a 318.2% increase from £1.1 million for
the year ended 30 June 2017, and related to income grants received in the year. In addition, on 26 October
2017, the Group sold its 22.5% shareholding in Arts Alliance Media Investment Limited, a joint venture. A
gain of £0.1 million was recognised on disposal.

**_Share of results of associates and joint ventures_**

The Group’s share of results of associates and joint ventures for the year ended 30 June 2018 was
£0.2 million compared to £0.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The prior year included a share of
adverse foreign exchange movements.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit for the Group was £328.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2018, a 12.7% increase from
£291.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This increase was principally due to the growth in EBITDA
described above, partially offset by the increases in operating expenses, depreciation, amortisation and
impairment.

**_Finance income_**

Finance income for the year ended 30 June 2018 was £2.0 million, compared to £3.7 million in the year
ended 30 June 2017. The decrease was principally due to one-off finance income generated on long-term
revenue contracts in the year ended 30 June 2017.

**_Bank and other loan interest_**

Bank and other loan interest for the Group was £228.8 million for the year ended 30 June 2018 compared
to £231.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. This decrease was as a result of the new facilities and
swap instruments that were established in November 2016 and a reduction in the Group’s term debt.

**_Other interest_**

Other interest for the Group was £39.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2018, compared to £33.9 million
in the year ended 30 June 2017. Other interest is primarily non-cash and principally includes the
amortisation of debt issue costs and imputed interest.

**_Interest payable to other group entities_**

Interest payable to other group entities for the Group was £102.6 million for the year ended 30 June 2018,
compared to £93.2 million in the year ended 30 June 2017. The increase was due to the additional interest
on outstanding balances.

**_Other gains and losses_**

Excluding exceptional other gains and losses, the Group reported £92.3 million of other gains in the year
ended 30 June 2018, compared to a loss of £112.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2017 as a result of
mark-to-market movements. Of the gains in the period, a £2.0 million gain was recognised in relation to
foreign exchange movements on foreign denominated debt instruments. The cross-currency swaps provide
an economic hedge to the Group’s US$ denominated debt. A further £90.3 million of gains were
recognised as a result of fair value movements of swaps, principally attributable to the servicing of
derivatives partially offset by changes in market yields and credit spreads.

**_Tax_**

Tax on loss on ordinary activities during the year ended 30 June 2018 was a credit of £227.8 million,
compared to a £0.1 million charge in the year ended 30 June 2017. The credit in the period was a result of
one-off tax adjustments, including recognition of deferred tax assets, not previously recognised on the
balance sheet following changes in tax legislation and payment received for group relief.

**_Profit for the financial year_**

The profit for the year ended 30 June 2018 was £283.3 million, compared to a loss of £196.9 million in the
year ended 30 June 2017. The profit for the period was after non-cash charges of £23.6 million (2017:
£413.4 million charge) comprising: £92.3 million credited to other gains and losses excluding exceptional
items (2017: £133.1 million charged); £163.7 million depreciation (2017: £141.6 million); £16.7 million
amortisation (2017: £12.6 million); £4.4 million impairment (2017: £nil); £102.6 million interest payable to
other group entities (2017: £93.2 million); £34.6 million of other non-cash interest and similar charges
(2017: £32.9 million); and £206.1 million credited to recognise deferred tax assets (2017: £nil). Excluding
these non-cash items, the Group made an adjusted profit of £306.9 million in the year ended 30 June 2018,
compared to an adjusted profit of £216.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2017.

**Financial Year Ended 30 June 2017 Compared to the Financial Year Ended 30 June 2016**

**_Revenue_**

For the year ended 30 June 2017 revenue for the Group was £941.3 million, an increase of 6.5% from
£884.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The year ended 30 June 2016 included revenue totalling
£28.8 million (compared to £7.2 million for the year ended 30 June 2017) from non-core business areas
(principally the WiFi and Secure Solutions businesses in the Telecoms & M2M business segment), that
were disposed of in the years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016, respectively. Excluding these disposals,
revenue growth from continuing operations was 9.2%.

_Terrestrial Broadcast_

Revenue for the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£449.0 million, representing a 6.3% increase from £422.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This
increase was principally from the Group’s DTT multiplexes (2017: £175.8 million; 2016: £168.3 million)
mainly as a result of new channel launches and other increases. The Group had capacity of 31 video
streams on its main multiplexes, all of which were utilised and increased channel sales on its DVB-T2 (HD
enabled) multiplexes during the financial year. Radio contracts (resulting from the DAB roll-out and
increased transmission activity thereon), an increase in activities in relation to the 700 MHz clearance
programme, and RPI linked increases on broadcast contracts delivered further growth.

_Telecoms & M2M_

Revenue for the Group’s Telecoms & M2M reporting segment was £345.4 million in the year ended
30 June 2017, a 9.0% increase from £317.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The year ended 30 June
2016 included revenues totalling £28.8 million (compared to £7.2 million in the year ended 30 June 2017)
from non-core business areas (principally the WiFi and Secure Solutions businesses) which were disposed
of. Excluding these disposals, revenue on a continuing basis was £338.2 million and £288.2 million for the
years ended 30 June 2017 and 2016, respectively, and organic revenue growth was 17.3%.

The organic growth was principally as a result of increased revenue from the telecoms towers business
(£212.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2017 and £198.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2016) due to
site assignments and upgrades to existing sites, and accelerations in Installation Services activity
(£68.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2017 and £51.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2016) to assist
MNOs in meeting 4G coverage requirements.

M2M revenues increased to £50.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2017 from £34.4 million in the year
ended 30 June 2016. This was principally due to recurring smart energy metering contract revenues as a
result of network availability charges commencing in December 2015, further revenues from change
requests to the smart energy metering contract, and additional meter revenues in relation to smart
metering contracts with Thames Water and Anglian Water.

_Satellite & Media_

Revenue for the Satellite & Media reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£146.9 million which was a 1.6% increase from £144.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The growth
was driven by new HD channel sales, its new agreement with Al Jazeera Media Network for global teleport
and distribution services, and foreign exchange gains. These increases were, however, partially offset by the
continuing impact of exiting certain low margin contracts.

**_Cost of Sales_**

For the year ended 30 June 2017 cost of sales for the Group was £353.5 million, an increase of 2.9% from
£343.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. Cost of sales from continuing operations increased by 8.1%
over the same period. The percentage increase in cost of sales was lower than the increase in revenue
primarily due to the shift in sales mix (i.e. disposal of non-core business areas) and improvements in the
efficiency of service delivery.

**_Gross profit_**

For the year ended 30 June 2017, gross profit for the Group was £587.8 million, representing an 8.8%
increase from £540.5 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. Gross profit from continuing operations
increased 10.5% year on year as a result of the above-mentioned strong revenue growth and improvements
in the efficiency of service delivery.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2017, excluding exceptional items,
were £114.4 million, a 1.9% increase from £112.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The increase was
principally due to higher rewards and bonuses under management and employee performance frameworks
due to the business outperforming expectations. Additionally, there were adverse movements in foreign
exchange versus favourable movements recorded in the prior year.

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA for the Group before exceptional items was £473.5 million for the year ended 30 June 2017,
representing a 10.5% increase from £428.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2016, explained by the
increase in gross profit and the business outperforming business expectations. The outperformance of the
business was primarily attributable to cost saving initiatives and operating efficiencies and will become
embedded into the cost base for future financial periods. This was partially offset by the marginal increase
in other operating expenses as set out above.

The following table shows the Group’s EBITDA (pre-exceptional items) by reporting segment for the
years indicated:

_Terrestrial Broadcast_

EBITDA for the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£329.4 million, representing a 6.9% increase from £308.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The
growth was mainly due to utilisation of the main multiplexes with increased capacity, on-going DAB
roll-out and 700 MHz Clearance activities.

_Telecoms & M2M_

EBITDA for the Group’s Telecoms & M2M reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£155.1 million, a 16.0% increase from £133.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This was principally
due to the growth in the telecoms towers business, and the smart energy metering contract, which were
among the main sources of revenue growth.

_Satellite and Media_

EBITDA for the Satellite & Media reporting segment during the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£35.0 million which represented an 11.8% increase from £31.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The
revenue growth of 1.6% as described above has been further supported by rationalisation of satellite
capacity costs and headcount savings.

_Other_

The increase in Other costs versus the prior year period was mainly driven by movements in foreign
exchange partially offset by reductions in corporate costs.

**_Depreciation_**

Depreciation for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2017 was £141.6 million, an increase of 10.3%
from £128.4 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This was due to an increase in the underlying tangible
asset base of the Group (particularly in connection with Smart Metering contracts) and the accelerated
depreciation on certain assets (particularly in connection with the 700 MHz clearance programme).

**_Amortisation_**

Amortisation for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2017 was £12.6 million, an increase of 22.3%
from £10.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This was due to an increase in the underlying intangible

108


-----

asset base of the Group, and the accelerated amortisation of certain assets linked to the Group’s IT
transformation

**_Exceptional operating expenses_**

Exceptional operating expenses for the Group during the year ended 30 June 2017 were £29.5 million
compared to £13.6 million during the year ended 30 June 2016, an increase of 116.9%. Exceptional items
charged to operating profit in both the year ended 30 June 2017 and 2016 predominantly relate to
reorganisation costs; in the year ended 30 June 2017 resulting from the Group’s new FutureFit efficiency
programme.

**_EBITDA including exceptional items_**

EBITDA for the Group including exceptional items charged to operating profit was £444.0 million for the
year ended 30 June 2017, an increase of 7.04% compared with £414.8 million in the year ended 30 June
2016.

**_Other income_**

Other income for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £1.1 million (compared to £0.2 million for the year
ended 30 June 2016) and related to income grants received in the year.

**_Share of results of associates and joint ventures_**

The Group’s share of results of associates and joint ventures for the year ended 30 June 2017 was
£0.3 million compared to £0.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The year ended 30 June 2016
included a share of adverse foreign exchange movements.

**_Operating profit_**

For the year ended 30 June 2017, operating profit for the Group was £291.1 million, representing a 5.4%
increase from £276.2 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This increase was principally due to the
growth in EBITDA including exceptional items described above, partially offset by the increase in
depreciation and amortisation.

**_Finance income_**

Finance income for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £3.7 million compared to £1.3 million in the year
ended 30 June 2016. The increase was principally due to finance income generated on long-term revenue
contracts.

**_Bank and other loan interest_**

Bank and other loan interest for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £231.4 million compared
to £225.1 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. This increase was as a result of the higher rates and
phasing of the new swap instruments that were restructured as part of the November 2016 refinancing, and
the annual margin step-up on the Group’s former bank facilities prior to refinancing.

**_Other interest_**

Other interest for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £33.9 million, compared to £32.5 million
in the year ended 30 June 2016. Other interest was primarily non-cash and principally includes the
amortisation of debt issue costs and imputed interest.

**_Interest payable to other group entities_**

Interest payable to other group entities for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £93.2 million,
compared to £84.6 million in the year ended 30 June 2016. The increase was due to the additional interest
on higher interest accrued and outstanding balances.

**_Other gains and losses_**

The Group reported £112.5 million of other losses in the year ended 30 June 2017, compared to
£0.1 million of other losses in the year ended 30 June 2016. Of the losses in the year ended 30 June 2017,

109


-----

£104.2 million were as a result of movements in the fair value of swaps. This loss was principally
attributable to changes in market yields and credit spreads. An £8.3 million loss was recognised in relation
to foreign exchange movements on foreign denominated debt instruments, however the cross-currency
swaps provide an economic hedge to the Group’s US dollar denominated debt.

**_Exceptional other gains and losses_**

Exceptional other gains and losses included the close out of swap arrangements as part of the Group’s
November 2016 refinancing (£15.4 million) and a loss on disposal of Arqiva WiFi Limited in November
2016 (£5.2 million).

**_Tax_**

Tax on loss on ordinary activities during the year ended 30 June 2017 was a £0.1 million charge, compared
to a £0.1 million credit in the year ended 30 June 2016.

**_Loss for the financial year_**

The loss for the year ended 30 June 2017 was £196.9 million, compared to a loss of £50.3 million in the year
ended 30 June 2016. The loss in the year ended 30 June 2017 was principally as a result of the adverse fair
value movements recorded in respect of the swaps as described above. The loss for the period was after
non-cash charges of £413.4 million (compared to a £240.5 million charge in the year ended 30 June 2016)
comprising: £133.1 million charged to other gains and losses (compared to £14.3 million credited in the
year ended 30 June 2016); £141.6 million depreciation (compared to £128.4 million in the year ended
30 June 2016); £12.6 million amortisation (compared to £10.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2016);
£93.2 million interest payable to other group entities (compared to £84.6 million in the year ended 30 June
2016); and £32.9 million of other non-cash interest and similar charges (compared to £31.5 million in the
year ended 30 June 2016). Excluding these non-cash items, the Group made a profit of £216.5 million in
the year ended 30 June 2017 compared to an adjusted profit of £190.2 million in the year ended 30 June
2016.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

The Group’s primary source of liquidity for its operations and capital expenditures has historically been
positive cash flow from operations, internal liquidity and banking facilities. Following the Transactions, the
Group believes it will have adequate and stable sources of funds to meet its future capital expenditures and
working capital requirements.

_Net cash inflow from operating activities_

For the year ended 30 June 2018, the Group generated a cash inflow from operating activities of
£572.1 million compared to £489.7 million for the year ended 30 June 2017, representing a 16.8% increase
from the prior year due to strong EBITDA performance and working capital inflows.

For the year ended 30 June 2017, the Group generated a cash inflow from operating activities of
£489.7 million compared to £365.9 million in the year ended 30 June 2016, representing a 33.8% increase
from the prior year due to strong EBITDA and positive working capital. This was partially offset by an
increase in exceptionals driven by the compensation payments for alignment in contract terms and
conditions. Operating cash flow after capital and financial investment activities (which aggregates cash
inflow from operating activities and net capital expenditure and financial investment) was £351.6 million in
the year ended 30 June 2017 compared to £219.0 million in the year ended 30 June 2016, representing an
improvement of £132.6 million. This improvement resulted in the Group repaying more borrowings during
the year compared with the prior year.

_Working capital_

Working capital is part of ‘‘Net cash inflow from operating activities’’ in the Group’s summary consolidated
cash flow statement. The Group defines working capital movement as the movement in current assets,
current liabilities and certain long term liabilities including deferred income and provisions greater than
one year that form part of the Group’s net cash inflow from operating activities. Working capital
movement does not include other statement of financial position item movements such as capital creditors,
imputed interest and movements on intercompany loan and interest balances.

Whilst the Group’s business is not seasonal in nature, its working capital movement is seasonal. The Group
invoices and collects a proportion of its Site Share revenues annually in advance in the third quarter of the
year. Annual staff bonus payments are made in the first quarter of the financial year.

The table below sets out the Group’s working capital position as at the dates shown:

**Year Ended 30 June**
**2016** **2017** **2018**
**(£ millions)**
Net (increase) / decrease in receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (50.2) (4.3) 5.9
Net (decrease) / increase in payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (2.1) 36.9 70.7
Net increase / (decrease) in provisions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3.1 13.1 (12.6)

**Total working capital movement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(49.2)** **45.7** **64.0**

The components of the Group’s working capital are:

- Net movement in receivables comprising trade receivables, prepayments and accrued revenue;

- Net movement in payables including trade payables, sundry payables, VAT creditors, accruals, and
deferred revenue less than and greater than one year; and

- Net movement in provisions includes provisions less than and greater than one year.

The working capital movement for the year ended 30 June 2018 was an inflow of £64.0 million, compared
to an inflow of £45.7 million in the year ended 30 June 2017 and an outflow of £49.2 million in the year
ended 30 June 2016.

The year ended 30 June 2018 working capital inflow of £64.0 million consisted of:

- A decrease in receivables of £5.9 million as a result of timing differences in billing and cash collection
mostly from large Telecoms & M2M and Terrestrial Broadcast customers;

- A net increase in payables of £70.7 million which is principally due to additional deferred income
recognised from Telecoms & M2M and Terrestrial Broadcast customers, partially offset by the normal
utilisation of deferred revenue in connection with large Telecoms & M2M customers; and

- A net decrease in provisions of £12.6 million principally following the payment of compensation for
the alignment of employee contract terms and conditions.

111


-----

The movement in working capital compared to the year ended 30 June 2017 is a favourable movement of
£18.3 million. This was principally due to additional deferred income recognised partially offset by the
payment of compensation for the alignment of employee contract terms and conditions.

The year ended 30 June 2017 working capital inflow of £45.7 million consisted of:

- An increase in receivables of £4.3 million as a result of partially offsetting timing differences in billing
and cash collection mostly from large Telecoms and Terrestrial Broadcast customers;

- A net increase in payables of £36.9 million which was principally due to: additional deferred income
recognition in relation to smart metering resulting from an advance receipt as a result of a new change
request order, 700 MHz Clearance and other Telecoms and Terrestrial Broadcast customers;
additional central accruals including performance related staff benefits; partially offset by the normal
utilisation of deferred revenue in connection with large Telecoms customers and other smaller timing
differences; and

- A net increase in provisions of £13.1 million primarily due to exceptional expenditure in relation to
reorganisation costs including compensation payments for the alignment of contract terms and
conditions.

The movement in working capital compared to the year ended 30 June 2016 was a favourable movement of
£94.9 million. This was principally due to additional deferred income from advance cash receipts
recognised in the current period in relation to an improved working capital position on certain contracts,
including Smart Metering and 700 MHz Clearance.

The year ended 30 June 2016 working capital outflow of £49.2 million consisted of:

- An increase in receivables of £50.2 million which is principally due to:

  - An increase in trade receivables primarily due to the timing of receipts from certain large
customers;

  - Grant receipt claims assessed in respect of the finalisation of the mobile infrastructure project
(‘MIP’), shown within sundry debtors;

  - Other smaller timing differences in relation to the timing of receipts from customers and
prepayments on corporate contracts.

- A decrease in payables of £2.1 million which is principally due the normal utilisation of deferred
revenue in connection with large Terrestrial Broadcast and Telecoms customers partially offset by an
increase in deferred revenue in connection with the Group’s smart energy metering contract and
future grant claims (as described above), among other smaller timing differences.

- A net increase in provisions of £3.1 million primarily due to exceptional expenditure in relation to
reorganisation and severance costs.

_Net capital expenditure and financial investment_

The Group requires maintenance capital expenditure as well as growth capital expenditure to support its
current business and future development. The Group expects its capital expenditures to reduce over the
longer term as major projects complete, with reduction starting from the year ending 30 June 2019

Maintenance capital expenditure is expenditure that is incurred to deliver cost-savings, productivity
enhancements, to extend the useful life of existing non-current assets, or replace worn out and obsolete
non-current assets with new ones in order to support existing contracts; ‘Growth—contracted’ is capital
expenditure that is incurred to deliver new or renewal revenues and which is supported by a signed
customer contract; ‘Growth—non-contracted’ is capital expenditure that is incurred to deliver revenues
and which is supported by a business case but on which there is no signed customer contract at the time at
which expenditure is incurred and reported.

Capital creditors/accruals reflect the timing difference (between accruing the liability for capital
expenditure and the associated cash outflow) to arrive at ‘net capital expenditure and financial investment’.

(1) Sale of non-current assets related to the disposal of assets in non-core business areas.

(2) Reflects the timing difference (between accruing the liability for capital expenditure and the associated cash outflow) to arrive
at ‘net capital expenditure and financial investment’.

For the year ended 30 June 2018, net cash capital expenditure and financial investment was £164.8 million,
compared to £161.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2017.

The overall increase in net capital expenditure and financial investment in the year ended 30 June 2018
compared with the year ended 30 June 2017 was principally a result of the increased expenditure on
significant capital projects, including the 700 MHz clearance programme, partly offset by the change in
capital creditors and accruals due to short term cash flow timing.

Included within the £121.7 million ‘growth—contracted’ capital expenditure in the year ended 30 June
2018 was:

- £64.6 million within Terrestrial Broadcast, principally in relation to the 700 MHz clearance
programme and DAB roll-out;

- £44.8 million within Telecoms & M2M, principally in relation to the smart energy metering contract;

- £9.3 million within Satellite & Media across a number of projects; and

- £3.0 million relating to central corporate functions.

For the year ended 30 June 2017, net cash capital expenditure and financial investment was £161.3 million,
compared to £163.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2016.

Net capital expenditure and financial investment remained consistent for the year ended 30 June 2017
compared with the year ended 30 June 2016.

Included within the £129.5 million ‘growth—contracted’ capital expenditure in the year ended 30 June
2017 was:

- £66.2 million within Telecoms & M2M, principally in relation to the smart energy metering contract;

- £51.0 million within Terrestrial Broadcast, principally in relation to the 700 MHz clearance
programme and DAB roll-out;

- £9.3 million within Satellite & Media across a number of projects; and

- £3.0 million relating to central corporate functions.

The 28GHz licence acquisition was spectrum that has been purchased to be used across London boroughs
for 5G connectivity.

The figures set out by operating segment above are presented on an accruals basis and therefore cannot be
directly reconciled to the figures presented as segmental information in the notes to the financial
statements, which are presented on a cash basis.

(3) Reflects the debt to be refinanced by the issuance of the Notes. See ‘‘Use of Proceeds’’.

As part of the Group’s 2013 refinancing, the majority of the balances within amounts owed to group
undertakings were formalised under a single subordinated loan agreement with the direct parent company
which has a long term maturity date of 2033. Under the terms of the subordinated loan agreement, these
loans cannot be recalled earlier than the final maturity date other than with the agreement of the
borrower, and interest can be deferred if the borrower does not have sufficient available cash flow. The
Group continues to defer these amounts in accordance with the terms of the loans, and this deferred
amount is presented as being due within one year.

The Group does not, and has not used off-balance sheet special purpose vehicles or similar financing
arrangements on an historical basis. In addition, the Group has not had and does not have off-balance
sheet arrangements with any of its affiliates.

**Contingent Liabilities**

For a discussion of the Group’s contingent liabilities, see Note 28 of the Group’s consolidated financial
information and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

The Group has not used special purpose vehicles or similar financing arrangements on an historical basis.
In addition, the Group has not had and does not have off-balance sheet arrangements with any of its
affiliates.

**Derivative Financial Instruments**

The Group uses interest rate swaps and inflation linked swaps to hedge its net exposure to movements in
interest rates and inflation and cross-currency swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations of currency
movements on its foreign dominated debt. Receipts, payments and accreting liabilities on interest rate and

114


-----

inflation swaps are recognised on an accruals basis, as part of the carrying value of the instrument over its
full life, which correlates to the life of the instrument it is designed to hedge.

Amounts received and paid under the swaps are shown at net value under financing costs, where they are
part of the same legal agreement and settled at net value in practice. Accreting liabilities on inflation
linked swaps are incorporated into the fair value measurement of the instrument.

The Group also utilises forward contracts to hedge certain trade-related foreign currency transactions,
however there were no trades in place as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

The fair value of derivatives is calculated using a credit risk-adjusted discount rate and therefore
incorporates a debit valuation adjustment (and/or credit valuation adjustment) as required. The changes in
the fair value of such derivatives are recognised within the income statement as an ‘‘other gain or loss’’.

For a description of the Group’s hedging arrangements, see ‘‘Overview of Senior Hedges’’.

_Inflation Linked Swaps_

As at 30 June 2018, £1,312.5 million of fixed rate debt was hedged via three classes of inflation linked
swaps which either directly or via overlay swaps, fix interest and cause it to be indexed to RPI. These swaps
have been structured such that the accretion is paid down annually. For the years ended 30 June 2018, 2017
and 2016 the accretion cash payments were £26.0 million, £53.4 million and £58.6 million, respectively.
Variation in the accretion cash payments is due to changes in RPI over the relevant periods. Only one
small tranche of these swaps has a mandatory break clause in 2023, whilst the remaining tranches are
break-free.

The maturity date for all three classes of inflation linked swaps is April 2027. See ‘‘Overview of Senior
_Hedges—Senior Borrower ILS and Senior Borrower OS’’._

_Interest Rate Swaps_

As at 30 June 2018, £976.5 million of floating rate debt was hedged via four tranches of interest rate swaps
contracted by Arqiva Financing No1 Ltd. These swaps have no break clauses and maturity dates are
aligned with the underlying floating rate debt instrument’s repayment profile. See ‘‘Overview of Senior
_Hedges—Senior Borrower IRS’’._

_Cross-Currency Swaps_

Arqiva Financing No 1 Ltd entered into US$358.0 million of cross-currency swaps to fix the Sterling cost of
future interest and capital repayment obligations relating to the US dollar tranche of the Private
Placement at an exchange rate of US$1.52:£1. See ‘‘Overview of Senior Hedges—Senior Borrower CCS’’.

_Swap Options_

Following their close-out in November 2016, the Group no longer holds any swap options. As at 30 June
2016, these amounted to £353.2 million notional principal.

_Fair value measurement_

The credit risk-adjusted fair value of the Group’s outstanding swaps at 30 June 2018 was a liability of
£1,030.8 million, comprising £755.1 million in relation to the Group’s inflation linked swaps (including
principal accretion of £nil), £297.7 million in relation to the Group’s interest rate swaps and a £22.0 million
asset in relation to the Group’s cross-currency swaps.

**Pension Obligations**

The Group currently operates two pension arrangements. The Group operates a defined contribution
group personal pension scheme for employees employed in the UK to which the relevant employer makes
contributions of between 6% and 10% depending on the employee’s level of contributions. The Group also
operates a defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new entrants and was closed to future accrual
with effect from 31 January 2016. As at 30 June 2017 (latest valuation) the defined benefit pension scheme
had approximately 847 active members, 439 deferred members and 435 pensioner and dependant
members. The defined benefit pension scheme was closed to future accrual from 31 January 2016, meaning
that active members then became deferred or pensioner members. As part of the transitional

115


-----

arrangements for closure, payments are being made to former members of the defined benefit pension
scheme of between 50% and 65% of pensionable salary over the next two to five years. The draft valuation
for 30 June 2017 (latest valuation) indicates a deficit of £18.3 million on an ongoing (technical provisions)
basis, representing a funding level of 93% (technical provisions basis) and the cost of buying out the
members’ benefits in the defined benefit pension scheme would have been around £112.6 million. The
proposed schedule of contributions requires Arqiva Limited to make annual contributions in respect of the
defined benefit pension scheme deficit of between £5.4 million and £5.9 million until 2020. A small number
of employees (estimated to be less than 100) have entitlements to enhanced early retirement benefits
under the defined benefit pension scheme which would transfer on any future TUPE transfer.

**Market Risk Disclosure**

The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in price,
credit risk, liquidity risk, cash flow interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The Group’s overall risk
management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects as noted below.

**_Purchase price risk_**

Energy is a major component of the Group’s cost base and is subject to price volatility. A large proportion
of this is managed via pass-through arrangements to customers. The Group’s residual exposure to
fluctuations in the electricity price is managed by forward purchasing the majority of power requirements.
Key revenue and cost milestones are set on larger projects to ensure the financial risks of volatile market
pricing are mitigated.

**_Credit risk_**

The Group is exposed to credit risk on customer receivables. This is managed through appropriate credit
checking procedures prior to taking on new customers; and higher risk customers paying in advance of
services being provided. Performance is closely monitored to ensure agreed service levels are maintained,
reducing the level of queried payments and mitigating the risk of uncollectible debts.

The Group is exposed to counterparty risks in its financing operations. The Group carefully manages the
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a
range of major financial institutions which have satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit
rating agencies. The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Group’s on-going risk management
processes, which include a regular review of the credit ratings. Risk in this area is limited further by setting
a maximum level and term for deposits with any single counterparty. For details of the Group’s debt
maturity profile, see ‘‘—Contractual Obligations and Commitments’’ above.

**_Liquidity risk_**

To provide the Group with sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth,
the Group maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast
requirements. As at 30 June 2018 the Group had £39 million cash and £335 million available undrawn
facilities to meet planned growth and working capital requirements. In addition, the Group has
£250.0 million of liquidity facilities available to cover senior interest payments if required. The Board of
Directors considers the availability and adequacy of working capital funding requirements in conjunction
with forming its long-term financial plan for the business.

**_Financing risk_**

The Group will need to refinance at least part of its debt as it matures and may need additional financing
to cover capital expenditure and certain other expenses to support its growth plans. The Group cannot be
certain that such financing will be readily available on attractive or historically comparable terms.

The Group attempts to mitigate this risk by the strength of the stable long term investment grade capital
structure in place, the Group’s BBB ratings reflect its strong ability to service and repay debt from cash
flows over a reasonable period of time, maintaining an active dialogue with lenders and investors,
maintaining debt with a variety of medium and long term maturities so that over time the Group does not
have a significant concentration of debt due for refinancing in any given year, and aiming to refinance debt
well in advance of the maturity date.

116


-----

In addition, if the Group breaches its debt covenants and/or if the Group’s ratings are downgraded, these
could impact the availability of finance or the comparability of terms. The Group monitors and models its
covenants, both retrospectively and prospectively, and maintains regular dialogue with credit ratings
agencies.

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group has exposure to interest rate risk due to borrowing variable rate bank debt. The Group uses
derivative contracts to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates. The Group maintains a hedging policy to
manage interest rate risk and to ensure the certainty of future interest cash flows and compliance with debt
covenants. It currently has fixed rate hedging, split between interest rate swaps and inflation-linked swaps.
Interest rate swaps convert variable rate interest costs to fixed rate interest costs while inflation swaps
convert fixed rate interest costs to RPI-linked costs, which fluctuate in line with the RPI index as do a
significant proportion of the Group’s revenue contracts. Fluctuations in interest rates therefore have had a
significant non-cash impact on the Group’s results of operations. Details of the interest rate profile of the
Group’s liabilities are provided in Note 25 to the Group’s Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**_Inflation risk_**

The Group has exposure to movements in inflation rates as a result of non-cash changes in the fair value of
the Group’s inflation-linked swaps, mitigated to some extent by inflation-linked revenue provisions in its
contracts.

**_Foreign exchange risk_**

The Group operates from UK sites and predominantly in the UK market. While some customer and
supplier contracts are denominated in other currencies (mainly US dollars and Euros), the majority of the
Group’s revenues and costs are sterling based, and accordingly exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited.
Management regularly monitor the impact of foreign exchange risks and assess the need to put any
mitigating financial instruments in place. During the periods presented in this financial information cross
currency swaps were in place to fix the exchange rate in relation to US Dollar denominated private
placement notes and senior bonds. Details of cross currency swaps are provided in Note 25 to the Group’s
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

For a description of the Group’s accounting policies, see Note 3 to the Group’s Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies the Directors are required to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other
factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

The following are the critical judgements, and those involving estimations, that the Directors have made in
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in the financial information. For a full description of critical accounting judgements
and key sources of estimation uncertainty, please see Note 4 to the Group’s Financial Statements included
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_Revenue recognition (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

In applying the Group’s revenue recognition policy, judgements are made in respect of certain areas
including:

- determination of distinct contract components and performance obligations;

- measurement of variable consideration;

117


-----

- determination of fair value of non-cash consideration; and

- the recognition of a significant financing component.

Such judgments are consistently applied across similar contracts and key estimates are regularly monitored
throughout the relevant contractual periods with reference to the stage of completion and any applicable
customer milestone acceptance. This is particularly relevant to the approach for significant engineering
projects which typically contain a programme build phase and a long-term operational phase.

**_Deferred tax (critical accounting judgement)_**

The largest element of deferred tax that requires judgement relates to tax losses carried forward.
Applicable accounting standards permit the recognition of deferred tax assets only to the extent that future
taxable profits will be generated to utilise the tax losses carried forward. The assessment of future taxable
profits involves significant estimation uncertainty, principally relating to an assessment of management’s
projections of future taxable income based on business plans and on-going tax planning strategies in
relation to substantively enacted tax legislation.

**_Useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangibles (key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires estimation. Depreciation or
amortisation is charged to the income statement based upon the useful lives selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will derive benefit from these assets.

The Group manages its property, plant and equipment on a portfolio basis through a central estates team.
This team contains qualified surveyors who have a wealth of experience working for the Group and within
the industry as a whole.

**_Provisions and contingent liabilities (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

The Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising from contractual obligations, restructuring
and property remediation plans and decommissioning obligations.

Estimates have been made in respect of the probable future obligations of the Group. These estimates are
reviewed annually to reflect current economic conditions and strategic plans.

Management exercises judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities through assessing
the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise, and in quantifying the possible range of financial
outcomes.

**_Impairment of goodwill (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill is reviewed at each statement of financial position date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment, in compliance with the Group’s accounting
policies. Deciding the recoverable amount of a line of business to which goodwill is attributed involves
management estimates. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the
value in use.

The Group determines these values using methods based on discounted cash flows. These discounted cash
flows are founded on five-year projections built on financial plans approved by the Board of Directors. The
cash flow projections take account of past experience, and are based on management’s best estimates of
future developments based on contracted growth and necessary expenditure to maintain the assets
required to generate that expected revenue. Cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using
an expected terminal growth rate.

The key assumptions underlying the changes in value in use involve estimates of the discount rate (with
reference to weighted average costs of capital), projected cash flows and terminal growth rate.

**_Actuarial assumptions used to determine the carrying amount of the Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities_**
**_(key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

The Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities are discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the
end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is required when
setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The
most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds,

118


-----

quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The Group selects these
assumptions in consultation with an external qualified actuary. Additionally, the present value of the
scheme liabilities depend on such factors as the life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of
the Group’s current employees and price inflation.

Estimates are used for all of these factors in determining the pension costs and liabilities incorporated in
the Group’s consolidated financial information. The assumptions reflect historical experience and the
Group’s judgement regarding future expectations.

**_Fair value measurements and valuation processes (key source of estimation uncertainty)_**

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is
available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses estimation techniques in accordance with
the requirements of IFRS 13. This includes the assessment of the fair value adjustments with respect to
credit risk (specifically debit valuation adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities) for which
the Group incorporates market-observable data into its valuation techniques.

**Recent and Prospective Changes in Accounting Policies**

IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 will be effective for the Group for the year ending 30 June 2019. The Group has
performed an impact assessment on the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 and does not expect either of
IFRS 9 or IFRS 15 to have a material impact on the financial statements. IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for
financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and is expected to have a material impact on the
financial statements of the Group for the year ending 30 June 2020. This is primarily through the
recognition of the Group’s operating leases on the balance sheet and reclassification of costs in the income
statement leading to an increase in EBITDA; however management is still assessing the impact of
adoption on the Group. Further details of the Group’s operating lease commitments are shown in Note 28
to the Group’s Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Introduction**

The Group operates within the UK broadcast, media and communication sectors, particularly within the
television, radio, fixed and wireless telecom and satellite and media management industries. The Group is
the UK’s pre-eminent national provider of terrestrial television and radio broadcast infrastructure and a
leading independent provider of communications infrastructure to mobile network operators (MNOs) in
the UK. The Group operates in the following areas:

- **_Terrestrial Broadcast (representing 51% of the Group’s total revenue in the year ended 30 June 2018),_**
comprising TV and radio transmission infrastructure and the operation of Multiplexes;

- **_Telecoms_** _(representing 29% of the Group’s total revenue in the year ended 30 June 2018), comprising_
infrastructure for wireless telecoms, small cells and distributed antenna systems (DAS);

- **_M2M (representing 7% of the Group’s total revenue in the year ended 30 June 2018), comprising smart_**
metering communications for electricity, gas and water and other machine-to-machine (M2M)
connectivity services; and

- **_Satellite & Media_** _(representing 14% of the Group’s total revenue in the year ended 30 June 2018),_
comprising UK-located teleports and media management centres, as well as an international network
of leased satellite and fibre infrastructure.

**The Television and Broadcast Industry in the UK**

The UK television market offers a broad choice of channels available to viewers on both free-to-air (FTA)
television and pay-television platforms. Television delivery platforms are the means of linking channels to
their audiences. Broadcasters select platforms to air their channels, with platform selection driven by the
commercial incentive to maximise revenues or to meet public service obligations.

The Group’s Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) platform is the largest TV platform in the UK with near
universal coverage of 98.5% and with approximately 18.9 million households using the services out of the
total approximately 27.1 million households in the UK with at least one active TV set irrespective of the
platform used as at 31 March 2018 (Source: BARB). The Group believes that DTT has a long-term future
as it provides near-universal coverage, a strong content offering and an economic model for FTA
broadcasters. In addition, unlike other platforms, DTT is free at the point of use. As such, the Group
believes that it will remain a popular TV platform with an established viewer base across UK households.
The Group expects DTT to continue to be complemented, but not replaced by, certain over-the-top (OTT)
services. The Group believes that there will remain a long-term need for FTA linear TV available to the
UK population, given that (i) FTA linear TV plays an important role in the Public Service Broadcasting
(PSB) system in the UK, including for the BBC, (ii) FTA linear TV provides unparalleled access to
channels to the television advertising market, (iii) approximately 11.6 million households rely on DTT as
their primary delivery mechanism for television broadcast services and (iv) approximately 40% of UK
households have disposable income of £21,000 or less and value access to a free service. The Group
believes that the DTT platform, as complemented by OTT services which can include catch-up TV and
subscription video-on-demand (VoD) services, is best placed to deliver this. In addition, the Group expects

120


-----

that any political agendas which could force voters to adopt paid-for alternatives are likely to be
unpopular.

TV homes that have DTT as their primarily delivery mechanism, rather than cable or satellite, make up the
largest proportion of all homes at approximately 42.9%. The proportion of homes with pay-DTH satellite
has fallen over time and digital cable has only seen marginal growth in uptake in recent years. Free-to-view
satellite services such as Freesat account for only a small proportion of all homes.

**_UK Television Delivery Platforms_**

Platforms comprise a transmission network (such as terrestrial broadcast sites, satellite, cable or telecom
networks) and an associated receiver, which may be integrated within the television set or may exist as a
separate ‘‘set-top box’’. The TV or set-top box allows users to search, receive and decode the channels and
programmes they wish to watch. More advanced receivers allow users to record programmes on to a
personal video recorder or connect to the internet.

Platforms can be divided into FTA platforms and pay platforms. The FTA platforms in the UK are
operated primarily by the Freeview and Freesat consortiums (as well as Freesat from Sky and Youview),
providing TV services that are free to the viewer at the point of consumption and provided through
advertising or licence fee payments, while pay television platforms are run on a proprietary commercial
basis (key providers include Sky, Virgin Media, BT TV and TalkTalk TV) and require payment to receive
the services.

The following chart shows the various television delivery platforms available in the UK:

_Digital Terrestrial Television—Freeview_

The DTT platform is principally used to provide FTA services marketed under the Freeview brand.
Freeview is backed by five shareholders: BBC, Sky, Channel 4, ITV and Arqiva. Freeview carries a range of
PSB channels, FTA channels, shopping channels, digital radio stations and interactive services to
households via an aerial.

DTT is the TV platform which covers the largest number of households in the UK, having an installed base
of approximately 18.9 million households, including approximately 11.6 million sets with DTT as the
primary TV platform in the household (Source: BARB). All new TV sets in the UK have a default DTT
tuner. DTT also offers a wide choice of popular content. In the week commencing 23 July 2018, all 50 of
the UK’s 50 most watched programmes were on FTA DTT channels (Source: Thinkbox). HD services have
been available on Freeview since 2010.

The number of channels on the Freeview platform has been expanded in recent years. As at 30 June 2018,
the platform carried 113 channels, 48 of which were PSBs or PSB portfolio channels (Source: BBC; UK

Satellite Help). HD services have been available on Freeview since 2010, when Arqiva upgraded the BBC’s
DVB-T Multiplex to the DVB-T2 standard, with additional HD services since the end of 2013. Going
forward, Freeview partners are investing £125 million over five years to build on the success of Freeview
Play and to improve the platform’s hybrid capabilities, including developing a mobile app and improving
content discoverability and navigation (Source: DigitalUK).

The revenue generated by a commercial DTT multiplex (bundle of digitalised and compressed TV services
combined into a data-stream for transmission over a single channel) is the product of two factors: (i) the
price broadcasters are willing to pay for a channel slot on a stream—either a full day or a part of a day—
and (ii) the number of streams that can be accommodated in a DTT multiplex. The pricing of DTT
multiplex streams is determined by the size and value of the audience that the broadcaster can reach, its
position in the Electronic Programme Guide, and the subsequent revenue that can be generated
(predominantly via advertising), as well as the balance between supply of streams and the demand from
broadcasters who wish to use channels. Across all customers, average revenue per channel has remained
relatively stable across the Group’s main Multiplexes (COM 5 and COM 6) from 30 June 2015 to 30 June
2018.

Multiplex operators (including Arqiva through its Digital Platforms division) pay the Group to transmit
their broadcasts. Contract prices for the provision of Network Access (NA) services and Managed
Transmission Services (MTS) are set within the framework of a reference offer (a NA Reference Offer and
**MTS Reference Offer, respectively). Under a NA Reference Offer, the Group is allowed to make a fixed rate**
of return equivalent to a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.71% (real pre-tax) on a pre-2015
regulated asset base used for NA services and a 7.5% WACC (real pre-tax) on post-2015 new capital assets.
Unlike the NA pricing framework, pricing for MTS services under the MTS Reference Offer framework is
set in accordance with market prices. However, the MTS Reference Offer framework requires the Group
to provide MTS services upon reasonable request and upon terms which are fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory. For further detail on the regulatory transmission services framework, see ‘‘—Terrestrial
_Television Regulation in the UK’’ and ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—_
_Competition Regulation—The Undertakings’’._

The DTT network has capacity limitations as a result of the limited amount of spectrum available to use in
the network which limits the number of multiplexes that can use it. However, improving compression
technology has enabled additional channels to launch on the platform. The introduction of two new
DVB-T2 multiplexes at the end of 2013 also created additional capacity and has helped to increase the
range of content on the DTT platform. The number of streams on DTT has grown over time, and DTT
now supports over 110 channels. The Group expects demand for multiplex capacity from broadcasters to
continue in the medium to long term, reflecting high anticipated broadcaster demand for streams due to
competition between channel providers, the strength of the hybrid DTT/IPTV platform and the
importance of the DTT platform as a means to access the TV advertising market. The Group also expects
demand for multiplex capacity to be positively impacted by the potential migration of channels from
traditional pay TV to FTA due to downwards pressure on carriage fees paid to them by pay TV operators.

DTT coverage is now 98.5% for Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs) and approximately 90% for
commercial channels (Source: Ofcom), making DTT the platform with the widest reach in the UK and the
only platform that meets the coverage requirement of 98.5% for the PSBs as at 30 June 2018. In light of its
coverage, high uptake and FTA capabilities, DTT benefits from very strong political and regulatory
support.

_DTH Satellite_

Direct-to-Home (DTH) pay-television uses satellite transmission to broadcast content. DTH satellite
pay-television is provided by Sky and is available to approximately 98% of the population and had
approximately 8.7 million households in the UK using it with subscription as at 31 March 2018 (Source:
BARB). Sky has also developed a wide range of services, including multi-room services, the Sky+ personal
video recorder service, multiple HD channels and UHD.

There are currently two providers of FTA DTH, Freesat and Sky. Freesat, launched in 2008, is a FTA DTH
satellite service jointly owned by ITV and the BBC. It offers over 200 channels, 98% service availability to
UK homes and had approximately 1.2 million households in the UK using it as at 31 March 2018 (Source:
BARB). While FTA DTH satellite offers more channels than Freeview and greater HD capability,
adoption is far lower than DTT at approximately 6%.

122


-----

Sky offers its own variation of the FTA DTH service, Freesat from Sky. Freesat from Sky customers have
access to all the channels available on Freesat, along with some additional networks, with no subscription
costs.

_Cable Television—Virgin Media_

Virgin Media operates the UK’s only cable television network and provides television, internet and
telephony services to approximately 4.2 million households as at 31 March 2018 (Source: BARB). Due to
the limited physical extent of the cable network, only approximately 15 million homes in the UK are
capable of accessing the network, representing 47% of UK households (Source: Virgin Media) and less
than 30% of households capable of accessing the network currently do so. Virgin Media has recently been
expanding its network coverage with the goal to connect 4 million premises to speeds of 300Mbps by the
end of 2019 as part of its Project Lightning. Project Lightning is reported to be behind schedule (Source:
The Register).

_IPTV and OTT_

Internet Protocol television (IPTV) and OTT services have been introduced in recent years, including as
forms of non-linear on-demand television. Although both platforms use the internet to deliver content,
they differ in the type of technology used. OTT offers content to all customers who have a broadband
connection through open internet, giving access to a content library. IPTV typically uses a managed service
over an IP network operated by a fixed network operator, creating dedicated connectivity when streaming
content between the server and the customer.

The hybrid DTT/IP platform is currently available through DTT and a managed IP network (DTT+IPTV
from providers such as BT TV and TalkTalk TV) or through DTT with a connected TV which can access
services via the internet. These services provide the potential to be combined with OTT services such as
Netflix or Amazon Prime, enabling the creation of a ‘‘pay-lite’’ model, meaning that customers can pay for
specific content with greater flexibility. Pay-lite TV offers direct competition to traditional pay platforms,
including satellite and cable, and offers significant scope for households to move from full pay TV to
pay-lite offerings over time.

6SEP201804180791

(1) Approximately 1.3 million households either do not watch TV at all or only access OTT services via tablets, mobile devices or
PCs.

_IPTV Services (Hybrid with DTT)_

IPTV operates as a hybrid service in conjunction with DTT in the UK and represents a small yet growing
segment of the market. Hybrid DTT/IPTV allows consumers to enjoy the breadth of DTT whilst providing
an option for them to select the additional pay TV channels and/or free catch up services, and has
consequently been popular in the market, strengthening DTT’s position as the leading TV platform. IPTV
(hybrid with DTT) is now offered through a range of different platforms, including BT TV, TalkTalk TV,
EE TV and Now TV. However, only a portion of Now TV boxes include a DTT tuner, as some are IP-only
but plug into a TV to receive the full channel list via DTT.

YouView is the underlying technology used by BT TV and TalkTalk TV products. Developed by a
consortium of BT, TalkTalk, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Arqiva and Channel 5, YouView builds on the
existing Freeview platform to incorporate additional on-demand-catch-up services from broadcasters and
pay services. The channels available on Freeview continue to be delivered over DTT as part of YouView.
Compared to the current Freeview service, users of the YouView platform have access to a wider range of
content, provided that they have an adequate broadband connection. The service was launched in July
2012 and is offered through BT or TalkTalk. YouView is also offered directly in some TVs by Sony, where it
provides a comparable service to Freeview.

Other IP-delivered TV systems include Apple TV, Google TV and Roku. These systems are generally
capable of streaming and storing digital media, particularly video, and can provide access to web media
content such as Netflix and iTunes. However, the uptake of these systems has been relatively limited in the
UK to date.

Full IPTV without DTT support is currently limited by overall broadband adoption, network and in-home
performance. 20% of adults in the UK currently do not have either fixed broadband or a fixed landline
(Source: Ofcom). Whilst IP services can still be received at relatively low bandwidth speeds and average
broadband speeds have increased, the potential of stand-alone IPTV platforms may also be limited by the
availability and uptake of high speed broadband services and the capacity of the core network to cope with
tens of millions of simultaneous viewers. Around half of UK households had a superfast broadband
connection (at least 30Mbit/s) as of November 2017. In terms of coverage of truly fast broadband, only
45% of UK premises had access to ultrafast broadband (at least 300 Mbit/s) and only 4% (1.2 million) of
UK premises had access to full-fibre services (gigabit-capable) (Source: Ofcom).

_OTT_

Content is increasingly being delivered OTT via the internet—both in terms of streamed linear channels
and through video-on-demand. Content can be delivered through third party platforms (such as Netflix or
YouTube) or direct-to-consumer. There is also significant overlap between the various OTT platforms, with
many households using two or more platforms.

Most major UK and international broadcasters offer direct-to-consumer services either on a free or
paid-for basis (including the BBC’s iPlayer service, Sky’s Now TV, Discovery Dplay and DisneyLife), which
offers viewers ‘‘everywhere’’ access to linear TV programming and access to catch-up TV. There is also
increasing monetisation of content through OTT direct-to-consumers by rightsholders (i.e. companies that
own content rights but do not broadcast via a linear channel on traditional platforms, such as primary
sports rightsholders monetising matches that are not part of broadcast deals, secondary sports
rightsholders, content archives and independent studios).

In addition, companies such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and Netflix are monetising content
OTT, and these companies have increasingly large expenditures on media management and distribution.

OTT platforms include: (i) advertising-funded video-on-demand platforms (such as YouTube), which offer
free access to a large library of video content with advertising; (ii) subscription video-on-demand platforms
(such as Netflix and Amazon Prime), which offer access to a large library of movies and TV shows for a
monthly fee; (iii) transactional video-on-demand platforms (such as iTunes and maxdome), which allow
users to rent an electronic copy of video material to download or stream; and (iv) electronic sell-through
platforms (such as iTunes, Amazon and Vudu), which allow users to purchase an electronic copy of video
material for personal ownership.

**_UK Television Viewing Trends_**

The following chart shows UK average linear TV consumption (minutes/day/capita) for the periods
indicated:

216 218 225 225 242 242 241 232 220 216 212 203

_Source: Ofcom; BARB_

Although broadly stable when looked at over the last two decades, linear TV, which is the traditional form
of TV consumption watched live over one of the traditional platforms (i.e. DTT, satellite, cable) has been
impacted in recent years by non-linear TV viewing (catch-up and on-demand services) and other forms of
non-linear TV viewing such as online video and social media. The launch of catch-up and on-demand
services has led to a decrease in time spent watching live linear TV and a growth in non-linear viewing.
Despite this overall decline in viewing, DTT has performed well, benefiting from the move towards
‘pay-lite’ services and away from traditional pay-TV. The average audience watching DTT has remained
relatively stable and its share of viewers over the age of four grew to 46.8% in 2017 (up 2.4% compared to
the previous year) (Source: FEH Media Insight). In light of the complementary nature of DTT and pay-lite
non-linear platforms (e.g. IPTV and OTT), the Group believes DTT is well positioned to benefit from a
continued interest in non-linear and pay-lite services which have helped to expand the overall DTT/OTT
or DTT/IPTV landscape while the Group believes that traditional pay platforms, such as satellite and
cable, are likely to see challenges to meaningfully increase the level of household uptake.

**_Broadcasters in the UK Television Industry_**

The broadcast industry in the UK consists of both PSB and commercial broadcasters, which have the
ability to broadcast their content on any of the available platforms. The national PSBs (the BBC, ITV,
Channel 4 and Channel 5) have obligations in their broadcast licences which require the PSBs to provide
DTT services covering 98.5% of the population, which the Group’s DTT transmission services network
provides. The purely commercial broadcasters, such as Sky and Discovery, operate free of public service
obligations with regards to either content or coverage. Despite the emergence of alternate competing
channels, PSB audience share (including their portfolio of services) has remained high at approximately
70% in 2017 (Source: Ofcom).

Sky is a large commercial broadcaster and platform operator which includes its DTH satellite service and
Now TV, providing a broad range of Sky-branded channels as well its own proprietary content. However,
its licence requires it to provide access to third-party broadcasters and abide by the prominence rules for
the PSB channels. Sky channels are predominantly distributed on this proprietary DTH distribution
platform, though most are also distributed on the Virgin Media cable platform as well as some on BT TV.
Sky’s Pick TV, Sky News and Challenge are also available on a FTA basis on Freeview, carried on the
Group’s multiplexes.

Today, the main five PSB channels retain over half of the total broadcast TV audience. Including their
portfolio channels, the PSB broadcasters account for over two-thirds of total channel share.

_Funding Framework_

The array of television channels available in the UK has been shaped by the funding framework. There are
three primary types of channel funding: television-licence funded, advertisement funded and subscription
funded (e.g. pay-TV). Secondary sources of television funding are: transaction funded, sponsorship funded
and other public funding sources.

_BBC_

The BBC, which is one of the Group’s key customers for DTT transmission services and radio, was the first
television broadcaster in the UK and remains a central element of the UK broadcasting environment. In
the United Kingdom and its Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man), any household

125


-----

watching or recording live television transmissions as they are being broadcast (terrestrial, satellite, cable
or internet) is required to purchase an annual television licence, except for people over the age of 75. As of
2018, fees were £150.50 for a colour TV licence and £50.50 for a black and white licence (Source: TV
Licensing). Income from the licence is primarily used to fund the BBC’s television, radio and online
services. Total licence fee income was £3.8 billion in the year ending 31 March 2017 (Source: BBC).

As a result, the BBC has one of the most stable and established funding sources in UK media. The BBC’s
funding is reviewed every five to ten years by Royal Charter, giving it more certain funding than, for
instance, government budget allowances, which are assessed annually. The latest review was completed in
December 2016. In this review, the BBC was awarded an 11-year charter, providing the company with
more certainty and allowing it to implement decisions over a longer time horizon. In return for funding
from Royal Charter, the BBC must fulfil a range of obligations, including maintaining universal coverage,
defined as reaching at least 98.5% of the population (Source: Ofcom).

_TV Advertising_

Demand for the Group’s DTT capacity is driven, in part, by the success of commercial broadcasters, which
rely on television advertising revenues. Television advertising revenues are generated by three main types
of channels: PSB channels, PSB portfolio channels and commercial multi-channels.

In 2017, net TV advertising revenue in the UK was approximately £3.9 billion (Source: Ofcom). The net
advertising revenue of commercial PSBs (including portfolio channels) comprised approximately 72% of
commercial television advertising revenues in 2017, with approximately £2.8 billion (Source: Ofcom). The
net advertising revenue for commercial multichannels (comprising all channels, excluding pay TV, publicly
funded and commercial PSB portfolio channels) was approximately £1.1 billion in 2017 (Source: Ofcom).
In 2017, TV advertising revenues fell by 5.8% compared to the prior year (Source: Ofcom). The Group
believes this arose, in part, as a result of weakness in the economy, including a depreciation of the British
pound and inflationary pressures.

While online advertising revenues grew at a CAGR of 13.9% from 2012 to 2017, TV advertising was still
able to grow over the same period (Source: Ofcom). The Group believes that TV and online campaigns can
complement each other and that TV continues to play an important role for brand advertisers, particularly
those seeking to target a mass market. In addition, TV advertising has not suffered from some of the
challenges of online advertising, such as the use of ad-blocking software and the risk of being placed
alongside inappropriate content. Thinkbox, an industry advocacy body for commercial TV in the UK, has
argued that the return on investment from TV advertising remains strong. Thinkbox found that TV
generates 62% of short-term profit and has been the most efficient across all categories, compared to 22%
for print, 5% for radio and 5% for online video (Source: Thinkbox).

These factors are expected to continue to support TV advertising expenditure over the medium to long
term, reflecting the ongoing platform TV advertising provides to brands and media agencies.

_Subscription_

Subscription funded channels receive their revenue from viewers who purchase access to a channel (or a
portfolio of channels) on top of the available FTA options. They can also generate income through
advertising.

**_Terrestrial Television Regulation in the UK_**

For historical reasons relating to competition and regulation, terrestrial transmission service has two
distinct parts: MTS and NA. MTS is the managed transmission service the Group offers to Multiplex
operators which allows them to broadcast the transmission signal to their customers. NA is the
arrangement whereby a Multiplex operator (or other MTS provider) pays the Group for wholesale access
to its network of transmitter sites (such as building access including sites and antennas, power resources,
and the opportunity to install their own equipment). Together these services allow delivery of broadcast
media content to end consumers over the air.

The Group has a monopoly position with respect to NA and was the sole provider of DTT MTS in the UK
as at 30 June 2018. For this reason, the Group’s transmission services are regulated by Ofcom, and are
subject to the Undertakings given to the Competition Commission (now its successor, the Competition and
Markets Authority (CMA)) and overseen by the Office of the Adjudicator—Broadcast Transmission
Services (OTA-BTS), appointed by and reporting to Ofcom. Under the Reference Offer framework,

pricing for transmission services can be reviewed by the OTA-BTS. For further background, see
‘‘Business—Terrestrial Broadcast Business Unit’’ and ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the
_United Kingdom—Competition Regulation’’._

**_Digital Platforms Regulation in the UK_**

In the UK, five national DVB-T Standard Definition (SD) DTT national multiplexes and three national
High Definition (HD) capable DVB-T2 multiplexes have been licensed, based on the amount of spectrum
available in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) television band between 470 MHz and 790 MHz (including
local TV multiplexes). Increasing spectrum demand from UK mobile operators has led to a decision by
Ofcom to clear the 700MHz band. Hence, DTT services in the 700MHz band are currently being
reallocated to the 600MHz band.

The Group acquired the licences for COM 5 and COM 6 in 2002. At the same time, the BBC acquired the
licence for PSB 3. The licences for PSB 2 and COM 4 were retained by ITV/Channel 4 and SDN (owned
by ITV), respectively. On 29 July 2013, Ofcom issued to Arqiva the sole licence for the use of the 600 MHz
spectrum band enabling the Group to establish DVB-T2 DTT multiplex technology, which is capable of
providing HD content. The Group’s current DVB-T Multiplex licences will expire in 2026, but the Group’s
two DVB-T2 Multiplex licences can be revoked on 24-months’ notice. Ofcom has recently served notice on
the DVB-T2 licences, meaning that the licence will end in June 2020. However, Ofcom may permit services
to continue after that date through a new licence arrangement if there is not demand from MNOs for the
use of the spectrum. When the DVB-T2 Multiplexes become unavailable, the channel streams on these
Multiplexes will cease to exist. The Group’s HD multiplexes cover 73% of the population, but are only
available to viewers who have HD-enabled television sets or set-top boxes.

Out of the eight licensed national multiplexes, five have been allocated to commercial broadcasters (three
DVB-T and two DVB-T2), and three to PSBs (two DVB-T and one DVB-T2). There is only one
commercial national multiplex owned by another operator, SDN (owned by ITV). There is also a local
commercial DVB-T multiplex, owned by Comux.

DTT multiplexes are set out below:

are due to expire in 2026, but the Group believes there is a high likelihood of retaining or renewing these
licences due to: (i) a large number of DTT channels on multiplexes; (ii) continuing demand from
consumers for FTA TV; (iii) the Group’s strong positioning due to its existing customer relationships;
(iv) the Group’s investment in multiplexing equipment; and (v) the Group’s track record in delivering
value from the multiplexes.

In 2013, Ofcom announced a potential framework for introducing spectrum rental fees under an
Administered Incentive Pricing (AIP) scheme to encourage efficient spectrum use (i.e. proposing to link
AIP fees to the opportunity cost of the spectrum used). Ofcom has stated that it does not envisage applying
AIP-based fees until 2020, at the earliest. Based on the Ofcom statement, fees could be approximately
£10 million per Multiplex, and the Group expects that it will be able to pass through a portion of any AIP
under existing contracts with customers. In the interim period from late 2014 to 2020, Ofcom has charged
and is expected to continue to charge administrative cost-based fees to Multiplex operators, like the
Group, based on Ofcom’s direct costs associated with managing spectrum and the administration of
broadcast licences.

For further background, see ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Spectrum
_Regulation—Multiplex Licences’’._

**The UK Radio Industry**

Radio services are typically available in the UK through analogue and digital terrestrial radio transmission,
over the internet and through the transmission of audio-only streams on terrestrial and satellite TV
platforms.

Compared to the television market, where broadcasters are nationally focused, local stations, whether
BBC, commercial or community stations, are an important feature of the UK radio industry. Community
radio licences were introduced by Ofcom in 2005 and operate on a non-profit basis.

Analogue radio works using frequency or amplitude modulation (FM and AM, respectively). An analogue
radio has two main components—the transmitter and the receiver. The transmitter (the radio tower) sends
out radio waves that have been modulated based on input from the content producer. The receiver picks
up the signal and plays the audio. Analogue radio benefits from wide coverage areas due to its low
frequency, but faces the risk of distortion and interference. By contrast, Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB)
compresses and encodes the audio signal in a multiplex, resulting in lower rates of distortion and
interference than analogue radio. The roll-out of DAB in the UK is primarily driven by its more efficient
bandwidth use (which allows more stations to be broadcast) and enhanced experience through wider
choice of features (including improved search functionalities).

Growth in DAB stations has been substantial, with the total number of digital radio stations increasing
from 208 in 2011 to 337 in 2017, a CAGR of 8.4%, of which the number of BBC national networks has
remained stable at 11. The Group intends to support its customers and the industry by continuing to
develop digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for listeners and planning for the expected eventual
phase-out of analogue radio at a point where this is acceptable to listeners and the industry, as determined
by the UK government. The Group has been, and expects to continue, rolling out DAB to fill the
remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default replacement network for analogue services.
In addition, the Group plans to continue to assess options to expand the coverage of the networks in which
it is the licensed DAB Multiplex operator, as well as the range of channels available, to give listeners the
best possible DAB experience.

**_Popularity of Radio_**

Absolute radio listening hours for adults (including ages 15+) in the UK has remained broadly stable over
the last decade, with total weekly listening in excess of one billion hours. Per listener, the average amount
of weekly radio listening hours has remained high over the last ten years at an average 21 hours per week,
equating to over three hours per day (Source: RAJAR). This is despite the launch of disruptive internet
radio and streaming services such as Spotify (2008), Deezer UK (2011), BBC iPlayer Radio (2012) and
Apple Music (2015).

Radio has remained resilient, and the Group expects it to remain resilient for a range of reasons, including
that IP delivery is presently unable to reliably serve car listeners, households with an existing radio device
have limited incentive to change due to the cost involved, and the fact that there is a high installed base of
domestic radios.

**_Radio Industry Revenues_**

Commercial radio is funded purely through radio advertising and sponsorship, unlike BBC radio, which is
funded from the licence fee. On average, a £24.24 portion of each £145.50 annual licence fee was allocated
to BBC Radio in 2016/17 (Source: BBC).

Since 2011, radio advertising revenue has remained stable at approximately £0.6 billion each year, and has
been unaffected by the rise of online advertising (Source: Ofcom).

Many BBC and commercial radio services broadcast using digital technology, particularly through DAB
transmissions, digital television and online. Whilst total absolute radio listening hours per week have
remained stable, the proportion of digital radio listening hours has increased significantly from 34% in the
first quarter of 2013 to 51% in the first quarter of 2018 (Source: RAJAR). Of this total digital listening,
72% was over DAB radios, 9% was on digital television platforms and around 18% was delivered over the
internet and mobile devices (Source: RAJAR). The number of DAB stations has also grown significantly in
recent years, from 208 in 2011 to 337 in 2017 and, of these, 31 are national commercial stations and 11 are
national BBC stations (Source: Ofcom). Furthermore, DAB penetration has been increasing over the past
years and the percentage of the adult population claiming to have access to a DAB receiver was
approximately 62% as at 31 March 2018 (Source: RAJAR).

**_Digital Radio Switchover_**

Uncertainty remains regarding the timing of the potential Digital Radio Switchover (DRS) programme,
which would shift the radio broadcasting market from analogue services to DAB. The government has
stated that it will consider DRS again when the DAB targets have been met. The DAB targets include:
(i) national DAB coverage must be comparable to FM; (ii) local DAB must reach 90% of the population
and all major roads; and (iii) 50% of all radio listening must be digital (Source: Ofcom). The Group has
completed its roll-out of new DAB sites to improve coverage. The listening targets have now been achieved
(50.9% as at 31 March 2018). As a result, the Group is awaiting details and confirmation from the
Government on its plans for a review.

The following chart shows the share of all radio listening via a digital platform (comprising DAB, online,
radio applications and digital TV) in the UK for the periods indicated:

_Source: RAJAR_

In order for the DRS to occur, further roll-out of DAB would be required, particularly to increase the BBC
coverage levels to match the current levels of AM/FM coverage and to improve DAB coverage on roads.

While the timing of any switchover from analogue to digital radio remains uncertain, the Group believes
that there is scope for DRS to commence before 2030, as a result of sufficient DAB uptake by that date to
overcome political and listener challenges. Most stations will continue to be simultaneously broadcast on

both analogue and DAB during the transition period, meaning the Group will continue to receive revenues
from both analogue and DAB broadcasting.

**_Radio Broadcast Regulation in the UK_**

As with TV, radio broadcast service has two distinct parts: MTS and NA. Together these services allow
delivery of broadcast media content to end consumers over the air. The Group has a monopoly position
with respect to NA and provides MTS for the BBC and nearly all commercial radio broadcasters in the UK
as at 30 June 2018. For this reason, the Group’s radio transmission services are regulated by Ofcom, and
are subject to the Undertakings given to the Competition Commission (now its successor, the CMA) and
overseen by the OTA-BTS, appointed by and reporting to Ofcom. Under the Reference Offer framework,
pricing for transmission services can be reviewed by the OTA-BTS. For further background, see
‘‘Business—Terrestrial Broadcast Business Unit’’ and ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the
_United Kingdom—Competition Regulation’’._

**The UK Telecoms Industry**

Mobile wireless networks in the UK are provided by four MNOs (EE, O2, Vodafone and Three) using
equipment installed in physical infrastructure across the UK, including the Group’s sites. Key industry
topics discussed below include network coverage and data growth, as well as the industry outlook for
network and spectrum developments.

**_Mobile network coverage_**

Following an auction of 800 MHz spectrum in 2013, O2 was obliged to provide 4G indoor coverage to 98%
of the UK population and 95% of the population in each nation in the UK by December 2017. Separately,
all MNOs were required to cover 90% of UK landmass and had also announced their intention to match
the O2 4G coverage obligation by the end of 2017. Ofcom confirmed in 2018 all MNOs have complied with
these coverage obligations.

Despite these targets, the UK is currently ranked 36th globally in terms of 4G availability and 41st in terms
of 4G speed (Source: OpenSignal reports). The coverage issue is more pronounced in rural areas. While
approximately 99% of urban areas have 4G, approximately 80% of which is covered by all four MNOs,
rural areas only have 89% coverage, of which only 21% is covered by all four MNOs (Source: Ofcom). The
disparity is largely attributable to a lack of new passive infrastructure development in rural areas which is
not economically viable for individual MNOs and JVs and often requires planning permission (i.e. for new
sites) which is difficult to obtain. Consequently, the Group expects infrastructure providers who can offer
shared economics to each MNO or JV on their own sites in rural areas to continue to see demand as
MNOs install more equipment on these existing sites in order to provide coverage and capacity in rural
areas.

Ofcom has proposed geographic coverage obligations on the forthcoming 700 MHz spectrum auction,
expected in 2019. The proposed geographic obligations require two licence holders to provide good voice
and data services across at least 92% of the UK’s total landmass. The obligations also include minimum
geographic coverage in each nation state: 92% in England; 92% in Northern Ireland; 83% in Wales; and
76% in Scotland. The Group believes this may allow for greater utilisation of the Group’s existing sites and
potential to construct new sites.

The following chart shows indoor and outdoor voice and data coverage for each of the MNOs in the UK as
at 31 March 2017.

**_Significant data growth_**


Through the early 2010s, UK mobile device penetration continued to increase. In 2017, there were
92 million active mobile subscriptions, a figure which has been relatively stable over the last three years
(Source: Ofcom). With a UK population of approximately 66 million (Source: ONS), the active connection
penetration in the UK is approximately 139%. Growth beyond 100% penetration has been made possible
due to a rise in multiple handsets or SIM cards per person, mobile broadband (e.g. data cards/dongles and
integrated SIMs in laptops and tablets), M2M communication (e.g. fleet-tracking services and passenger
cars with integrated SIM cards) and SIM cards in tablet devices.

As mobile device penetration has grown, so has smartphone uptake and coverage. Ofcom considers the
UK to be a leading smartphone country globally, with 74% of all adults using a smartphone in 2017
(Source: Ofcom).

UK wireless data usage has been growing significantly in the UK, with average data use per mobile
connection up 46% in June 2017 as compared to the prior year, putting pressure on existing mobile
network capacity (Source: Ofcom). There is still believed to be significant potential for data consumption
growth in the UK, based on consumption patterns in other developed economies—approximately 1.7 GB
per month per SIM was consumed in the UK in 2017, compared to 1.8 GB in France, 3.5 GB in Ireland,
5.5 GB in Austria and 11.3 GB in Finland (Source: Tefficient). The key drivers behind this lag include the
speed of technology adoption, network performance and the extent of wireless/fixed substitution (the UK
has a low penetration of data-only SIMs) and the cost of data. The Group expects this growth to continue,
with mobile data traffic projected to reach a total of 580 petabytes consumed per month in the UK in 2021,
up from 114 petabytes per month in 2016, a CAGR of 38% over the period (Source: Cisco).

The growth in mobile data consumption represents a significant opportunity for the mobile infrastructure
industry, and for independent infrastructure providers in particular, who will play a crucial role in
providing sites for MNO networks that can cope with such a strong projected increase in data usage.

Significant investment in the UK’s wireless mobile networks is still expected to be required in order for
MNOs to cope with such an exponential increase in data usage. In June 2018, the CEO of Ofcom stated

131


-----

that it would cost up to approximately £6 billion to ‘‘provide good mobile coverage across virtually all of
the UK landmass’’. In the Autumn Statement 2016, the UK Government announced its intent to improve
data networks, committing over £1 billion toward investments in fibre broadband and 5G mobile network
infrastructure.

**_Mobile Industry Outlook_**

In order to meet growing data demand and maintain service quality for bandwidth-intensive applications,
MNOs will need to increase their network coverage and capacity either through macro site densification/
upgrade or through the use of small cells.

In rural areas, macro site upgrades and densification (i.e. adding macro sites, spectrum bands and
technology upgrades) currently remains the most cost efficient way to do this. This can be achieved
through building new sites or increasing site sharing so that more active equipment is installed on existing
sites, though the scope for the former is limited by economic viability and potentially restrictive planning
permission. An increase in site utilisation may ultimately translate into increased revenues for passive
infrastructure providers. The Group believes that more installed equipment results in an increased
stickiness of revenues for infrastructure providers as the opportunity cost faced by an MNO changing site
increases with the amount of equipment installed at that site. In addition, the Group expects cell splitting
(the process of dividing the radio coverage of a cell site into two or more new cell sites, whereby capacity is
expanded within the region of the original cell site), will drive MNOs to use additional existing Arqiva
sites.

In urban areas, given limited ability to build new macro sites, technology evolution will also play a crucial
role as data usage continues to grow. Because macro sites and rooftops are congested in densely populated
urban areas, macro sites can be complemented by small cells on street-level infrastructure (such as
lampposts and bus shelters) and existing technology enhanced to become more efficient in coping with
data demand.

_Network densification—Small Cells_

Small cells are fully featured, short range, mobile phone base stations that can be used to enhance MNO
network capacity in high data demand locations where macro sites need support, such as city centres and
other dense urban areas. For 5G networks, small cells are likely to be a key technology in urban areas due
to the increased utilisation of higher frequency spectrum bands.

Street infrastructure is the most suitable option and the most attractive asset for small cells, meeting the
technical requirements while also solving issues such as site access as rights to street furniture are
determined by the relevant council as opposed to on a site by site basis. The Group has contracts in 14 of
the 16 London boroughs that have completed auctions of access to their street furniture, with access to
approximately 230,000 sites in total. The Group also has exclusivity periods for 13 of the 14 boroughs for
which it has concessions, of which 11 will expire before the end of the contracted concession period (which
extend through 2018 to 2022).

As with macro sites, it is generally more cost effective for MNOs to outsource the process to independent
small cells service providers who provide location, installation and maintenance services, leaving the
MNOs to focus on cell planning and overall network strategy. The small cells themselves are expected to
be owned and accounted for by the MNO in the same way as active equipment on macro sites.

Multiple small cell deployments are already in place internationally, for example in most major cities in the
US and South Korea. In the UK, the roll-out of small cells is at an early stage. Two UK MNOs have
already started deployment of outdoor small cells with the Group, and the other two MNOs are expected
to start trialling small cells in the near term. The expected addressable UK market for small cells includes
the inner boroughs of London and the central business districts of six other major UK urban centres:
Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds and Bradford, Cardiff and Edinburgh.

The highest demand for small cells is expected in London due to the city’s high footfall and high
population density. In addition, the nature of London’s property market makes roof-top densification a
costly and difficult alternative. MNOs are expected to upgrade rooftops where possible, but will also be
limited by antenna capacity and loading constraints.

132


-----

_Network enhancement_

In addition to increasing the infrastructure base via macro sites and small cells in dense urban areas,
MNOs can also look to enhance existing sites, which is expected to be their primary strategy to add
network capacity. Evolving mobile technology has contributed to an increase in network capacity by
making spectrum use more efficient. Recent technological advances such as multi-antenna technology
(Multiple In Multiple Out, (MIMO) and Massive MIMO (M-MIMO)) are key to increasing capacity
supply from existing networks.

Antennas are relatively cost effective versus other components and hence represent an efficient way for
MNOs to upgrade their networks. In addition, the price to host antennas is technology and frequency
neutral. MIMO and M-MIMO technology is beneficial to infrastructure providers as multiple frequency
band specific antennas increase residency on passive infrastructure whilst key enablers are already in place
(e.g. power, transmission and landlord relationships). In addition, in many cases, there is already an
existing structure capable of supporting additional capacity and, where there is not the case, it is relatively
simple to strengthen or replace the structure.

_Mobile spectrum availability_

Another aspect of the solution to the network capacity challenge focuses on mobile spectrum availability.

Spectrum (a term which is generally understood to mean the electromagnetic frequency range from 3 kHz
to 300 GHz) is the means by which all wireless devices communicate. Spectrum is a finite resource,
demand for which greatly exceeds supply in many frequency bands and many geographical areas.

One way of enhancing spectrum availability is spectrum re-farming, which involves reassigning spectrum
frequencies to services with higher value. Operators have already begun strategies for network
decommissioning and spectrum re-locating in line with their technology-neutral licences. For example,
Vodafone is re-farming several blocks of its 2.1 GHz bands from 2G/3G to 4G services.

However, spectrum re-farming has a limited ability to solve data congestion given that spectrum is a finite
resource and is bounded by the amount of spectrum held by individual MNOs.

While lower frequency spectrum can provide operators with sufficient spectrum from a coverage
perspective, additional spectrum in the higher bands is needed in order to support evolving data demand,
and this need is being exacerbated by 5G which requires higher speeds and large blocks of spectrum that
are only available in the higher spectrum bands. In April 2018, Ofcom auctioned 40 MHz of 2.3 GHz
spectrum, which was won by O2, and 150 MHz of 3.4 GHz spectrum, which was won by Vodafone
(50 MHz), EE (40 MHz), O2 (40 MHz) and Three (20 MHz). The 2.3 GHz spectrum band is already
supported by mobile device makers such as Apple, Samsung and HTC, and can be used immediately by O2
to provide extra capacity. Spectrum in the 3.4 GHz band has been identified as important in the roll-out of
5G across Europe.

Ofcom plans to release a further 80 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band and 116 MHz in the 3.6 to
3.8 GHz band. These auctions are expected to occur in 2019 or 2020.

In order to utilise new spectrum for mobile communications, mobile operators will need to install new
equipment that is able to operate on that spectrum. This is expected to lead to higher demand for services
offered by infrastructure providers such as the Group, and the Group believes may result in higher levels
of site sharing fees in line with the increase of additional site antennas, subject to existing commercial
terms with MNOs.

**_Wireless Telecom Infrastructure in the UK_**

Mobile wireless networks in the UK are provided by four MNOs: EE, O2, Vodafone and Three.

In order to operate a wireless network, MNOs use active equipment installed on a passive underlying
physical infrastructure network. The passive infrastructure network in the UK is largely comprised of
macro sites (i.e. towers) and rooftops. This infrastructure can be owned by the MNOs themselves or
typically licensed from independent infrastructure providers. The industry has experienced significant
consolidation of passive infrastructure in recent years as operators have attempted to control costs and
utilise resources more efficiently.

MNOs are expected to continue to require independent tower companies to provide infrastructure to meet
future data demands and coverage obligations (such as the 92% coverage proposed for future 700 MHz

133


-----

spectrum auction). Shared assets are more cost effective than self-build solutions, and MNOs’ operating
expenditure and capital expenditure budgets are typically constrained in light of the competitive mobile
market with flat average revenue per user.

In 2007, T-Mobile and Three created the first network sharing JV in the UK called MBNL, to deliver and
operate a 3G network. Two years later, following the merger with T-Mobile (to form EE), Orange joined
MBNL and also integrated its assets.

In 2012, Vodafone and Telef´onica formed a corporate JV called CTIL that expanded upon an earlier site
sharing agreement between Vodafone and O2 (a Telef´onica subsidiary). CTIL manages the network sites
for both companies, including the consolidation of sites to create a unified network outside of London.

As a result, there are now just two infrastructure-sharing JVs in operation in the UK, leaving limited scope
for further consolidation amongst the MNOs. This view was supported in 2015 when the EU blocked the
proposed acquisition of O2 by Three due to concerns around a reduction in customer choice and a rise in
prices. Recent government and regulatory publications have described at a high level the potential for
further consolidation to be permitted between MNOs to achieve specific objectives (e.g. expanded rural
coverage and improved coverage on rail and road networks). This may present opportunities for
independent infrastructure providers (such as Arqiva, WIG and Shere (Cellnex)) to facilitate this higher
level of sharing.

Network sharing has redefined the market, allowing independent infrastructure providers to become
increasingly important in the telecoms ecosystem due to the cost advantage associated with their ability to
host multiple occupants on their sites. Independent providers can host equipment from multiple occupants
(for example one independent site could carry equipment for all four MNOs) while incurring just one set
of maintenance costs and are therefore able to pass on economies of scale. This means that the MNOs
benefit from a decrease in their cost base, while independent providers see an increase in their revenues at
limited additional cost as more equipment is installed on their sites.

As MNOs continue to focus on cost efficiency, site sharing and infrastructure outsourcing is expected to
present a significant opportunity for independent infrastructure providers. Accordingly, the Group believes
that this will result in additional points of presence (POP).

In line with this trend, while the total number of wireless active sites has declined due to network
consolidation, the proportion of independent sites as a share of the market has increased, as network JVs
have consolidated onto these sites. According to the Group’s estimates, the number of macro sites in the
wireless market has declined from approximately 41,000 in 2009 to 35,000 in 2018. Of the 35,000 remaining
sites, approximately 54% are now operated by MNOs, 12% by other networks (Airwave & Network Rail)
and approximately 34% by independent providers. While the overall number of active sites has decreased,
the Group has grown its share by migrating MNO sites to Arqiva sites.

Scale offers a significant advantage in the independent market as it improves the ability to offer
competitive pricing and optimal locations. The Group is the largest independent provider with
approximately 8,000 active licensed sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018, followed by the
Wireless Infrastructure Group (WIG) with approximately 1,800 active sites, Shere (Cellnex) with
approximately 500 active sites and BT with approximately 300 active sites. In addition, there are
approximately 2,000 active sites owned by small organisations (companies with 10 to 50 sites). MNOs and
JVs remain the largest owner of sites—CTIL has approximately 11,000 sites and MBNL has approximately
7,500 (though the assets/ownership of MBNL’s sites remain with the parent MNOs). Airwave also owns
approximately 2,000 sites and Network Rail owns approximately 2,000 sites, but these are not utilised by
MNOs or other users at the present time.

**Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine and Smart metering**

The IoT is a ‘‘network of networks’’ of uniquely identifiable endpoints (or ‘things’) that communicate
without human interaction using a common connectivity platform. It involves multiple devices
communicating with each other through sensors and digital connectivity to form a combined network of
services.

The IoT industry is still nascent in terms of its commercial development. However, some of the world’s
largest technology companies, such as Microsoft, Siemens and Intel are actively pursuing the market
opportunity. Alongside technology companies, telecoms infrastructure providers are a key enabler of any
type of IoT use given the reliance of IoT on the ability to communicate data across a cellular or radio

134


-----

wireless network. Generally, the five key groupings of companies active in the IoT business are:
(i) enterprise software & service providers; (ii) internet companies; (iii) specialised start-ups;
(iv) industry & technology providers; and (v) telcos, though overlaps exist between the five groups.

**_Current IoT applications in the UK—Smart metering_**

_Gas and electricity smart metering in the UK_

Smart meters provide real time data on energy use across premises which can be used to help customers to
lower their energy consumption. This, in turn, can generate significant economic benefits for utility
companies and consumers.

In the UK, the government has mandated the roll-out of smart metering, committing to install 53 million
smart meters in homes and small businesses by the end of 2020.

The programme will be retail energy supplier led, with utility companies being required to install smart
meters for their customers. These meters are then linked to a communications network via a
communications hub linked to the electricity and gas meters. The contracts for the provision of these
communication services, including the provision of the communications hubs, were tendered by the
government at the start of the smart metering roll-out process in 2013. Telef´onica won the contracts for
South and Central England and the Group won the contract for the north of England and Scotland, a
region containing approximately ten million households.

_Water smart metering in the UK_

While suppliers in water stressed areas are obliged to offer meters to customers to limit the number of
reservoirs and desalination plants, there are no nationally set targets by the government or the regulator
for the installation of water meters in homes in the UK.

Given the lack of national mandates for water smart metering, the main driver of their development is the
economic benefit of smart meters such as faster leak detection, enhanced supply/demand planning, better
capital investment targeting and lower consumption, all of which can lead to significant cost savings.

As with gas and electricity smart metering, communications technology is crucial in allowing the two way
communication of data between smart water meters in the home and utility providers. The Group
currently provides these communications services to Thames Water and Anglian Water, the #1 and #6
water suppliers, respectively.

**Satellite and Media Industry**

Within the broader Satellite and Media industry that encompasses the various steps from content creation
by broadcasters or independent producers to viewer consumption, the Group operates across the following
steps of the value chain:

6SEP201805365000

_Source: Company information_

135


6SEP201805365000


-----

Once video content is produced, it is then processed through the media management part of the value
chain and value is added through services such as metadata creation, localisation, etc. Prepared content is
made ready for delivery as linear channels or VoD via multiple distribution paths, such as satellite (DTH),
DTT, cable or OTT. For satellite distribution, scale providers ‘‘multiplex’’ a number of channels that are
then uplinked to satellites before transmitting down to end consumers to receive via their satellite dishes.
For OTT distribution, providers supply services such as transcoding and watermarking before content is
delivered as linear streams or as VoD, either direct-to-consumers or via third party platforms.

Typically, various parts of the media value chain have been capital expenditure heavy, requiring investment
in physical kit and facilities (such as play out centres or teleports), but the market is evolving towards
virtualisation of media management and distribution capabilities, which enables delivery of less capitalintensive services.

The competitive landscape is fragmented along the media management and distribution value chain.
Broadcasters (and rightsholders who do not distribute via broadcast) may insource or outsource all or part
of that value chain, though there is a growing trend to outsource given the advantages of a unified,
seamless service across media management and (increasingly) multiple paths to distribute content, as well
as the trend to virtualisation. The global market for outsourced content and media delivery services was
$3.5 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow at a 10-year CAGR of 4.5%, reaching $5.4 billion in 2023
(Source: Euroconsult). The Group believes it has the opportunity to grow on the back of increased
outsourcing. There are few providers that operate across the entire media management and distribution
value chain. The Group is one of these, and has a reputation for managed service excellence that gives it a
distinct competitive advantage. Satellite & Media’s services are complementary to those of Terrestrial
Broadcast, and the two business units have a number of customers who buy multiple service lines
(including media management, OTT, DTH and DTT).

A number of trends are currently affecting the video market. First, consumer behaviour is becoming
increasingly ‘‘hybrid’’, with growing demand for viewing of video-on-demand anytime, anywhere, and a
parallel growing demand for second screen viewing, for both video-on-demand and linear content.

Second, the video distribution industry is facing a number of changes, which include:

- A growing number of distribution platforms (DTH, DTT, cable, IPTV and OTT);

- Improvements in compression technology, enabling more efficient distribution of high quality video at
lower cost;

- Globalisation of content, providing better monetisation of valuable content rights

- Increasing volumes of HD content, in both linear and VoD formats; and

- A slow growth in demand for UHD content, primarily focused on sport content on DTH, but more
widely available on IPTV.

These video distribution trends have resulted in increased operational complexity for broadcasters,
impacting business models.

As a result, broadcasters have been investing more in securing exclusive content rights, which in turn
creates an incentive to monetise expensive content globally, and to monetise OTT as well as through
traditional distribution. In addition, rightsholders (who do not broadcast) seek to monetise content OTT
(via streaming or VoD, and either through third party platforms or direct-to-consumer). In addition, these
trends have resulted in increasing virtualisation of media management and distribution capabilities,

These developments have encouraged operational and commercial flexibility, rather than a rigid focus on
one business model that has been prevalent previously.

**_Media Management_**

The media management part of the value chain begins with ingest of content (live or pre-recorded) sent by
broadcasters, production companies and other content/service providers to the media management service
provider. The provider then adds value by processing and enhancing content through, for example, services
such as quality control, encoding, adding metadata, localisation services and encryption/DRM. Prepared
content is then made ready for different viewing methods, such as linear channels (with services such as
scheduling, ad insertion and playout), or VoD (with services such as transcoding and watermarking),

136


-----

before being distributed through multiple pathways (such as DTH, DTT, cable or OTT) either
direct-to-the-consumer or via head-ends.

The Group is an established player with a strong focus on the UK and EMEA markets, providing an
advanced offering from the standard 24/7 monitoring of operations to the direct access to its distribution
network, content storage/ transmission and content preparation.

Media management historically focussed on preparing linear content for broadcast on TV through DTT,
satellite or cable. However, this line of business has been gradually declining, driven by a reduction in the
number of lower tier channels (moving to OTT distribution), a reduction in +1 channels at the major
broadcasters (whose utility can be better served by VoD) and an expected reduction in simulcast channels
(those that currently broadcast in both SD and HD variants) as a result of compression technology
advances and an ongoing switch from SD to HD broadcasting. By contrast, non-linear content
(i.e. video-on-demand) distributed via traditional and OTT platforms has been growing rapidly, driven by
the increasing preference of (in particular) younger audiences for anytime, anywhere viewing of content.
OTT delivery also enables rightsholders (who do not broadcast) to monetise content direct-to-consumers.
Altogether the growing OTT segment offers significant opportunities for the Group; for example,
Satellite & Media recently-launched a pay-per-view OTT service for live sports and other events.

The Group is also catering for the needs of broadcasters and rightsholders for greater commercial and
operational flexibility through a programme to gradually virtualise its media management and distribution
capabilities. Virtualisation refers to the transformation of capabilities from a largely hardware-based model
to one based on software stacks distributed on public and/or private servers.

**_Satellite distribution services: the UK DTH Distribution Market_**

There are two main routes through which broadcasters can access DTH. Broadcasters can either
self-manage their DTH capacity (i.e. lease satellite capacity directly from satellite operators) or access a
fully managed proposition by outsourcing to a third party intermediary. The majority of satellite channels
in the UK have adopted an outsourced proposition, at approximately 60% of the 697 total satellite
channels in the UK as of June 2018 according to Group estimates.

Services provided can be divided into multiplexing, distribution and the provision of satellite capacity
which in turn can be owned or leased from a satellite operator. Distribution is enabled via media teleports,
making technology an essential part of the satellite broadcasting value chain. Satellite service providers
who also own the infrastructure (e.g. the Group in the UK) have a competitive advantage as they are able
to generate higher margins resulting in higher profitability. Furthermore, they can ensure that quality
standards are maintained which is important given the emphasis that customers place on the quality of the
service delivered.

In the UK, five main operators provide DTH services to satellite platforms: Arqiva, Sky, Globecast, SES
and Babcock. The Group is the market leader in the managed proposition market, with an estimated
outsourced market share of approximately 48% of fully managed channels as of June 2018. As of June
2018, the Group estimates Sky had a market share of approximately 27% of the managed channels
(excluding self-managed proprietary channels), Globecast has approximately 20% of the market share, and
SES and Babcock had together a market share of approximately 5%.

Demand for satellite capacity for UK DTH is impacted by three major trends: (i) increased uptake of HD/
UHD; (ii) improved compression (MPEG-4 vs. MPEG-2); and (iii) switch off of +1 channels.

In aggregate, the overall demand for UK DTH satellite capacity is expected to remain relatively stable,
with a reduction in the short-term driven by the expected switch-off of simulcast SD channels, followed by
an increase in the medium-term, due to the expected growth in higher-capacity (in terms of Mbit/s) HD
and UHD channels. As of 30 June 2018, only 19% of channels on Sky UK were HD.

**_Managed Networks and Solutions for Occasional Use Events_**

Managed networks consist of the distribution of video content either via satellite or fibre to broadcasters
across the globe. Content is received from broadcasters and content owners and then distributed via leased
satellite and fibre to a specific coverage area (e.g. Europe or a part of Asia). The broadcasters then receive
the video content and distribute it further to end consumers.

Key players in the market include SES, Globecast, Babcock and Arqiva. SES and Globecast are global
players in relation to both contribution and distribution whilst Babcock and Arqiva offer a predominantly

137


-----

UK/EMEA focused contribution service with global distribution. The Group is able to provide an
attractive and fully managed customer proposition by leveraging on its strong global client relationships.

_Key trends for Managed Networks_

There are three major trends that are expected to drive change in the managed network industry over the
next 15 years:

(a) Customer needs: customers are primarily concerned about receiving a reliable service that meets their
needs. Broadcasters are looking for reliable managed networks, typically achieved by using a
minimum of two transmission systems (either two working systems or one primary/one back-up) and
up to four systems for larger channels, combined with the mix of different transmission mediums and
providers.

(b) Data volumes: overall content transmitted across networks has been growing significantly in recent
years, mainly driven by strong demand for occasional use and OTT. In addition to increased demand
for Tier 1 sports, there is growing demand for Tier 2 live sports events (e.g. e-sports) and better
geographic coverage as well as increased demand for OTT content and remote production.

(c) Technology: High Throughput Satellite for point-to-point distribution provides higher bandwidth at
lower costs. Furthermore, new IP-based (open internet) distribution networks are an emerging
alternative to established point to point solutions from the live event or content owner to the data
centres, which, while offering geographic opportunities, could result in additional pressure on prices.
In 2015, the Group launched its own IP-based contribution service and has plans to expand into
IP-based distribution.

While customer needs will have a neutral effect on the managed networks market, data volumes and
technology will have a positive effect on managed networks developments.

_Events and Occasional Use_

Solutions for Events and Occasional Use provide a similar type of service to managed networks as it
distributes content to broadcasters across the globe. As the business denomination states, this unit is
characterised by being an ad-hoc service available for special seasonal events, mostly for organised sports
competitions (e.g. the Olympics, Tour de France, World Cup, etc.) or events with a particular global impact
that need a wider temporary coverage, such as US Presidential elections. Therefore, increased global
connectivity has continued to drive demand for content transmission.

**_Satellite Data Communication_**

Satellite Data Communication (SDC) provides data services for those that cannot easily access ‘normal’
internet connections (e.g. oil rigs). The customer has a modem or router that links its workstations to a
satellite receiver or transmitter. Then, the data is transmitted from the customer’s location to the satellite
transponder, which has dedicated capacity to receive and transmit data. Finally, data is transmitted from
teleport locations and linked to the internet backbone. The Group has leased dedicated capacity on
satellite to receive and transmit data, it receives data from its own teleport locations and links this to the
internet backbone or dedicated circuits.

In the medium-to-long term, demand for SDC services is expected to grow, driven by the increased
transmission of data. However, the likely impact on revenues of this increased demand is expected to be
partly offset by price deflation driven by the introduction of new technologies (e.g. High Throughput
Satellites).

_‘‘Forward Looking Statements’’._

**Overview**

The Group is the UK’s pre-eminent national provider of television and radio broadcast infrastructure and
the leading independent provider of communications infrastructure to mobile network operators (MNOs)
in the UK. In addition, the Group has been an early participant in the development of
Machine-to-Machine (M2M) infrastructure in the UK through its smart water and energy metering
services and through other Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions. The Group is also a leading provider of
satellite uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of
channels available for UK DTH satellite broadcast. The Group’s unique and long-life asset base enables it
to generate revenues underpinned by long-term inflation-linked contracts, as demonstrated by a strong
orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018, with significant revenue visibility. Approximately 85.6% of the
Group’s actual revenues realised in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at 30 June
2017.

The Group operates through three main business units, which correspond to its three reporting segments,
except for its Other reporting segment, which includes non-revenue generating central corporate functions.

- _Terrestrial Broadcast—The Group benefits from a regulated position as the sole UK national provider_
of transmission services for digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasting, the most popular
television broadcast platform in the UK in terms of the number of homes served. The Group operates
all television transmission sites used for DTT broadcasting in the UK, with over 1,100 sites covering
98.5% of the UK population. Through its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market
leader for the provision of access to the DTT platform for broadcast channels, owning two national
commercial DVB-T Multiplexes and a further two High Definition (HD) capable DVB-T2 Multiplexes
(DVB-T2 Multiplexes) used for transmission of DTT services in the UK. The Group’s DTT Multiplexes
carried 62 out of a total of 113 DTT channels in the UK as at 30 June 2018. DTT, through the
subscription-free platform, Freeview, enables the public service broadcasters (PSBs) to meet the
obligation under their licences to extend coverage to 98.5% of the UK population. The Group
believes that DTT has a long-term future as the most economic model to provide free-to-air (FTA)
television providing near-universal coverage in the UK, which it expects will be complemented, but
not replaced by, certain ‘‘over-the-top’’ (OTT) services. The Group believes that there will remain a
long-term need for a highly economic source of FTA linear TV available to the UK population and
believes that the DTT platform, as complemented by OTT services, is best placed to deliver this.

The Group also benefits from its regulated position as the leading UK national provider of radio
broadcast transmission services, covering both analogue and digital services through Digital Audio
Broadcast (DAB). The Group had radio network infrastructure comprising approximately 1,735
analogue transmitters and 990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites in the UK as at 30 June 2018. The
Group is also the operator of the two national commercial digital radio multiplexes (including through
JVs) and held 25 of the UK’s 57 local DAB radio licences as at 30 June 2018. Further, the Group is
the service provider for the BBC national digital radio Multiplex. The Group intends to support its
customers and the industry by continuing to develop digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for
listeners and planning for the expected eventual phase-out of analogue radio, rolling out DAB to fill
the remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default replacement network for analogue
services.

- _Telecoms & M2M—Through its Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the largest_
independent (i.e. not directly or indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites
in the UK, which the Group licenses to national MNOs and other wireless network operators to allow
them to provide services and coverage to their customers. The Group had approximately 8,000 active
licensed wireless sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. A significant proportion of
the Group’s active licensed wireless sites carried MNO equipment, which the Group estimates
represented approximately 21% of the total active licensed MNO macrocell site market as at 30 June
2018. It holds a strong and difficult-to-replicate position in rural and suburban regions where cost,
economies of scale, planning permission restrictions, application regimes with local authorities and
the secure nature of site leases (given the landlord’s limited ability to terminate the lease) would make
it difficult for competitors and MNO customers to replicate the Group’s infrastructure and footprint.
In addition, the Group provides installation services for the passive components (such as antennas and
feeders) of network upgrades and roll-outs on its own wireless infrastructure sites. The Group is also
positioning itself to be a leading provider of outdoor small cells infrastructure, having obtained access
to street infrastructure in 14 London boroughs. In addition, the Group provides indoor and outdoor
Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) in the UK, with 46 in-building systems installed in UK locations
as at 30 June 2018. The Group is also a leading provider of smart metering and M2M networks, with a
long-term contract to provide smart metering communication services in northern England and
Scotland for electricity and gas to approximately 7.0 million premises with SMETS2 (the second
generation of Smart Metering Equipment Technical Specifications) devices by 2020. In addition, the
Group provides a smart metering network for Thames Water that is expected to cover three million
homes once fully deployed and has entered into a trial contract with Anglian Water for smart metering
deployment.

- _Satellite & Media—The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit is a leading provider of satellite_
uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the UK in terms of the number of channels
uplinked for UK Direct-to-Home (DTH) satellite broadcast. The Satellite & Media business unit
serves as an alternative for customers who do not wish to self-manage access, with an estimated
outsourced market share of approximately 48% of fully managed channels as at 30 June 2018. The
Group operates more than 80 uplink dishes in five teleports (ground stations that act as a hub to
connect a satellite network to a terrestrial telecommunications network), accessing more than
30 satellites and delivering media content to five continents. The Group also procures third party
ground-based teleport services where a line of sight to a satellite cannot be achieved from its UK
assets. This infrastructure enables the Group to provide customers with a comprehensive range of
services to deliver their data, broadcasts and media services internationally, focusing on the UK utility
sector, oil & gas sector, and aviation & maritime sectors. In addition, the Group provides encryption,
multiplexing, uplinking and satellite space to channel operators through its media distribution
offering. The Group also provides media management services, including linear playout (preparing
and transmitting content to distribution centres), video-on-demand, streaming, metadata management
and other OTT services. The Group also provides over 100,000 miles of cable for leased fibre
connectivity.

The Group has demonstrated revenue and EBITDA growth over the past three years with revenue of
£884.0 million, £941.3 million and £962.4 million, and EBITDA of £428.4 million, £473.5 million and
£517.5 million, for the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

**Competitive Strengths**

Arqiva believes that its success to date and its potential for future cash generation and growth are primarily
attributable to the following strengths:

**_Unique and long-life asset base underpinning defensible market leading positions in all business areas_**

The Group has an unrivalled Terrestrial Broadcast asset base, which Arqiva believes is not economically
feasible to replicate. The Group benefits from a regulated position as the sole UK national provider of
transmission services for DTT broadcasting, the most popular television broadcast platform in the UK in
terms of the number of homes served. It operates all television transmission towers used for DTT
broadcasting in the UK, with over 1,100 transmission sites covering 98.5% of the UK population. Through
its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market leader for the provision of access to the
DTT platform for broadcast channels, owning two national commercial DVB-T Multiplexes and a further
two HD capable DVB-T2 Multiplexes (out of a total of five main national commercial DTT Multiplexes).

-----

The Group is a leading national provider of radio broadcasting transmission services, operating
approximately 1,735 analogue transmitters and 990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites, providing
coverage of up to 99% of the UK population as at 30 June 2018.

Within its Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the UK’s largest independent (i.e. not directly
or indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites, with approximately 8,000 active
licensed wireless sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. The Group’s portfolio accounts
for approximately 60% of independent sites in the UK, approximately four times bigger than its nearest
competitor, and 21% of the total active licensed MNO macrocell site market. The Group’s long standing
history in the communications industry has enabled it to build a unique portfolio of prime position wireless
sites. As at 30 June 2018, approximately 65% of the Group’s active licensed sites had no near MNO
competitor, meaning no competitor site within 250 metres in urban areas, 500 metres in suburban areas or
750 metres in rural areas. The Group’s sites are critical to MNOs, enabling them to meet current and
future network coverage targets as imposed by Ofcom. The Group believes it has a highly defensible
position in rural areas, since economic feasibility and restrictive planning rules for new sites make it
challenging, but not impossible if a long-term investment horizon and business risk is taken for competitors
to enter the market. In terms of urban infrastructure, which is evolving through new technology such as
small cells, the Group has also built up a leading position, winning access to street infrastructure in 14 of
the 16 London boroughs in which contracts have been tendered, with access to approximately 230,000 sites.
The Group also holds a nationwide licence in perpetuity in the UK’s largest contiguous block of 2x224
MHz of 28 GHz spectrum, as well as a licence in perpetuity for a further 2x122 MHz of 28 GHz spectrum
across London, acquired from Luminet in July 2017. The Group believes this spectrum holding, and the
Group’s compatible telecoms infrastructure, will be an increasingly valuable asset. The Group has also
positioned itself as a market leader in the UK for smart meter networks. It is one of only two
communication service providers for smart energy meter connectivity in the UK and a leading provider for
smart water meter connectivity. The Group believes its long-range radio solution provides a more resilient
solution and better penetration for smart metering, compared to cellular.

The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit is a leading operator in the fragmented satellite and media
market in the UK. The Group owns a significant asset base with 80 uplink dishes providing access to more
than 30 satellites owned by third parties and five teleports delivering media content to five continents,
supported by access to over 100,000 miles of leased fibre connectivity that enable the Group to deliver
reach to key media and broadcasting hubs in UK and around the world.

**_Structurally stable underlying dynamics in the Group’s core markets_**

The UK TV market is large and stable. Within this market, the Group serves the FTA segment via the
DTT platform. DTT, through Freeview, remains the most popular TV viewing platform in the UK, with the
highest adoption rate of all platforms at 70% of all households with at least one TV set (Source: BARB;
Ofcom). The UK DTT platform is supported by a number of important favourable structural drivers,
including the cultural role it plays in delivering live TV to viewers and its high relevance to broadcasters
and advertisers given the platform’s wide reach and strong political support (FTA viewing is popular
amongst the key voting demographics), as well as the difficulty of replicating coverage and access by other
means. The Group has the most efficient platform in the UK capable of enabling the PSB to meet their
98.5% universal coverage obligations imposed by Ofcom, making its infrastructure ‘‘mission critical’’ to the
PSBs. Shows on PSB stations continue to attract the highest viewing in the UK. In the week commencing
23 July 2018, all 50 of the UK’s 50 most watched programmes were on FTA DTT channels (Source:
Thinkbox). The Group believes there is also presently no credible replacement technology to DTT which
would rival DTT’s ability to provide universal coverage, its reach and installed base, and its ability to
deliver content free at the point of access. The role of DTT is not expected to change in the medium term,
as demonstrated by the UK Government’s renewal of the Royal Charter until at least 2028 and its
commitment to continue providing free broadcasting, and Ofcom has publicly stated its commitment to
DTT until at least 2030.

In recent years, the UK has seen the emergence of alternative viewing platforms such as hybrid DTT/IPTV
and OTT platforms. These platforms can be complementary with DTT, while offering competition to
traditional pay platforms which are broadcast through Satellite or Cable. The proportion of homes with
pay-digital satellite has fallen from 35% in 2011 to 31% in the first quarter of 2018, after peak uptake in
2010 (Source: BARB). Hybrid platforms leverage the reach and cost effectiveness of DTT to deliver the
FTA services with interactive services typical of IP, such as catch-up and on-demand. The increase in ‘‘pay
lite’’ services (e.g. Netflix, Amazon) gives consumers further optionality to combine DTT with a cheaper

141


-----

OTT offering. This trend also supports the Satellite & Media division, which has been providing IP streams
and VoD processing services since 2015 and has over the past two years invested in cloud-based delivery
services.

The left-hand chart below shows the percentage of households in the UK which are covered by and have
adopted DTT, satellite and cable as at 31 March 2018. The right-hand chart below shows the historical
timeline for the launch of hybrid DTT/IPTV platforms in the UK.

given platform. Household may use more than one technology platform to watch TV.

(2) 36% pay (Sky) coverage; 4% free (Freesat) coverage.

The Group is also the leading independent provider of passive telecoms infrastructure, a position which
the Group expects to strengthen as MNOs continue to extend their networks. The UK is currently ranked
36[th] globally in terms of 4G availability and 41[st] in terms of 4G speed. The Group plays a key role in the
MNOs’ coverage solution due to its unique site portfolio. In addition, exponential mobile data traffic
growth is forecasted to continue, which will require a significant increase in network capacity. In order to
increase coverage and capacity, in particular for 5G where small cells are likely to be a key technology,
MNOs will have to invest in their networks benefiting infrastructure providers such as Arqiva.

**_Highly secure revenue underpinned by long term inflation-linked contracts_**

The Group has significant revenue visibility with an orderbook of £5.0 billion as at 30 June 2018,
representing more than five times coverage of revenues for the year ended 30 June 2018. The orderbook is
underpinned by the Group’s established relationships with its high-quality customers. Long-term contracts
provide the Group with a high degree of visibility over a significant portion of its expected annual revenue
at the commencement of each financial year. Approximately 85.6% of the Group’s actual revenues realised
in the year ended 30 June 2018 were already contracted as at 30 June 2017.

The Group has a diverse, blue-chip customer base across all business units, including all the UK’s PSBs
(BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5), and major international broadcasters (e.g. Discovery, Turner, ESPN),
major radio groups (BBC, Global Radio, Bauer Media), major smart metering customers (Data
Communications Company (the **DCC) and Thames Water) and all the UK’s MNOs (EE, Three, O2,**
Vodafone and their JVs, Mobile Broadband Network Limited (MBNL) and Cornerstone
Telecommunications Infrastructure Limited (CTIL)). These established long-term relationships
demonstrate the importance of Arqiva’s assets and infrastructure to its customers. Certainty over contract
renewals is supported by limited viable alternatives, as well as the ‘mission critical’ nature of the services
that Arqiva provides, leading to significant switching costs and operational risks for customers.

Within the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit, DTT transmission contracts are typically over 20 years in
original duration. Moreover, the Group’s DTT transmission contracts are inflation-linked, and otherwise
set so as to deliver a fixed rate of return relative to the underlying asset base. The PSBs have been willing
to sign long-term agreements with the Group for DTT broadcast, given the Group’s position as the only
provider capable of meeting PSB coverage obligations and the PSB licences, which obligate them to use
the Group’s DTT network. As a result of these features of the contractual terms and the fact that there are
no scheduled regulatory reviews of customer contracts once contractually agreed, the Group benefits from
a degree of long-term revenue visibility. Digital Platforms contracts are typically three to six years in
duration. Radio contracts within the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit are typically eight to 12 years in
original duration and are often inflation-linked. Within the Satellite & Media business unit, contracts are
typically three to five years in duration and are partially inflation-linked. Within the Telecoms & M2M
business unit, telecoms contracts are typically seven to ten years in original duration and inflation-linked,

142

-----

and smart metering contracts can be up to 15 years in original duration and inflation-linked. The
commercial terms of the Group’s Telecoms contracts are structured to encourage MNOs to add more
equipment to sites. As MNOs increase the amount of equipment in place on Arqiva sites, the total rental
fee per site increases, subject to MNO-specific contract terms, as does the opportunity cost of moving sites,
making these contracts and subsequent revenues increasingly ‘‘sticky’’.

7SEP201817043203

**_Strong cash conversion combined with a resilient business provides sustainable cashflows_**

The Group is able to convert its stable contracted revenues into cash, achieving strong cash flow
conversion throughout 2016 to 2018, despite reaching a peak in its investment cycle over the same period.
In addition, EBITDA margins have improved over the same period as the Group has made progress on its
efficiency programmes.

Capital expenditure is expected to decline after 2018 as the major capital expenditure requirements
relating to the roll out of projects such as smart metering and the current phase of DAB roll-out projects
are completed, significantly enhancing cash conversion. The majority of the capital expenditures for the
Group’s smart metering contracts with the DCC and Thames Water have been completed, as the networks
have been mostly built. In addition, the commercial terms of these contracts mostly allow for capital
expenditures to be paid upfront, and any change request payments are mostly pre-paid against delivery
milestones. All major capital expenditure programmes are directly linked to contracts in place, keeping
speculative capital expenditure to a minimum. The Group has achieved tight control over its maintenance
capital expenditure, contributing to cash conversion on an EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditure
basis of approximately 95% over recent years.

The Group’s underlying business and long-term nature of its contracts as well as its cash earning track
record is evidenced by the Group’s investment grade rating at the senior level.

The Group is currently implementing a company-wide transformation programme to streamline processes,
modernise IT systems and achieve third-party cost efficiencies. The Group believes this programme, aimed
at achieving efficiencies and reducing costs by optimising the Group’s cost base and driving margin
improvements by reducing overhead, consolidating business units into a more efficient structure and other
initiatives, will continue to result in improvements in the efficiency of Group operations and further
headcount efficiencies as major projects complete.

**_Experienced management team and workforce partnered with a supportive shareholder base comprised of key_**
**_experienced infrastructure players_**

The Group is managed by a highly experienced senior management team with a breadth of Telecoms
experience including tenures at Nokia, ICL, GEC, BT, KCOM and Cable & Wireless. The Group’s
divisional heads have an average of 25 years’ industry experience and a proven track record in their
respective areas. The Group also benefits from a highly talented workforce with approximately 700 skilled
engineers. Further, management have brought significant operating experience to the Group, focusing on
driving margin improvement through implementing a comprehensive cost transformation programme.
Their increased and continuing focus on efficiency initiatives has already seen impressive results,
contributing to EBITDA growth.

The Group is owned by a consortium of seven shareholder groups. The Group’s largest shareholders are
Frequency Infrastructure Communications Assets Limited (of which CPP Investment Board is an 86%
shareholder), Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund II, Conyers Trust Company (Cayman) Limited in
its capacity as trustee of the IFM Global Infrastructure Fund, First State Super, Motor Trades Association
of Australia Superannuation Fund (advised by Whitehelm Capital) and two Macquarie-affiliated
minorities (Macquarie Global Infrastructure Funds 2 S.`a r.l. and Macquarie Prism Proprietary Limited).

**Business Strategies**

The key components of the Group’s strategy are as follows:

**_Maximise value of strong core business and infrastructure_**

(a) Terrestrial Broadcast

The Group’s DTT platform and radio networks are the UK’s leading platforms for delivery of TV and
radio in the UK. The Group works closely with customers and is a member/shareholder in industry
organisations (such as Digital UK, Freeview, YouView and Digital Radio UK) which influence the strategy
and product development of the networks.

The Group’s strategy is to reinforce DTT’s long-term position as the most popular TV platform in the UK
by continuing to support the development of the hybrid DTT/IPTV platform (which can be accessed
through DTT sets capable of connecting to the internet or through a set top box), which is expanding the
range of catch-up services available as well as serving the needs of a pay-lite audience base. By continuing
to work with industry organisations, the Group aims to support the uptake of platforms that utilise DTT as
a core FTA delivery mechanism and improve the viewer experience through improved content discovery
and seamless integration of new types of content. The Group also aims to expand HD and SD channel
choice, thereby maximising Arqiva-owned DTT Multiplex utilisation, and work with the TV manufacturing
market through Digital UK and Freeview to ensure that the hybrid DTT/IP services remain the default
technology.

The Group’s radio networks are utilised by more than 49 million adults in the UK every week. Where the
Group is the licensed DAB multiplex operator, the Group intends to continue to assess options to expand
the coverage of its networks as well as the range of channels available to give listeners the best possible
DAB experience. The Group intends to support its customers and the industry by continuing to develop
digital DAB radio as an attractive medium for listeners and planning for the expected eventual phase-out
of analogue radio, rolling out DAB to fill the remaining coverage gaps, and positioning DAB as the default
replacement network for analogue services. The Group expects that it would be able to reduce its costs
following any eventual Digital Radio Switchover (DRS), given that DAB transmission equipment is more
reliable than analogue and will require fewer maintenance visits, and DAB transmission uses less power
than analogue.

(b) Telecoms & M2M

The Group intends to continue to pursue its current strategy, seeking to strengthen its position as the UK’s
leading independent telecom sites provider by increasing the Group’s site portfolio. The Group’s strategic
sites transfer programme is on track, with a number of sites already assigned and a number of site transfers
in process. See ‘‘—Telecoms—Licensed sites portfolio’’. The Group is actively pursuing the legal assignment
of the remaining sites and expects to complete the majority of transfers prior to the deadlines. The Group’s
strategy is also to increase each site’s tenancy by number of points of presence (POP) (i.e. any separate
MNO relationship on a single site) to heighten tenant retention and achieve higher site share fees. Taking
into account the sites and POP being transferred, the Group’s MNO site count has increased by 12% to
approximately 6,668 for year ended 30 June 2018 (compared to 5,929 in the year ended 30 June 2016), and
the Group has increased its MNO POP by 10% to 16,311 as at 30 June 2018 (compared to 14,814 in the
year ended 30 June 2016). In parallel, the Group will continue to focus on commercial relationships and
remain the trusted partner for its blue-chip customers (such as Vodafone and the other MNOs, as well as
BT and Airwave). The Group intends to build on its existing urban macro site portfolio and establish
Arqiva as the predominant UK provider of urban wireless telecom infrastructure by also installing MNO
equipment on Arqiva street infrastructure from exclusive concessions in prime locations. The Group also
intends to explore the potential to provide additional value-add services on its existing sites.

In the M2M space, the Group plans to leverage its existing communications technology (from the DCC
and Thames Water contracts) for the potential roll-out of new smart metering contracts (such as the trials
with Anglian Water) and additional M2M applications.

(c) Satellite & Media

The Group plans to continue to improve operational efficiency and service excellence within the
Satellite & Media business unit, and intends to take advantage of international growth opportunities
served by its UK infrastructure and virtualised capabilities. The Group aims to help broadcasters and

145


-----

rightsholders navigate and exploit the trends underlying the video market, including ‘‘hybrid’’ consumer
behaviour, increasing operational complexity and the need for operational and commercial flexibility. The
Group plans to do this through the expansion and development of its media management services and
distribution capabilities. The Group will also continue to focus on providing high levels of operational
efficiency and service excellence, including through its InSite e-service capability which was launched in
2018 and provides real-time service interaction and data to customers via electronic interfaces.

**_Continue to leverage investment in wireless sites and explore small cells opportunities through active_**
**_engagement with mobile network operators to increase revenue sources_**

The Group believes it is positioned to be a key beneficiary of the forecast increase in mobile data and from
the associated roll-out of 4G upgrades (4.5G and 4.9G) and ultimately 5G. As 5G is rolled out and demand
increases, higher frequency spectrum, such as 3.5 to 3.8 GHz, will need to be used resulting in a focus on
street level deployment to bring the network closer to the end user. The Group expects its passive
infrastructure to play a key role in providing solutions for coverage and capacity. For example, small cells
will be needed to densify the network in urban areas where new macro sites cannot easily be built. The
Group intends to continue to position itself at the forefront of the small cells roll-out, securing exclusive
long-term concessions for the use of street level infrastructure for small cell installation and is currently
undertaking initial MNO deployments. The Group has already contracted with two MNOs for initial
low-volume small cells roll-out, which are currently in progress.

The Group believes it is well positioned to capitalise on additional growth opportunities, including with
regards to its tower portfolio and potentially as a partner with alternative fixed network operators for fibre
backhaul to support outdoor small cells and 5G FWA solutions in the longer-term.

**_Simplify and standardise business in order to optimise operational costs and efficiency_**

The Group intends to maintain its focus on delivering comprehensive cost transformation, building on its
progress since 2014 and driving efficiencies and operational excellence across the organisation. The cost
savings programme is largely underpinned by detailed execution programmes and headcount efficiencies
are expected to be realised as the large delivery programmes reach completion and headcount delivery
programmes are realised. Delivery of savings is overseen by the FutureFit project management office and
the Group’s senior management team.

In addition, the Group may from time to time undertake disposals of assets in line with its strategy to exit
sub-scale businesses and focus on core offerings.

**_Maintain a stable long term capital structure_**

The Group has de-leveraged significantly since the 2013 bond issuance. Senior leverage (calculated using
an EBITDA of £525 million, which is used for covenant purposes) has been reduced from 5.6x to 4.4x
between 31 December 2012 and 30 June 2018, and total leverage has been reduced from 7.0x to 5.5x over
the same period. This reduction in leverage reflects the decision by shareholders to prioritise re-investing
in the company over making distributions. For example, the Group has successfully completed a number of
major capital programmes over the past five years, including smart metering and DAB roll-out, which are
now generating significant recurring cashflows. Shareholders have not taken any distributions over this
period. With the level of capital expenditure investment expected to fall over the coming years,
shareholders may consider regular distributions consistent with maintaining a stable long term capital
structure and investment grade senior debt ratings.

**History and Development**

The existing Group was formed following the acquisition of NTL Broadcast by Macquarie
Communications Infrastructure Group (MCG) in January 2005 and its merger with National Grid Wireless
(NGW) in April 2007. The Group’s origins can be traced to the transmission functions of the BBC, which
was established in 1922, and the Independent Television Authority, which was established in 1954 (later the
Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)). In 1993 the engineering division of the IBA entered the
private sector as National Transcommunications Ltd (NTL), which after MCG’s acquisition was rebranded
as Arqiva. In 1997, the home broadcast transmission division of the BBC was acquired by Castle
Transmission International, which was in turn acquired in 2004 by National Grid Transco, later named
NGW, and which was acquired by Arqiva in April 2007. The Group’s significant acquisitions include
Inmedia Communications Ltd in 2005 and BT’s Satellite Services businesses in 2007. The Group has also
disposed of significant non-core and subscale businesses, including the 2015 sales of its Secure Solutions
assets and its payphone assets/business (NWP Street Limited) and the 2016 sale of the Group’s WiFi
business to Virgin Media.

-----

The Group, through its predecessors, has been a provider of FTA television and radio transmission in the
UK since the inception of broadcasting in the UK. For example, the Group’s predecessors broadcast the
world’s first national radio service in 1922 and carried the BBC’s first television broadcast in 1936.

Between 2007 and 2008, the Group signed contracts with the national TV broadcasters and DTT multiplex
operators to carry out the UK government’s digital switchover programme. The digital switchover
programme consisted of the nationwide replacement of existing analogue and low-power DTT transmitters
with high-power DTT equipment. The digital switchover process commenced in 2007 and was completed
on schedule and under budget on October 2012. Following the completion of the digital switchover, DTT
now reaches 98.5% of the population.

The Group entered into a 15 year contract to provide a smart metering network for gas and electricity
providers in 2013, and won contracts to provide smart water metering for Thames Water and Anglian
Water in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The Group was also recently awarded a significant contract with
Ofcom and the major UK broadcasters to clear the 700 MHz spectrum. In 2017, the Group partnered with
Samsung to run the first UK 5G field trials using FWA in the 28 GHz spectrum owned by the Group. The
Group also acquired an additional 28 GHz spectrum licence from intelligent managed services provider,
Luminet, in July 2017. The Group has contracted with two MNOs for the deployment of small cells and is
currently conducting a trial of small cells with the other two MNOs. In 2017, the Group partnered with a
fibre company to deploy fibre to approximately 100 street locations during 2018 in Hammersmith &
Fulham to offer a shared antenna, cabinet and backhaul solutions to further stimulate small cell growth.

**Business Units**

**_Terrestrial Broadcast Business Unit_**

The Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast business unit operates as the sole UK national provider of end-to-end
broadcast services for national television and radio through its national infrastructure of sites and
transmitters. For historical reasons related to competition and regulation, the Terrestrial Broadcast
business unit consists of two further divisions:

- Terrestrial Broadcast, which provides DTT and radio transmission, DTT and radio Multiplexing
services and ongoing services; and

- Digital Platforms, which provides access to the DTT platform for channel broadcasters.

Within the Terrestrial Broadcast division, radio and TV terrestrial transmission services are offered in two
parts, Network Access (NA) and Managed Transmission Services (MTS). MTS is the managed transmission
service the Group offers to its customers to design, install, maintain and monitor the transmitter
equipment. NA is the arrangement whereby the Group provides access to its network of broadcast sites
(such as building access including towers, combiners, feeders and antennas, power resources, and the
opportunity to install their own transmitter equipment, if required). Together these services allow delivery
of broadcast media content to end consumers over the air.

The Group’s transmission services are regulated by Ofcom, and are subject to the Undertakings given to
the Competition Commission (now its successor, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)) and
overseen by the Office of the Adjudicator—Broadcast Transmission Services (OTA-BTS), appointed by
and reporting to Ofcom. Under the Reference Offer framework, pricing for transmission services can be
reviewed by the OTA-BTS. See ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—
_Competition Regulation’’. The Group’s broadcast transmission services contracts are long-term, with third-_
party television broadcast transmission contracts currently in place extending to between 2030 and 2034,
while radio contracts typically have initial contract terms of 8 to 12 years, some with customer break
clauses. The Group’s terrestrial broadcast contracts usually pass through the costs of certain expenses such
as rent, rates, taxes and electricity directly to customers and are linked to inflation, as well as setting a
guaranteed return on capital from the asset base. The Group also provides transmission services to itself
(in its capacity as a Multiplex operator), and significant intercompany revenue is derived from the Digital
Platforms division.

The Group’s Digital Platforms division owns two of the three main commercial DVB-T Multiplex licences
and two DVB-T2 Multiplex licences used for DTT and Freeview, which is subscription-free (other than a
TV licence fee) and the leading UK TV platform, as well as other DTT-reliant platforms, such as BT TV,
TalkTalk TV, YouView and EE TV. The Group’s Multiplex licences provide the Group access to spectrum
and the Group sells individual channel capacity to commercial broadcasters.

Revenue from the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit was £422.4 million, £449.0 million and £487.6 million,
which represented 47.8%, 47.7% and 50.7% of the Group’s total revenue for the years ended 30 June 2016,
2017 and 2018, respectively. The table below shows the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit’s revenue by

_Terrestrial Broadcast_

_Television_

The Group provides critical national infrastructure for DTT, the leading TV platform in the UK, with
installed user base of approximately 18.9 million households as at 30 June 2018, with approximately
11.6 million primary TV sets using DTT or hybrid DTT/IPTV (Source: Ofcom). See ‘‘Industry—The
_Television and Broadcast Industry in the UK—UK Television Delivery Platforms—Digital Terrestrial_
_Television—Freeview’’._

(i) Network access services

The Group provides NA services to Multiplex operators (including to Arqiva in its capacity as Multiplex
Operator through its Digital Platforms division) through a nationwide portfolio of sites, consisting of
physical infrastructure, support such as maintenance and on-site entry to facilities. Physical infrastructure
owned by the Group comprises the antennas, masts and sites, power sources, feeders, combiners and
remote monitoring devices necessary to broadcast terrestrial signals. It also includes the buildings for
utilities and maintenance. As at 30 June 2018, the Group operated over 1,100 television transmission sites
and masts throughout the UK. See ‘‘—Properties—Communications Sites’’ for a description of the Group’s
sites.

(ii) Managed transmission services

The Group offers MTS to Multiplex operators (including to Arqiva in its capacity as Multiplex Operator
through its Digital Platforms division), which allows the Multiplex operators to compile, sequence and
broadcast the transmission signal from their customers, DTT broadcasters. Through its MTS offering, the
Group facilitates use of the infrastructure provided through NA by managing dedicated transmitter
equipment and infrastructure and provides an end-to-end service and administers content distribution for
DTT. This consists of collecting television channel signals from broadcasters’ studios, distributing them to
over 1,100 Arqiva transmitter sites across the country, ensuring the transmission signals can be received by
television sets nationwide.

(iii) Regulatory framework and contracting

As the sole provider of DTT broadcast transmission services in the UK, the Group’s activities are
regulated by Ofcom, and are subject to the Undertakings given to the Competition Commission and
overseen by the OTA-BTS, appointed by and reporting to Ofcom. The Undertakings and procedures
established by Ofcom require the Group to publish Reference Offers for NA and MTS (a NA Reference
**Offer and** **MTS Reference Offer, respectively) setting out terms for wholesale access to its network**
infrastructure and management of the broadcast of the transmission signal whenever any relevant new
spectrum becomes available for broadcast purposes or when an existing contract for transmission services
is renewed. In view of its monopoly position with respect to NA, the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(WACC) the Group is permitted to make on NA contracts are set by the OTA-BTS.

Under the NA Reference Offer pricing framework, the Group is allowed to make a fixed rate of return of
7.71% WACC (real pre-tax) on a pre-2015 regulated asset base and 7.5% WACC (real pre-tax) on
post-2015 new capital assets. The Group is also permitted to make a regulated return on certain capital
expenditure projects which will result in higher revenue. In the year ended 30 June 2015, OTA-BTS
reviewed the Group’s regulatory pricing framework, resulting in a minor adjustment to the regulated

148


-----

return allowed on new capital investments. In its decision, OTA-BTS indicated that the revised return
allowed on new capital investments would remain valid until 2025, but that it retains the ability to conduct
an intermediate review prior to such date. While the Group has not received any indication of an
intermediate review of the return allowed on new capital investments, the Group believes that any such
review could be triggered if there is a material change in circumstances relating to Arqiva’s markets or its
financial position. The relevant circumstances or criteria which may prompt an intermediate review of the
return allowed on new capital investments are not defined by OTA-BTS, but the Group believes that they
would include a change in the broadcast transmission market, a significant alteration to the Group’s capital
structure or a deviation in the pricing methodology used by OTA-BTS in connection with the WACC.

Unlike the NA pricing framework, pricing for MTS services under the MTS Reference Offer framework is
set in accordance with market prices. However, the MTS Reference Offer framework requires the Group
to provide MTS services upon reasonable request and upon terms which are fair, reasonable and
non-discriminatory. While another MTS provider could request a NA reference offer and install its
transmitter equipment on the Group’s sites to provide MTS services to end customers, no such competitor
is currently active in the UK market for the provision of DTT MTS.

The NA and MTS Reference Offer framework permit the Group to pass through costs for elements such
as rent, rates, taxes, electricity and operating costs and its transmission services contracts are inflationlinked.

The Group’s current third party television transmission contracts have expiry dates between 2030 and 2034.
Unlike contracts for other public services such as utilities, there is no periodic regulatory review of DTT
contracts, which the Group believes leads to long-term revenue visibility. However, a review process with
the OTA-BTS, based on the Group’s Competition Commission undertakings, can be carried out by the
OTA-BTS for new contract pricing. For further detail on the regulatory transmission services framework,
see ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Competition Regulation—The
_Undertakings’’._

(iv) Customers and contracts

Given that the Group is the exclusive provider of transmission services for DTT, its customers include all
DTT Multiplex operators in the UK, including the Group’s Digital Platforms division. The Group’s
commercial agreements cover the provision of both NA and MTS. Fees are generated by broadcasting a
signal according to agreed criteria that meets a specified level of service availability as formalised in a
service level agreement (SLA). Customers have the right to terminate a contract if there are persistent
material breaches of the SLA requirements. Should the Group be responsible for persistent major failures
on a network, the Group may be required to return up to 10% of payments received in respect of that
agreement in any one year or provide service credits for future work. However, as at the date of this
Prospectus, the Group has consistently met its contracted service level requirements overall. For the year
ended 30 June 2018, the Group’s top three DTT contracts were with the BBC, Digital 3&4 (a PSB DTT
Multiplex operator owned by ITV and Channel 4) (D3&4) and S4C Digital Networks (a commercial DTT
Multiplex operator owned by ITV) (SDN).

(v) Competition

In the DTT business, the Group currently has 100% UK market share of NA and MTS, as well as sole
ownership of its physical coverage network in the UK. Accordingly, the Group’s DTT activities are
regulated by Ofcom and the establishment of its market position was cleared (remaining subject to the
Undertakings) by the Competition Commission (currently, the CMA) in 2008. As a result of the Group’s
market position, there are significant financial, infrastructural, contractual, regulatory and reputational
barriers facing any competitor. See ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—
_Ofcom—Significant Market Power’’. An MTS provider could enter the market by requesting a NA_
Reference Offer and installing its equipment in the broadcast sites. However, all existing contracts run
until 2030 and 2034, and any new competitor must be capable of providing specialist broadcast skills with a
national maintenance field force and be able to win the contract renewals from the Group, who is the
incumbent provider.

The Group’s DTT platform faces competition from other platforms for delivery of television services, such
as satellite, cable, IPTV and OTT, which provide alternative means of delivering content, which competes
for the Group’s customers and serves as an alternative platform for delivery of television services to which
the Group’s customers could switch. See ‘‘Industry—The Television and Broadcast Industry in the UK’’.

-----

_Radio_

The Group benefits from its regulated position as the leading UK national provider of transmission
services for radio broadcasting. The Group provides NA and MTS for nearly 100% of the analogue and
DAB digital radio transmission market in the UK, serving the BBC and commercial radio broadcasters.
The Group is also the service provider of the two national commercial digital radio multiplexes and held 25
of the UK’s 57 local radio licences (including through JVs) as at 30 June 2018

(i) Network access services

As with television, the Group provides NA services to radio Multiplex operators (including Arqiva in its
capacity as Multiplex operator) through a nationwide portfolio of radio transmission sites, consisting of
physical infrastructure, support such as maintenance and on-site entry to facilities. Physical infrastructure
owned by the Group comprises the antennas, masts and sites, power sources, feeders, combiners and
remote monitoring devices necessary to broadcast radio signals. It also includes the buildings for utilities
and maintenance. As at 30 June 2018, the Group operated approximately 1,735 analogue transmitters and
990 DAB transmitters on 741 radio sites throughout the UK. See ‘‘—Properties—Terrestrial Broadcast’’ for a
description of the Group’s radio sites.

(ii) Managed transmission services

The Group provides MTS to Multiplex operators and analogue broadcasters, allowing them to broadcast
radio transmission signals through to the listener. There are three national DAB Multiplexes. The Group
wholly owns and operates one of the two commercial national DAB Multiplexes, Digital One (D1). D1
covers 92% of the UK population and currently carries 14 streams based on mutually agreed commercial
terms. D1’s current licence runs until November 2023. The second commercial national DAB Multiplex is
owned by Sound Digital (SDL), a consortium of Arqiva, Bauer Media and Wireless Group (part of News
International). Its licence extends through February 2028. SDL provides coverage to 77% of the UK
population and carries 19 streams. The consortium operate this DAB Multiplex through a joint venture,
under which each partner has rights to capacity and has committed to capacity in proportion to its
shareholding. The Group has a 40% share in SDL and is the sales agent for all capacity on SDL. The third
national DAB Multiplex is owned and used exclusively by the BBC and currently provides 11 streams
accessible to 97% of the UK population, and the Group provides MTS to the BBC for this DAB Multiplex.
In addition to its national DAB Multiplexes, the Group owns 25 of the 57 local DAB Multiplexes in the
UK (including through JVs), primarily in the South and Midlands regions, and 30 of the remaining local
DAB Multiplexes utilise NA and MTS infrastructure owned by the Group. One local DAB multiplex
operator has an MTS contract with a third party provider. Some small local analogue radio customers
(typically local charities or small commercial radio stations) choose to install their own equipment on the
Group’s sites and self-provide the MTS service in order to keep costs down or work with other small
service providers, taking a risk with the availability of the service in the event the service goes off air.

(iii) Regulatory framework and contracting

As the Group is the leading provider of DAB and analogue radio infrastructure in the UK, the Group’s
radio broadcast activities are regulated by Ofcom, and are subject to the Undertakings given to the
Competition Commission (now its successor, the CMA) and overseen by the OTA-BTS, appointed by and
reporting to Ofcom. The Undertakings and procedures established by Ofcom require the Group to publish
NA and MTS Reference Offers setting out terms for wholesale access to its network infrastructure and
management of the broadcast of the transmission signal whenever any relevant new spectrum becomes
available for broadcast purposes or when an existing contract for transmission services is renewed. In view
of its monopoly position with respect to NA, the Group’s return on NA contracts is set by the OTA-BTS.

Under the NA Reference Offer pricing framework, the Group is allowed to make a fixed rate of return of
7.71% WACC (real pre-tax) on a pre-2015 regulated asset base used for NA services and 7.5% WACC
(real pre-tax) on post-2015 new capital assets. The Group makes a regulated return on certain capital
expenditure projects such as building out DAB coverage in advance of the expected DRS. See ‘‘—Digital
_Radio Switchover’’. In the year ended 30 June 2015, OTA-BTS reviewed the Group’s regulatory pricing_
framework, resulting in a minor adjustment to the regulated return allowed on new capital investments. In
its decision, OTA-BTS indicated that the revised return allowed on new capital investments would remain
valid until 2025, but that it retains the ability to conduct an intermediate review prior to such date. While
the Group has not received any indication of an intermediate review of the return allowed on new capital

investments, the Group believes that any such review could be triggered if there is a material change in
circumstances relating to Arqiva’s markets or its financial position. The relevant circumstances or criteria
which may prompt an intermediate review of the return allowed on new capital investments are not
defined by OTA-BTS, but the Group believes that they would include a change in the broadcast
transmission market, a significant alteration to the Group’s capital structure or a deviation in the pricing
methodology used by OTA-BTS in connection with the WACC.

Pricing for MTS services under the MTS Reference Offer framework is set in accordance with market
prices. However, the MTS Reference Offer framework requires the Group to provide MTS services upon
reasonable request and upon terms which are fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory.

The NA and MTS Reference Offer framework permit the Group to pass through costs for elements such
as rent, rates, taxes, electricity and operating costs and its transmission services contracts are inflationlinked.

Unlike contracts for other public services such as utilities, there is no periodic regulatory review of radio
contracts, which the Group believes leads to long-term revenue visibility. However, a review process with
the OTA-BTS, based on the Group’s Competition Commission undertakings, can be carried out by the
OTA-BTS for new contract pricing. For further detail on the regulatory transmission services framework,
see ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Competition Regulation—The
_Undertakings’’._

The Group’s radio contracts extend to between 2020 and 2030, and some include provisions for price
adjustments if additional DAB Multiplexes are licensed by Ofcom.

(iv) Customers and contracts

The Group’s customers include the majority of radio broadcasters in the UK. The Group’s transmission
services contracts are with the Multiplex operators (including Arqiva in its capacity as Multiplex operator)
for DAB and individual broadcasters for analogue radio. The Group’s radio contracts, both analogue and
DAB, typically have initial contract terms of eight to 12 years, some with break clauses. The Group’s radio
contracts are also inflation-linked. The Group’s key contracts expire between 2020 and 2030, including the
BBC analogue contract which is subject to renewal by the BBC in 2020. Management expects that the BBC
is likely to renew this contract, given the anticipated timeline for DRS, which will see analogue services
extending beyond that date.

In addition to charging a recurring fee to radio broadcasters, the Group also charges radio stations for the
cost of providing a link from the studio to transmission sites. The Group’s analogue contracts that are
subject to periodic renewal generally contain provisions that contemplate the possibility of analogue signals
in the UK being switched off during the term of the contract. The top three radio contracts, with the BBC,
Global Radio and Bauer, represented 70.3% of the Group’s radio revenue and 15.3% of the Group’s
Terrestrial Broadcasting business unit’s revenue for the year ended 30 June 2018.

The Group’s DAB multiplexes show high utilisation levels driven by strong market demand. This has been
supported by the launch of an additional channel, Hits Radio from Bauer Media, which has launched
across all of the Group’s local multiplexes to deliver a network providing quasi-national coverage.

(v) Digital Radio Switchover

In December 2013, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced a package of
measures aimed at improving the service delivered by digital radio prior to confirming the timing of DRS,
the process whereby analogue radio broadcasters will eventually be required to switch to digital
broadcasting. The Group expects conditions for DRS to be ready from 2026 onwards, based on industry
and listener interest. See ‘‘Industry—The UK Radio Industry—Digital Radio Switchover’’.

Since winning the DAB phase four roll-out contract from the BBC in 2015, the Group has completed the
latest phase of the delivery of the DAB roll-out programme for the BBC, and upgrades to the analogue
radio network as part of the contract. As at 30 June 2018, the Group had added 162 new transmitters on
air, increasing the national UK BBC DAB network coverage beyond 97% of the population. The Group
has also completed the network roll-out for the delivery of commercial local DAB. The programme is part
of an initiative to meet the local DAB coverage threshold of 90% as set by the UK Government in 2010.
This contract requires the Group to deliver new transmitters or upgrades at 221 sites and all work had been
completed as at 30 June 2018, achieving over 90% coverage.

151


-----

Following the award of the second national DAB Multiplex licence in March 2015 to SDL, construction by
the Group of the transmission network was completed ahead of schedule. The network was officially
launched by the DCMS on 1 March 2016. The service carries 17 commercial radio stations. SDL is the first
national DAB Multiplex in the UK to use DAB+ technology for some of the services. DAB+ uses less
bandwidth than traditional DAB, allowing SDL to carry more stations and expand listener choice. In the
first quarter of 2018, an expansion programme of the SDL network was announced, which is expected to
add 19 new transmitters to the network thereby increasing the coverage by approximately 4 million new
listeners by the end of 2018.

In the longer term, the Group expects that approximately 400 more sites would be required to support a
full switch-off of analogue radio.

(vi) Competition

In the radio broadcast business, the Group has a leading market position and has been subject to
competition and economic regulation since 2005. See ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the
_United Kingdom—Competition Regulation—The Undertakings’’._

The Group’s radio platform faces competition from other forms of media and audio content, including
CDs and IP listening services, such as Spotify, Deezer, Apple Music and Tidal. See ‘‘Industry—The UK
_Radio Industry’’._

_Digital Platforms_

_Overview_

Through its Digital Platforms division, the Group is also the UK market leader for the provision of access
to the DTT platform for broadcast channels. The Group owns two of the three main commercial DVB-T
Multiplexes and two further DVB-T2 Multiplexes used for Freeview broadcasts, the leading UK TV
platform. A DTT Multiplex licence grants a company the right to manage certain spectrum frequencies
over which it can broadcast combined digital transmission signals. These streams are organised for viewers
through an electronic program guide channel number assignment that is coordinated by Digital UK (a
non-profit organisation that facilitates Freeview use and sets the strategy for DTT, owned by the BBC, ITV,
Channel 4 and the Group), with low channel numberings typically considered more attractive.

As the Group is the sole UK provider of national terrestrial broadcast infrastructure necessary for DTT
and the leading national provider of terrestrial broadcast infrastructure necessary for radio transmission in
the UK and since the Group’s Digital Platforms division is a customer of the Group’s Terrestrial Broadcast
division, the Undertakings also require the Group to impose strict information barriers between the
Terrestrial Broadcast division and the Digital Platforms division, and subject the Group to regular audit.
See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Group’s business and industry—The Group is subject to UK
_government and other regulations that govern the way it conducts its businesses, and the effects of, or changes_
_in, regulations and government policy could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial_
_condition and results of operations’’._

Revenue for the Digital Platforms division was £168.3 million, £175.8 million and £173.2 million, which
represented 19.0%, 18.7% and 18.0% of the Group’s total revenue for the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017
and 2018, respectively.

_Multiplex Regulation_

In the UK, eight national DTT Multiplexes (commercial and PSB-owned) have now been licensed based
on the amount of spectrum currently available in the UHF television band between 470 and 854 MHz.

Of the eight national DTT Multiplex licences, three DTT Multiplex licences are owned by PSBs, while the
remaining five are commercially owned. The Group owns two of the three national commercial DVB-T
Multiplex licences in the UK. The Group also owns two DVB-T2 Multiplex licences (which will expire in
2020 in accordance with the notice recently served by Ofcom), the only commercial DVB-T2 Multiplex
licences in the country, with the BBC’s PSB 3 being the single non-commercial DVB-T2 Multiplex in the
UK. The DVB-T2 Multiplexes broadcast from the top 30 sites by population coverage, providing coverage
for up to approximately 73% of the UK population, and HD services are only available to viewers with HD
television (DVB-T2/MPEG-4) sets or set-top boxes. See ‘‘Industry—The Television and Broadcast Industry

_in the UK—Digital Platforms Regulation in the UK’’ and ‘‘Regulation of the Communications Industry in the_
_United Kingdom—Spectrum Regulation—Multiplex Licences’’._

_700 MHz Clearance_

The DTT platform currently uses spectrum in the 470 – 790 MHz bands. Following a November 2015
decision at the World Radiocommunication Conference, Ofcom decided to clear the 700 MHz band of
spectrum and auction it for mobile data usage. Consequently, the Group’s DTT Multiplexes that are
currently utilising the 700 MHz spectrum range will be reallocated to the 600 MHz band and below by
2020. This requires realignment of the current physical infrastructure of all DTT transmission to some
extent, with associated capital expenditures. The Group has completed a capability assessment for Ofcom
to identify the work required for the 700 MHz clearance. The Group has contracted with the major
broadcasters and Ofcom for the delivery of the programme on a cost plus basis. The Group is responsible
for the spectrum planning, network design, programme management, infrastructure changes, service
continuity, structural work, asset replacement and retuning of broadcast transmitters to enable
broadcasters to move into a lower frequency. The Group has agreed the commercial terms relating to the
clearance programme, including that the receipts are contracted until the end of the roll-out of the project
and are recognised on a time and cost basis. The Group receives cash under the contract through grant
claims that are submitted and invoiced as costs for goods and services are incurred. All 700 MHz clearance
events scheduled to the end of August 2018 have been completed successfully in line with the programme
requirements, and the programme rollout is planned to continue to May 2020. See ‘‘Regulation of the
_Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Spectrum Regulation—Multiplex Licences—700 MHz_
_Clearance Project and DVB-T2 Multiplex licences’’._

_Customers and contracts_

As a DTT Multiplex owner and licence holder, the Group generates revenue by charging customers, who
purchase capacity on its streams to broadcast on its DTT Multiplexes. Demand has recently been driven by
a combination of limited DTT Multiplex capacity and high demand for channel capacity given the
attractiveness of DTT to content providers and advertisers as a result of its broad geographic reach and
levels of uptake in the UK. Improvements in technology, such as improved compression and modulation
technologies have recently increased the number of streams available per DTT Multiplex. Across all DTT
Multiplexes in the UK, the total number of DTT channels has increased from 25 in 2002 to 113 as at
30 June 2018, and the total number of streams available on the Group’s Multiplexes has increased from 48
as at 30 June 2014 to 57 as at 30 June 2018. The Group has experienced 95% to 100% utilisation of its
DVB-T Multiplexes since July 2016, and the Group has historically been successful in creating additional
capacity through technological improvements. Further, the Group has a strong track record of rapidly
filling new available capacity, resulting in an increased number of available streams with limited churn,
given that a Multiplex switch requires a channel re-scan and risks the loss of audience during the resulting
down time. The Group expects there to be ongoing demand for DTT Multiplex capacity in line with
historical and current demand.

Customers for use of the Group’s DTT Multiplex spectrum include commercial broadcasters such as
UKTV, Channel 4, Sky, Ideal World, Sony Movie Channel and specialty shopping and news channels, all of
which purchase digital channel space on the Group’s DTT Multiplexes for fixed-term contracts typically of
three to six year durations, sometimes with customer renewal options of similar terms. Some of the
Group’s Digital Platforms contracts are inflation-linked. The top three customers of the Group’s Digital
Platforms division as at 30 June 2018 were UKTV, Channel 4 and Sky, together representing approximately
32% of the revenue of the Digital Platforms division in the year ended 30 June 2018. Other customers of
the Group’s Digital Platforms division include Ideal Shopping, Sony Pictures, Discovery, QVC, CBS and
Fox. The Group considers its Digital Platforms customers to have generally high levels of creditworthiness,
reflecting independently strong credit ratings.

In recent years, the Group has diversified its DTT Multiplex customer base so as to reduce heavy
dependency on advertising-funded channels. In the year ended 30 June 2008, 84% of the Group’s DTT
Multiplex streams were used by advertising-funded channels, while in the year ended 30 June 2018,
approximately 75% of the Group’s streams were used by advertising-funded channels, approximately 14%
were used by transactional-funded channels (such as shopping channels), or by pay/subscriber-funded
channels, approximately 9% were used by news-funded channels (such as Al Jazeera and Russia Today,
which are subsidised by overseas parent news organisations who wish to build brand presence in the UK)
and approximately 2% were used by other types of channels. Although the absolute amount of revenue

153


-----

from advertising-funded channels has increased over the period, the Group believes this diversity of the
revenue base gives the Digital Platforms business more flexibility in light of market or macroeconomic
changes, including a global downturn. The Group has also introduced partial day slots that allow
broadcasters to use a stream for particular hours at a lower cost than fully dedicated channel usage.
Examples of this include Al Jazeera, which began broadcasting on DTT in 2013 with a five hour channel
slot before adopting a full 24-hour video stream.

_Competition_

The DTT competitive landscape is highly consolidated in the UK. Apart from the Group, other owners of
national spectrum for DTT broadcasting are the BBC, D3&4 and SDN. SDN owns the only other national
commercial DTT Multiplex licence (as compared with the Group’s four national licences), and is therefore
the main commercial competitor to the Group’s Digital Platforms division, although the other Multiplex
operators (the BBC and D3&4) have allowed a small number of channels to purchase spare capacity on
their Multiplexes. SDN’s primary broadcast clients include Five, ITV and QVC. On a local level, Comux
UK owns and operates the multiplex for local TV channels but does provide limited channel capacity to
other channels and covers less than 60% of the UK population.

**_Telecoms & M2M Business Unit_**

Through the Telecoms & M2M business unit, the Group holds the largest independent (i.e. not directly or
indirectly owned by an MNO) portfolio of wireless infrastructure sites in the UK, which the Group licenses
to MNOs and other wireless network operators to allow them to provide services and coverage to their
customers. The Group had approximately 8,000 active licensed wireless sites (including contractual
options) as at 30 June 2018. A significant proportion of the Group’s active licensed wireless sites carried
MNO equipment, which the Group estimates represented approximately 21% of the total active licensed
MNO macrocell site market as at 30 June 2018. It holds a strong and difficult-to-replicate position in rural
and suburban regions where cost, economies of scale, planning permission restrictions, application regimes
with local authorities and the secure nature of site leases (given the landlord’s limited ability to terminate
the lease) would make it difficult for competitors and MNO customers to replicate the Group’s
infrastructure and footprint. In addition, the Group provides installation services for the passive
components (such as antennas and feeders) of network upgrades and roll-out on its own wireless
infrastructure sites. The Group is also positioning itself to be a leading provider of outdoor small cells
infrastructure, with access to street infrastructure in 14 London boroughs. In addition, the Group provides
indoor and outdoor DAS in the UK, with 46 live in-building systems installed in UK locations as at 30 June
2018. The Group is a leading provider of smart metering and M2M networks, with a long-term contract to
provide smart metering communication services to approximately to approximately 7 million premises with
SMETS2 devices (the remaining approximately 2.3 million homes will continue on legacy SMETS1
devices) in northern England and Scotland for electricity and gas by 2020, and a smart metering network
for Thames Water covering 3 million homes once fully deployed. A trial contract is also in place with
Anglian Water for smart metering deployment.

Revenue for the Telecoms & M2M business unit was, £317.0 million, £345.4 million and £341.3 million,
which represented, 35.9%, 36.7% and 35.5% of the Group’s total revenue for the years ended 30 June,
2016 and 2017, and 2018 respectively. The table below shows the Telecoms & M2M business unit’s revenue

_Telecoms_

The Group’s Telecoms division owns and operates a portfolio of wireless sites, which it licenses to UK
MNOs and other wireless network operators. These sites provide MNOs with elevated structures in
geographically favourable locations and in particular in rural areas, enabling their wireless customers to

154


-----

benefit from both voice and data cellular services. As a result, the Group believes its site portfolio enjoys
significant advantages from a planning perspective because the Group believes planning consent is less
likely to be granted for competing sites where there are existing large rurally located structures in the
vicinity, as a result there is limited risk of near neighbour sites, which do not exist today, and associated
churn potential emerging.

_Licensed sites portfolio_

The Telecoms division owns the physical infrastructure and offers site sharing, site operation and
maintenance and installation and decommissioning services of passive equipment for its customers. As at
30 June 2018, in the UK the Group had approximately 8,000 active licensed sites (including contractual
options), with an average occupancy ratio of 2.4 MNOs per site. The Group’s site count includes sites with
respect to which the Group has contractual options, pursuant to which it can seek to have sites transferred
to it. Such contractual options were obtained as part of a number of contracts with one of the Group’s
MNO customers. Site transfer programmes have been part of contract negotiations with the Group’s MNO
customers with the objective of achieving a mutually beneficial agreement, balancing pricing flexibility with
the opportunity to acquire further sites without additional consideration. The Group is entitled to
complete the assignment of a number of sites by 2018 and 2024. The Group had a total of approximately
16,700 marketable locations (including active licenced sites, land options and undeveloped locations with
rights, such as rooftops) as at 30 June 2018.

The Group also has a strong track record of increasing the MNO POP, from an average of 2.4 MNO POP
per site as at 30 June 2016 to an average of 2.4 MNO POP per site as at 30 June 2018. The next largest
provider of independent wireless sites, the Wireless Infrastructure Group (WIG) had approximately 1,800
shared communication infrastructure assets as at 30 June 2018 (Source: Management estimates).

In urban areas, the Group installs passive equipment on rooftops pursuant to long-term leases. In densely
populated urban areas where macro sites and rooftops are congested, the Group also installs small cells
equipment on street-level infrastructure (such as lampposts and CCTV locations) pursuant to the Group’s
concession rights. Approximately 70% of the Group’s active licensed wireless site portfolio as at 30 June
2018 was concentrated in rural and suburban areas, with the remainder in urban locations. The Group’s
rural site portfolio provides the Group with a highly defensive position in rural areas, as the development
of a competing macro-site infrastructure would require prohibitive investments in terms of land
acquisition, power provision and capital expenditures. In terms of urban infrastructure, which is evolving
through new technology such as small cells, the Group has also built up a strong position, winning rights to
street infrastructure in 14 of the 16 London boroughs which have come to market. The Group’s portfolio
of active licensed sites comprised approximately 8,000 active licensed wireless sites (including contractual
options) as at 30 June 2018. A significant proportion of the Group’s active licensed wireless sites carried
MNO equipment, which the Group estimates represented approximately 21% of all active licensed MNO
macrocell sites in the UK as at 30 June 2018, and an even higher proportion of independently operated
active licensed sites in the UK. The Group expects that urban densification underpinned by emerging
technologies such as small cells, 5G FWA and IoT applications will be a key driver of growth in this
business unit. See ‘‘Industry—The UK Telecoms Industry—Mobile Industry Outlook’’.

_Small Cells Infrastructure_

Historically, wireless infrastructure was predominantly comprised of antennas installed on macro towers
and urban rooftops. However, in order to increase capacity and therefore meet the demand for data
growth, particularly in densely-populated urban areas, the Group believes that operators are likely to
become increasingly reliant on outdoor small cells. Small cells are short range mobile phone base stations
used to increase the capacity provided from traditional towers and rooftop sites.

The Group has been developing its outdoor small cells proposition which uses lower power base stations
(owned by the MNO) to provide street level network capacity to MNOs in urban areas. For 4G networks,
outdoor small cells service high traffic and densely populated urban areas where macro sites and rooftops
are congested. For 5G networks, outdoor small cells may become the predominant provider of capacity
and to support higher spectrum bands. 16 London boroughs have awarded exclusive concessions to
network providers for the use of street-level infrastructure, such as lampposts and in some cases CCTV
columns, to install small cells equipment. Under most concessions, the Group pays the boroughs a small
one-off concession fee when the tender is won and pays the boroughs a revenue share of the street-level
furniture rent component invoiced to the MNO. The Group has been awarded 14 of these concessions

155


-----

(which extend to between 2018 and 2022), and the remaining London boroughs are expected to run
concession processes to award contracts, which may be exclusive, within the next 24 months. The Group
has also been awarded a number of other concessions with local authorities and one with NWP Street
Limited (a private company) for access to non BT phone boxes. These concessions are particularly
advantageous due to the exclusive right to use street level infrastructure in some of the UK’s largest and
highest density urban areas. Outdoor street-level furniture of this type is the most suitable for hosting small
cells because they are a suitable height, with access to power and planning permissions that is generally
easy to obtain. The Group has already contracted with two MNOs for small cells roll-out. The Group’s
small cells solution is capital expenditure ‘‘light’’, and the small cells themselves are owned and accounted
for by the MNOs in the same way as active equipment on macro sites.

Historically, the Group also participated in the WiFi market. In November 2016, the Group sold its WiFi
business to Virgin Media. The sale included venue WiFi, wholesale WiFi, roaming and media advertising.
The two businesses also signed a long-term agreement on a non-exclusive basis to continue to deploy and
operate public WiFi services in the Group’s numerous street concessions described above.

_DAS Infrastructure_

DAS infrastructure is a solution to provide indoor coverage in buildings, such as shopping malls and other
high-footfall venues. DAS are comprised of multi-operator antennas predominantly installed indoors and
connected to a central communications room where the MNO base station and associated transmission
equipment is installed.

In contrast to outdoor small cells, DAS technology is almost exclusively used to provide indoor coverage,
such as in shopping malls and airports, where it improves poor indoor coverage. The Group provides DAS
in the UK with 46 systems deployed as at 30 June 2018.

_Customers and Contracts_

The Group holds ownership of, or leasehold access to, the majority of its active licensed sites and owns the
site infrastructure providing site sharing, site operation, maintenance and installation of passive equipment
and decommissioning services for its customers. On the remainder of its active licensed sites the Group has
contractual rights (mainly under framework or management agreements) to provide these services.
However, active equipment ownership, installation, operation and performance are the responsibility of
the customer. The Group rents space on its sites under contracts to national MNOs such as Vodafone, EE,
Three UK, and O2, as well as JVs between MNOs such as MBNL (a 50/50 joint venture company owned
by Three UK and EE) and CTIL (a joint venture created by O2 and Vodafone in 2012) and a broad base of
non-MNO customers such as BT and Airwave. The Group receives revenue from space and equipment
licensing. Energy, business rates and installation costs are re-charged to the customer directly. The Group
also provides non-MNO customers, such as Airwave, BT, Virgin Media and UK Broadband, with services
which include site sharing, fibre wrapping and maintenance, and 412 MHz spectrum leasing to Airwave for
their TETRA network. The Group’s site share contract with Airwave expires in 2020 as a result of the
proposed switch off of Airwave’s Tetra network service. The Group earned site share and spectrum usage
revenues of approximately £14.3 million in the year ended 30 June 2018 from Airwave in respect of its
Tetra network service.

In recent years, the four main MNOs have continued to increase their 4G network coverage and capacity.
In turn, the Group continues to carry out a large volume of antenna and feeder upgrade projects for those
MNOs or their JVs, resulting in high installation services revenues during the three-year period ended
30 June 2018. The Group had completed approximately 8,200 4G upgrades across Arqiva-managed sites
up to 30 June 2018 since the roll-out began in 2014. In March 2018, Ofcom publicly announced that all
four MNOs had met all of the coverage obligations they were required to meet by 31 December 2017. The
Group played a key role in helping the UK MNOs meet these obligations.

Under contracts signed in 2008 and 2011, an MNO JV is obligated to transfer to 3,000 sites to the Group.
It is the Group’s responsibility to complete the assignment. The Group benefits from the ability to
co-locate on the sites, and the deal increased the Group’s relationship with the MNO JV as the Group
significantly enlarged the proportion of utilised sites under their ownership, further reinforcing the
Group’s critical position within the MNO JV’s infrastructure.

The Group’s Telecoms division had over £1.3 billion of revenue under contract as at 30 June 2018,
equivalent to nearly four times the division’s revenue for the year ended 30 June 2018. Substantial

156


-----

contracts with the MNOs and their JVs include a contract with MBNL, Three UK and EE, and an
additional contract with EE, with both contracts running until December 2018, a contract with T-Mobile
running until 2024 and also a contract running until 2024 with CTIL, Vodafone and O2. Together these
contracts represented the large majority of Group site share revenue in the year ended 30 June 2018. The
Group’s MNO clients are backed by substantial parent companies such as BT (EE), Hutchison Whampoa
(Three UK) and Telef´onica (O2). The Group’s Telecoms contracts typically have terms of seven to ten
years and are inflation-linked. Historically, the Group’s MNO customers have shown low annual churn
rates, with annual churn rates of 0.5, 1.7 and 1.7 in the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018,
respectively, and most of the main contracts contain restrictions on the number of sites a customer can
terminate over a given time period. The Group’s contract with MBNL has been extended for a further
twelve months (to 31 December 2019) to allow time for renegotiation, and the EE contract extension is
under discussion. As part of the MBNL contract renegotiation, MBNL is running a competitive tendering
process for 1,375 sites currently being provided by Arqiva. Management expects a successful outcome for
the MBNL contract renegotiation.

The Group’s current contracts in the small cells business serve both landlords and network operators. The
Group focuses on acquiring rights to access assets (e.g. lampposts) in areas where the demand for cellular
capacity is high. The Group currently has two MNOs as customers for small cells and is discussing
potential opportunities with others.

The Group’s key landlord DAS contracts include Luton Airport, Manchester Arndale, Linklaters, the
Glasgow Subway, Bluewater Shopping Centre and Canary Wharf, with contracts expiring between
December 2018 and 2027.

_Competition_

The Group is the largest provider of independent wireless sites in the UK, having approximately 8,000
active licensed sites (including contractual options) as at 30 June 2018. Competing independent providers
of wireless sites are fragmented. As at 30 June 2018 the Group believes it had approximately four times the
number of active sites compared to its three nearest independent wireless sites competitors in the UK, the
largest of which is an independent infrastructure provider WIG, with approximately 1,800 active licensed
sites as at 30 June 2018 (Source: Management estimates).

MNOs own or directly lease a large percentage of their sites. The total number of sites in the market
(including those owned by the MNOs themselves) has decreased as MNOs form JVs and enter into site
sharing or RAN sharing agreements among themselves to decrease network costs. See ‘‘Industry—The UK
_Telecoms Industry—Wireless Telecom Infrastructure in the UK’’. The Group plays a critical role in the_
consolidation process by allowing the MNOs to use a single site for equipment sharing purposes
post-consolidation. However, further MNO consolidation appears unlikely in the near-term following the
recently blocked merger of O2 and Three, but government policy regarding coverage and network
performance could be relaxed in the medium-term.

When MNOs make significant investments in their networks (such as the deployment of 5G), they are
making a scale investment in the installation of active equipment (such as a base station) and passive
equipment (such as an antenna). MNOs may take this opportunity to redesign their network footprint to
minimise ongoing costs and ensure security of tenure for the lifetime of their assets, particularly when
passive infrastructure upgrades (including tower strengthening or replacement) are also required.

Small cells technology offers alternative structures in urban areas, but is used primarily for covering
specific high density areas. The Group has had a successful track record in winning small cells
infrastructure business, having been awarded 14 of the 16 London boroughs street infrastructure tenders.
The Group’s key competitors in the small cells area include JCDecaux, Transport for London, CTIL and
BT. The Group currently has contracts with two MNOs for the provision of small cells and is discussing
potential opportunities with the two others.

The Group is also the primary independent provider of DAS in the UK, with 46 systems in a number of
prime locations as at 30 June 2018 and a growing pipeline of landlord funded opportunities. The Group’s
key competitors in the DAS area include CTIL, WIG and self-provision by the MNOs. While MNOs have
the largest number of DAS in the UK, these DAS are primarily dedicated for the MNOs’ corporate
accounts.

-----

_M2M_

The Group has been an early participant in the development of M2M infrastructure in the UK and is a
leading provider of smart metering and M2M networks, with a long-term contract to provide smart energy
metering communication services to approximately seven million premises with SMETS2 devices (the
remaining approximately 2.3 million homes will continue on legacy SMETS1 devices) in northern England
and Scotland for electricity and gas by 2020, and smart water metering for Thames Water covering three
million homes once fully deployed. A trial contract with Anglian Water for smart water metering
deployment is also in place.

_Smart Energy Metering_

Smart energy metering is a government initiative to ensure that every home in the UK is offered a smart
meter by 2020. Smart meters link to in-home displays, which enables consumers to see how much energy
they are using and monitor costs. Smart meters also communicate directly with energy suppliers, which
allows suppliers to provide consumers with more accurate bills, thus removing the need for manual meter
readings and estimated billing. The core communications technology for the project has been successfully
deployed internationally, and is capable of broadening the application of smart services, including to
locations deep inside buildings that other communications technologies have struggled to reach.

The Group has been building a smart metering communication network in the north of England and
Scotland as part of a 15-year contract signed in September 2013 with the DCC, a body licensed by statute
and backed by the utility companies. Under its contract with the DCC, the Group earns revenue for the
build-out of a smart metering network from set-up charges, which are milestone based payments, including
design, build and testing milestones, related to the network roll-out. In addition, the Group earns revenue
from network availability charges and related fixed operational charges as the smart metering network
enters operational service, which the Group is able to charge throughout the lifetime of the contract.
Finally, the Group earns revenue from monthly asset charges, which are triggered upon accepted delivery
of the communication hubs, and monthly maintenance charges, which are triggered upon activation of
communication hubs, and both of which the Group is able to charge throughout the lifetime of the
contract. While the Group provides the network infrastructure, the meters and communications hubs are
owned and installed by the energy suppliers. In November 2016, the DCC service entered operational
service throughout the UK following the completion of integration testing. The Arqiva network is
successfully transmitting and receiving test messages between DCC users (the energy companies), and
consumer electricity and gas meters. The roll-out of the service to consumers’ homes is expected to
accelerate over the next 12 months following service user testing. The roll-out of the Arqiva network
continues to evolve and has achieved 97.75% coverage of premises within the agreed coverage zone as at
the date of this Offering Memorandum, in line with the Group’s contractual commitments. Roll-out is
expected to be substantially complete by 2020, with the network expected to cover 99.5% of all homes in
the agreed coverage zone. The Group has made significant capital expenditure investment over the past
three years. However, capital expenditures are financed upfront under the Group’s commercial terms with
the DCC, and any change request payments are pre-paid against milestones. As at 30 June 2018,
specification change requests accounted for approximately 23% of the Group’s contracted smart metering
revenues. Payment under the contract is governed by an established regulatory framework (the Smart
Energy Code), under which the DCC directly charges distribution network operators and energy suppliers
for charges applied by the Group. As at 30 June 2018, approximately 60% of the contract investment had
been paid by the DCC and the remaining half will be paid by the DCC in the form of set-up charges
(through the end of the contract) and additional charges (to June 2020). Network operators and energy
suppliers are responsible for the bad debts of consumers and failure by a network operator or energy
supplier to pay the DCC results in costs being assumed by other network operators and energy suppliers in
the industry. The DCC began paying set-up costs to the Group upon the achievement of agreed milestones
associated with the network roll-out. The set-up charges are paid over a period with the start date being
defined against a milestone. The DCC also commenced paying fixed network operating charges in
November 2016. When additional charges arise in respect of the supply and support maintenance of
communication hubs and change requests, such charges are passed on to the DCC.

_Smart Water Metering_

Smart water metering is an industry-led initiative to install smart water meters in homes, with a focus on
‘‘water stressed areas’’. There are no national targets set by the government or the Water Services
Regulation Authority (Ofwat) for the installation of water meters in homes in the UK, but suppliers in

158


-----

‘‘water stressed’’ areas are required to offer meters to customers to limit the number of reservoirs and
desalination plants. The use of smart meters provides benefits including faster leak detection, enhanced
supply and demand planning, better capital investment targeting and lower consumption. It is estimated
that smart metered customers will use 17% less water than customers who do not have a smart meter
(Source: National Infrastructure Commission). While the water meter market is less developed as
compared to gas and electricity (for example, only ten of the 24 UK water companies have started roll-outs
or trials or have announced trials for smart metering), the Group believes this is a potential growth
opportunity in a market in which it has already established a strong position. The National Infrastructure
Commission recommended in 2018 that, ‘‘the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
should enable companies to implement compulsory metering beyond water stressed areas by the 2030s, by
amending regulations before the end of 2019 and requiring all companies to consider systematic roll out of
smart meters as a first step in a concerted campaign to improve water efficiency.’’

The top five water providers cover more than 50% of UK households, with Thames Water being the
largest. In March 2015, the Group signed a contract with Thames Water for the provision of smart
metering fixed network infrastructure and associated water meters that enable the collection, management
and transfer of metering data from households. The contract is for an initial six-year term that is
extendable up to a total of sixteen years. The service is expected to cover three million homes once fully
deployed. Under its contract with Thames Water, the Group provides fixed network services,
subcontracting to Sensus UK Systems Limited (Sensus) to supply water meters, software and services,
which the Group sells on to Thames Water. The Group only builds sites as ordered by the customer
(i.e. the network build is not speculative). The Group earns revenue for the network roll-out on
completion of certain milestones and sites with Thames Water funding the associated build costs as well as
for the supply of water meters, software and services. In addition, the Group incurs revenue from ongoing
network service charges. The service is currently live, delivering 6 million meter readings per day, and over
307,000 meters had been installed as at 30 June 2018. The Group purchases the meters from Sensus and
Thames Water installs the meters, together with the rest of the equipment, in its customers’ homes.
Thames Water has decided to accelerate deployment of the smart metering network, which will help to
achieve coverage in London earlier than originally planned in order to realise the benefits of extended
coverage sooner. The Group has been instructed to deploy the full network coverage across London and it
is targeting completion by the end of 2018.

In July 2016, the Group won a four-year contract with Anglian Water for the delivery and monitoring of a
smart water metering fixed network trial to facilitate the deployment and operation of 7,500 new meters. In
August 2017, the pilot was subsequently expanded to approximately 20,000 meters in total by adding a
second trial area for approximately 2 million homes in its supply area. As at 30 June 2018, 17,200 of the
anticipated full complement of meters had been installed. The Group believes it is well-positioned to win
the full Anglian Water contract. In the future, the Group intends to leverage its success with Thames Water
and Anglian Water to work with other water companies who have identified plans in relation to smart
water metering.

**_Satellite & Media Business Unit_**

The Group provides international managed services to the video and broadcast industry, where the Group
believes there is an advantage to outsource to a scale provider that can leverage shared assets and
expertise.

The Group’s Satellite & Media business unit offers media management (including playout), managed
networks for international contribution and distribution, UK DTH services and satellite data
communications services to blue-chip customers such as NBCU, Turner, Canal+ and BT ESPN. The
Group has been increasingly focussed on higher-profit margin services, and has exited lower margin
market segments.

159


-----

The Group is the primary independent owner of UK DTH uplink distribution services, provided via
transponder capacity on the Eutelsat 28E, F and G and SES Astra 2 satellites, which are leased on a range
of commercial terms (the majority of which include short- and medium-term flexibility with the minority of
transponders on fixed leases through to 2025 and 2028). In order to offer a comprehensive solution, as at
30 June 2018, the Satellite & Media business unit’s infrastructure included five teleports, more than 80
satellite uplink dishes, an international terrestrial fibre information network, television studios and
approximately 1.4 GHz of leased capacity on more than 30 satellites globally across all other product areas.
The Group’s independent teleport network consists of five teleports in the UK, located at WinchesterCrawley Court, Winchester-Morn Hill (an unmanned back-up site), Chalfont (one of only four teleports
accredited to Tier 4 globally), Bedford, and Ipswich (Martlesham—which provides direct access to markets
in the Middle East and North Africa), together comprising more than 80 uplink dishes. The Group also
procures third party ground-based teleport services in Hong Kong, Australia and the United States where a
line of sight to a satellite cannot be achieved from its UK assets. This comprehensive network of
infrastructure allows the Group to satisfy the international distribution requirements for a number of its
major customers (for example, by using its fibre network to transport content from the United States and
then broadcasting it onward to Europe and elsewhere). As at 30 June 2018, approximately 46% of the
Group’s Satellite & Media revenue was transacted in sterling and the balance was a combination of Euros
(44%) and US dollars (9%).

Through the Group’s media management services, the Group delivers more than 100 channels of
outsourced content, distributing over 125,000 hours of live sport content per year, processing over
20,000 hours of video-on-demand per year and managing approximately 2,000 hours of content per day
and 26 languages of content via playout. The Group is one of the top two suppliers of UK playout and
media management services.

For customers needing international distribution, the Group offers comprehensive managed network
solutions, including teleport services, satellite capacity management, fibre connectivity management,
disaster recovery solutions and services for occasional use and events. The Group is a leading European
supplier of these services.

The Group’s Satellite & Media uplink services consist of the transmission of a broadcast signal from a
teleport to a satellite, while downlink services consist of the reception of a broadcast signal that is
transmitted from a satellite to a teleport and turnaround consists of downlinking a satellite signal and
instantaneously uplinking it again, either to transmit a signal beyond the range of a single satellite or to
change the signal from one transmission bandwidth to another. In addition, the Group offers occasional
use of teleport space and fibre for the distribution of live events, including a contract for IMG Premier
League Football global distribution.

The Group has been expanding its IP-based solutions, including the launch of IP streaming products in
2015, with which the Group aims to retain its existing customers and gaining new clients. As at 30 June
2018, the Group had £2.6 million of capital expenditure covering the following IP related products: IP
streaming, IP contribution, video-on-demand, remote and edge playout. The Group is also building out its
scalable and secure IP-based media service routing platform. The platform will offer customers greater
flexibility, as it is controlled by a ‘‘drag and drop’’ service orchestration system used to reduce costs,
improve service delivery and improve efficiency.

The Group is a leading provider of satellite uplink infrastructure and satellite distribution services in the
UK in terms of the number of channels available for UK DTH satellite broadcast, with an estimated
outsourced market share of approximately 48% of fully managed channels as at 30 June 2018. As at
30 June 2018, the Group delivered over 200 TV channels to approximately 10 million homes in the UK,
making it the largest provider of UK DTH services. The Group has continued to see channel growth
during the period under review. In the year ended 30 June 2018, the Group launched six SD channels and
four new HD channels.

The Group provides a number of services for the satellite data communications market, and is the leading
UK data teleport operator in terms of estimated revenue generated per independent UK teleport.

The Group has sales offices and representatives in the United States, France, Dubai, Singapore and Hong
Kong, which the Group believes will serve as a platform to capitalise on international opportunities. Going
forward, virtualisation (utilising developments in IT storage and computer technology to run virtualised
systems, in either the public or private cloud) may make new markets and geographies accessible to the
Group by enabling the shift from a hardware-based model to a software-based model. In addition, the

Group’s ‘‘pay-as-you-go’’ model does not require the Group to invest or pre-pay for infrastructure, as was
typical with traditional broadcast and media technologies.

Revenue from the Satellite & Media business unit was £144.6 million, £146.9 million and £133.5 million,
which represented 16.4%, 15.6% and 13.9% of the Group’s total revenue for the years ended 30 June 2016,
2017 and 2018, respectively.

The Group’s UK DTH revenues are primarily driven by the volume of channels being distributed to the
Sky platform and the volume of Mb bandwidth required to distribute the channels. Revenues are derived
on a price per Mb basis. The volume of Mb required to distribute the channel depends on a number of
factors including, but not limited to, the broadcast channel type (SD, HD or UHD), the complexity of the
content (e.g. low dynamic news picture versus high dynamic sports picture) and the quality of broadcast
required by the broadcaster (e.g. an SD channel could require approximately 2 to 6 Mb, a HD channel
could require approximately 9 to 12 Mb).

_Customers and contracts_

The Satellite & Media business unit has a large and diverse customer base, and no single customer was
responsible for more than 10% of revenue for the satellite business in the year ended 30 June 2018. For the
year ended 30 June 2018, the top 15 clients accounted for 51% of the Satellite & Media business unit’s
revenues. Of these top 15 clients, six are shared Arqiva accounts. The following table shows the Satellite &
Media business unit’s services and key customers:

Among the Group’s customers are most of the Tier 1 international broadcasters, such as Canal Plus,
Discovery, Turner, NBC Universal and ITV, as well as Tier 2 and Tier 3 customers in the UK and overseas.
Typical contract lengths are three to five years with a historic gross renewal rate of approximately 90% with
existing customers and low default rates. Gross churn, which is defined as annual revenue lost on contracts
not renewed divided by revenue pre-renewals, has averaged approximately 10% for UK DTH, managed
networks and media management for the years ended 30 June 2017 and 2018. Approximately 38% of the
Group’s Satellite & Media contracts have price increases linked to RPI.

Since December 2017, the Group has reached an agreement for the renewal of over 260 Mbits of UK DTH
capacity across major customers, including BT Sport, Turner, Sony, NBCU and Freesat. The Group
believes this further reinforces its position as the leading premium service provider of UK DTH services.

The Group has also recently secured a number of new international contracts within the Satellite & Media
business unit. In March 2016, the Group was selected by Al Jazeera Media Network (AJMN) to provide its
global teleport and satellite distribution services. Over the course of a long-term agreement, the Group is
responsible for the distribution of AJMN’s flagship news channels Al Jazeera Arabic and Al Jazeera
English to popular global platforms. In December 2016, the Group entered into a contract with IMG
Premier League Football for global distribution of live football events. In March 2017, the Group won a
contract with Sony Asia for connectivity, multiplexing, uplink and satellite capacity, and the Group
renewed its contracts with MultiChoice for variety of services including compression and teleport services
as well as fibre networks. The Group believes that these contracts give it the opportunity to demonstrate its
capabilities in the Middle East, Asia and globally and may enable it to expand its customer base. The
Group has also recently secured a contract with Canal+ to design, build and operate a new DTT platform
in sub-Saharan Africa. The Group believes this contract is scalable to expand or add SD and HD channels,
and to extend services to additional francophone West African countries.

In 2018, the Group secured its first significant virtualised services contract with a US Tier 1 broadcaster
which has launched new direct-to-consumer OTT service. As part of this contract, the Group will provide a
hybrid of core managed teleport and fibre services, along with a highly scalable IP streaming service for
hundreds of live sports events each year. The use of public cloud services allows the Group to provide high
levels of service automation and commercial flexibility.

_Competition_

The Group’s major UK competitor in the provision of satellite telecommunications and uplink services is
Globecast. The BBC buys transponder capacity directly for its own purposes and Sky sources capacity for
itself and for many of its channels and does not currently resell this capacity. Another of the Group’s
competitors in the satellite and media space is MX1, a global media services provider wholly owned by SES
(a communications satellite owner and operator based in Luxembourg).

As at 30 June 2018, the Group believes it had a 48% outsourced market share of fully managed channels in
the UK. The Group’s main competitors in the Satellite & Media space are Sky, Globecast, Babcock and
SES. As of June 2018, the Group estimates Sky had a market share of approximately 27% of the managed
channels (excluding self-managed proprietary channels), Globecast had approximately 20% of the market
share, and SES and Babcock had a combined market share of approximately 5%.

The Group provides satellite and media services across a wide array of product offerings. Various global
competitors compete with the Satellite & Media business unit in these product areas, but the overall
competitive landscape for satellite and media services is fragmented along the value chain. The Group
offers a full range of products and solutions either on an integrated or standalone basis. The Group
competes globally, but has a focus on the UK and Western Europe.

**Employees**

In the year ended 30 June 2018, the Group employed an average of 2,071 full-time equivalent persons. The
Group works in partnership with BECTU, the UK’s primary media and entertainment trade union, on all
issues relating to employment, organisation change and terms & conditions. Despite addressing
challenging issues over recent years (including the closure of the Defined Benefit Pension Scheme to
future accrual, the harmonisation of terms & conditions, and organisation restructuring), the Group has
experienced no significant employee relations or industrial relations issues. As of 30 June 2018,
approximately 36% of the Group’s employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, including
through BECTU.

As part of the Group’s disposal of its WiFi business, its payphone assets/business (NWP Street Limited)
and Secure Solutions, the Group transferred approximately 200 employees, which had a significant impact
on the total headcount of the Group in the years ending 30 June 2016 and 2017. The table below shows the
average number of full-time employees for the years ended 30 June 2016, 2017 and 2018 in each of the
Group’s three business units and Corporate Support (which covers finance, IT, legal and strategy functions,
human resources and business development for the Group):

(3) Excludes freelancers and outsourced employees.

**Properties**

The Group’s operational headquarters are located near Winchester, UK, with the corporate headquarters
based in London. The Group has a further 44 manned sites across the UK.

**_Communications Sites_**

The Group’s ownership interests in communications sites include freehold ownership, leases created by
long-term ground lease agreements, easements and licences or rights-of-way granted by government
entities.

163


-----

**_Terrestrial Broadcast_**

The Terrestrial Broadcast business unit has a large portfolio of sites for the transmission of DTT and radio
and also operates the Group’s licensed Multiplexes and delivers related engineering projects. The key
equipment required to provide end-to-end network services to both DTT and radio broadcasters are mast
and towers, antennae (both main and reserve), transmitters (used to produce signals for distribution),
programme input equipment (used to process video and audio signals) and combiners (used to combine
outputs from different channels for broadcast via the antenna network). Of the Group’s 1,154 DTT sites as
at 30 June 2018, approximately 80 are main or major stations and the remainder are smaller relay sites.
The Group owns a freehold interest in approximately 40% of its total DTT sites (60% for its main stations
and major sites), whereas it leases the remaining 60% of sites (40% for its main stations and major sites)
primarily on medium- to long-term leases. The average initial lease length for the Group’s DTT sites is
30 years, although the average initial lease length is slightly shorter (23 years) for its main stations and
major sites. Many of the Group’s DTT sites are valuable for multiple uses—featuring telecommunications,
radio and M2M equipment.

A typical site consists of a compound enclosing the site, a tower structure and one or more equipment
shelters that house a variety of transmitting, receiving and switching equipment. Tower structures are
typically guyed towers, as tall as 350 metres, or small monopole/tubular structures, often used to address
space or aesthetic constraints in more densely populated areas. The site portfolio also contains the UK’s
largest free-standing concrete structure at 330 metres based in Yorkshire.

**_Telecoms_**

Of the approximately 8,000 active licensed communications sites (including contractual options) in the
Group’s portfolio as at 30 June 2018, approximately 91% are located on land that the Group leases but
does not own. Ground leases for land underlying the Group’s sites generally have medium to long initial
terms. Approximately 90% of the leased portfolio had an original term longer than ten years, and
approximately 60% of the leased portfolio had an initial term longer than 20 years. See ‘‘Regulation of the
_Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Site Regulation—Landlord and Tenant Act’’. In any given_
year, a number of leases will be approaching renewal, and the Group takes a balanced approached to
managing site retention. The Group manages an ‘‘asset risk’’ register to ensure that a tailored strategy is
used in lease renewals that addresses levels of risk on each site, and progression of the lease negotiations is
managed on a prioritised basis. In addition, the ‘‘powers’’ granted to certain Group members by Ofcom
under the electronic communications code, which allow operators to benefit from certain exemptions
under Town and Country Planning Legislation, also provide a form of security of tenure on leasehold and
licensed sites. The Group estimates that approximately two thirds of its leases benefit from the protections
of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954. The right of access to land and the protection from eviction
afforded to telecommunications operators who have been awarded the ‘‘code powers’’ set out in
Schedule 2 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 were extended by the Communications Act 2003. This
enables network service providers and broadcasters and their network service providers to also be awarded
‘‘code powers’’ in relation to electronic communications apparatus put on, under or over land. In
particular, code powers limit a landlord’s ability to require removal of electronic communication apparatus
without an adjudicative process and protect the Group’s ability to retain sites that are expiring and under
negotiation for renewal. This option will be deployed as appropriate and only when required. In general,
lease renewal rates during the period under review have been high, with a site churn rate of fewer than ten
sites per year over the last three years. Within the next five years, approximately 48% of leases will expire.
Approximately 22% of the Group’s leases will not expire for 30 years or more. See ‘‘Regulation of the
_Communications Industry in the United Kingdom—Communications Act—Code Powers’’._

**_Satellite_**

Each of the Group’s five satellite teleport sites consist of multiple satellite antennas arranged in an array
over a single site, plus supporting infrastructure which allows for control and maintenance of the antennas.
A typical site consists of a compound enclosing the site with antennas/dishes ranging from small
(1.2 metres) to large (16.4 metres) structures (9 metres is the most commonly used size) with several
equipment cabins and a master control centre. In addition, the Group has two playout facilities near
London, one co-located playout centre at one of the Group’s teleports (with direct access to global
distribution network of fibre and satellite connectivity) and a studio complex and production facilities at
one of the Group’s media centres to complement live transmission capabilities. The Group has also a data
room, downlink antenna and monitoring control room in France.

As at 30 June 2018, the Group also held the following non-revenue generating spectrum licence:

**Licence** **Licence Expiry Date** **Proposed Application**

28 GHz . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In perpetuity 5G

**Insurance and Risk Management**

The Group maintains insurance coverage of £100 million for public and product liability, up to
£100 million for property, £50 million for employers’ liability, £50 million for terrorism and £20 million for
professional indemnity, indemnity levels which are customary for the Group’s industries. The Group also
maintains other types of insurance that are typical of the Group’s industries and which it believes to be
adequate. The Group’s insurance policies are subject to customary deductibles and exclusions. See ‘‘Risk
_Factors—Risks relating to the Group’s business and industry—The Group’s infrastructure assets may be_
_affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events or damage’’._

The Group adopts an Enterprise Risk Management approach, which conforms to the intent of ISO31000,
enables the Group to meet its corporate objectives and forms an important part of good corporate
governance. Risk management is a structured approach for taking informed decisions on managing risk,
establishing a risk aware culture and encouraging the discussion of business issues. This extends from
project risk, through to programme, and operational risks which are consolidated at business unit level and
reported to senior management and the Audit & Risk Committee. This approach incorporates an
Operational Resilience Board which focuses on Information Security, Quality, Business Continuity,
Physical Security and Health & Safety. Managing risk and ensuring resilience in these areas is a core
responsibility of management at all levels. In addition, the Group has a formal Health & Safety audit plan
in force with formal risk assessments being carried out, and documented with relevant Safe Systems of
Work.

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, the Group may be a party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of
the normal operations of the Group’s business. On 23 December 2016, the Group issued proceedings in
the German district court of Bonn against a former third party satellite capacity supplier in respect of
alleged breach of certain contracts. The Group is claiming damages plus interest and costs. The Group lost
at first instance on a point of interpretation of the German law of damages. The Group has since taken

165


-----

expert advice and decided to proceed to appeal to the Higher Regional Court of Cologne. The appeal is
scheduled to take place during November 2018. Other than as mentioned here, there are no material legal
proceedings outstanding as at the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**Trademarks**

The Group has obtained trademark registrations for the name ‘‘Arqiva’’ in the UK, the United States and
the EU. The initial terms of the Group’s registered trademarks (held directly or indirectly) are for at least
ten years from the date of filing and are renewable thereafter. The Group’s trademark registrations were
recently renewed and extended, with the latest running until 2025.

**Regulation**

For regulations the Group believes are material to its business, see ‘‘Regulation of the Communications
_Industry in the United Kingdom’’._

**Environmental Policies**

The Group is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations
impose increasingly stringent environmental obligations regarding, among other things, radiation
emissions, the protection of employee health and safety, noise and historical preservation. The Group has
environmental policies the Group believes are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and
typical for the Group’s industries. See ‘‘Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Group’s business and industry—
_The Group is subject to stringent regulation relating to environmental protection and health, and if the Group is_
_found to have not been in compliance with any portion of such applicable rules, the Group could be exposed to_
_fines, increased costs, or sanctions, or could be liable for damages to third parties’’._

**REGULATION OF THE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM**

**Overview**

The Group’s business is subject to extensive regulation. Key areas of regulation relevant to the Group
include:

- Undertakings given to the Competition Commission (now its successor, the Competition and Markets
Authority (CMA)) supervised and enforced by the Office of the Adjudicator—Broadcast Transmission
Services (OTA-BTS) and the CMA;

- communications regulation under the Communications Act 2003 (the **Communications Act) and**
related regulations, supervised and enforced by Ofcom, the UK’s independent communications
regulator;

- spectrum licence regulation including under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (the WT Act) and the
Broadcasting Act 1996 (the Broadcasting Act); and

- regulation relating to the Group’s sites and infrastructure.

**Competition Regulation**

**_The Undertakings_**

_Overview_

As a result of historical reasons related to competition, the Group is subject to competition undertakings.
In its present form, the Arqiva group was formed from the 2008 acquisition by Macquarie UK Broadcast
Ventures Limited (MUBVL) of the NGW group. MUBVL and NGW both provided broadcast transmission
services to terrestrial television and radio broadcasters and Multiplex operators as well as infrastructure
systems and services to mobile network operators (MNOs) or fixed network operators. The acquisition was
reviewed by the UK Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, the UK competition
authorities at the time. On 11 March 2008, the Competition Commission concluded that the acquisition
might have been expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition in the market for transmission
services, which includes the provision of managed transmission services (MTS) and network access (NA) to
television broadcasters and certain radio broadcasters within the UK. Given this conclusion, Arqiva,
MUBVL and its parent entities gave undertakings to the Competition Commission (the **Undertakings).**
The Competition Commission accepted the Undertakings on 1 September 2008 and approved the
acquisition. The Undertakings include:

- in respect of contracts existing at the time the Undertakings were given:

- a requirement to provide enhanced service availability levels for services consisting of transmission
services provided to a radio or television Multiplex operator or broadcaster;

- the introduction of a ‘‘super credit’’ service credit regime as an alternative to the exercise of
termination or step-in rights; and

- the introduction of percentage discounts on the contract price for transmission services;

- provisions governing new contracts for transmission services including contract terms and pricing (see
‘‘—Undertakings—undertaking to provide NA’’ and ‘‘—Undertakings—undertaking to provide MTS’’);

- a re-affirmation of the requirement to provide NA to any provider of transmission services (on fair,
reasonable and cost-orientated terms) (see ‘‘—Undertakings—undertaking to provide NA’’);

- additional provisions upon renewal of existing agreements:

    - rights of renewal for radio customers in relation to existing contracts on the same terms and
conditions (as amended as a result of the Undertakings) to the extent relating to
transmission services; and

    - the requirement to grant certain of its television and radio customers the right to purchase
transmitter equipment dedicated to that customer’s agreement upon exit of the agreement
and, if taken up, a plan to facilitate transfer of ownership and control of such equipment to
the customer;

167


-----

- a requirement to maintain appropriate accounting records to enable Arqiva to prepare (and have
audited) annual statements of revenues, costs and assets employed for transmission services;

- restrictions on the use of confidential information and a requirement to publish an information
security strategy detailing Arqiva’s principles for access to and use of confidential information
(recognising that Arqiva’s own Multiplex business could be in competition with that of its broadcast
transmission customers);

- a requirement to report monthly on the integration of NGW in relation to the planned cessation of
analogue terrestrial television broadcasting services and the transition to all digital terrestrial
television (DTT) broadcasting services in the UK (the digital switchover); and

- a requirement to report and provide information to the Competition Commission to allow it (and
Ofcom and an independent appointed adjudicator) to monitor or enforce compliance with the
undertakings.

Arqiva is subject to the Undertakings in respect of both MTS and NA with respect to terrestrial broadcast.
The Undertakings remain in effect, applying both to existing and new contracts that the Group enters into
to provide services to television and radio broadcasters and Multiplex operators, and to the related
infrastructure, in a number of ways. The Undertakings are now enforced by the OTA-BTS and the CMA,
as successor to the Competition Commission.

_Enforcement_

Under the Enterprise Act, if the CMA considers that an Undertaking has not been, is not being or will not
be fulfilled, then the CMA may make an order to remedy, mitigate or prevent the Substantial Lessening of
Competition (SLC) concerned and to remedy or prevent any adverse effects which have resulted from, or
may be expected to result from the SLC.

Such an order may contain anything permitted by the Enterprise Act, which includes (i) prohibiting
anything the CMA may consider to be (a) discrimination between persons in the prices charged for
services or (b) a preference in respect of the supply of goods or services; (ii) prohibiting charging prices
different to those in any published list or notification; (iii) regulating the prices that can be charged for
goods or services; (iv) prohibiting or restricting the acquisition of all or any part of the undertakings or
assets of another person’s business; or (v) providing for the compulsory division of any business (for
example by way of a sale of any part of the undertakings or assets of a business).

To date, Arqiva has not been subject to any enforcement procedures in respect of the Undertakings.

_Adjudicator (OTA-BTS)_

The Undertakings provide for the appointment of an adjudicator and setting up of the OTA-BTS, who is
required to make periodic reports to the CMA (copied to Ofcom) including the OTA-BTS’s views on the
performance of Arqiva in complying with the Undertakings. In each of the quarterly reports issued by the
OTA-BTS to date, the OTA-BTS has confirmed that the performance of Arqiva continues to be
satisfactory.

The OTA-BTS has certain powers to give directions in respect of Reference Offers and to resolve disputes
in relation to Arqiva’s obligations under the Undertakings. To date, no disputes have been referred to the
OTA-BTS for resolution under their dispute resolution powers.

_Undertakings—undertaking to provide NA_

The terms, conditions and charges pursuant to which Arqiva will provide NA under a new transmission
agreement are set out in the relevant reference offer for services (a NA Reference Offer). In preparing a
NA Reference Offer Arqiva must (i) comply with the provisions in the Undertakings regarding charges
(see further below), (ii) comply with any direction and have regard to any guidance issued by the OTA-BTS
and (iii) have regard to the principles relevant to that type of Reference Offer set out in the Undertakings
(Principles). The Principles set out, at a high level, the terms and conditions of each type of Reference
Offer (whether DTT or radio) and include (among other things) provision for liquidated damages to be
payable by Arqiva for any station delivered late (subject to appropriate carve outs), an indemnity in favour
of Arqiva for any content related liability, a service credit and super credit regime and the warranties to be
provided by Arqiva.

168


-----

With regard to charges, Arqiva must be able to demonstrate (to the OTA-BTS) that each charge payable
for NA (i) is reasonably derived from the costs of provision allowing recovery of common costs and
including an appropriate return (being currently a fixed rate of return of 7.71% WACC (real pre-tax) on a
pre-2015 regulated asset base and 7.5% WACC (real pre-tax) on post-2015 new capital assets), (ii) is in
compliance with any direction and has regard to any guidance issued by the OTA-BTS and (iii) has regard
to the Principles. With respect to charges the Principles provide that (i) the forecast costs of provision are
only to include those costs that Arqiva will reasonably and efficiently incur in providing the NA,
(ii) electricity charges will be passed through at cost, and (iii) where actual costs of provision are higher
than forecasted costs the charges may not be increased (unless as a result of a change in the specification
or any other matter outside of Arqiva’s control) but where actual costs are lower, an appropriate gainshare
mechanism is to be applied. There are further provisions relating to the terms, conditions and charges
applicable to MTS set out in an MTS Reference Offer (an MTS Reference Offer) (see ‘‘—Undertakings—
_undertaking to provide MTS’’ below)._

Existing radio customers may elect to renew their existing contracts on the same terms and conditions, as
amended in accordance with the Undertakings (see ‘‘—The Undertakings—Overview’’). Alternatively,
where a new agreement is entered into, the customer has the option to adopt the terms of its existing
agreement, rather than the terms of the relevant Reference Offer (other than the provisions relating to
charges which are to be determined in accordance with the Undertakings).

The OTA-BTS has certain powers to give directions in respect of Reference Offers and to resolve disputes
in relation to Arqiva’s obligations under the Undertakings. To date, no disputes have been referred to the
OTA-BTS for resolution under their dispute resolution powers.

_Undertakings—undertaking to provide MTS_

Pursuant to the Undertakings, Arqiva undertook to provide MTS to any Multiplex operator for the
purposes of providing analogue and/or digital terrestrial broadcasting transmission services in the UK to
deliver broadcast content to end users. Such MTS must be on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory
terms, conditions and charges and in accordance with the relevant MTS Reference Offer. This permits the
Group to establish prices at market levels, provided the Group can demonstrate to the OTA-BTS that the
Group’s pricing is consistent with market standard rates.

Under the Undertakings, (i) charges for MTS are to be capable of being demonstrated to be (a) reasonably
derived from the costs of provision allowing an appropriate mark up for the recovery of common costs and
including an appropriate return and (b) in compliance with any direction and with regard to any guidance
issued by the OTA-BTS; and (ii) the costs of electricity are to be passed through to the customer with no
additional mark up. These provisions also apply to the NA element of any MTS offered or provided by
Arqiva under new transmission agreements.

The OTA-BTS has certain powers to give directions in respect of the Reference Offers and to resolve
disputes in relation to Arqiva’s obligations under the Undertakings. To date, no disputes have been
referred to the OTA-BTS for resolution under his dispute resolution powers.

**_Ofcom—Significant Market Power_**

The Communications Act (discussed further below) was part of a regulatory framework that implemented
a package of five European directives. This regulatory framework aimed to respond specifically to
competition issues in the rapidly developing industry, including harmonising regulation across Europe and
reducing entry barriers and fostering prospects for effective competition for the benefit of consumers.
Section 45 of the Communications Act enables Ofcom to impose regulatory conditions on undertakings
that it has determined have ‘‘significant market power’’.

Ofcom imposed a number of regulatory conditions on Arqiva (then Crown Castle UK Limited and
National Transcommunications Limited) under Section 45 of the Communications Act on 28 April 2005,
following a review of the broadcasting transmission services market. These were revoked on 10 November
2016, on the basis that the Undertakings, described above, had effectively incorporated the content of the
2005 regulatory conditions. Ofcom stated that it retains the ability to open a fresh review into the market
should there be any significant changes in the market, ‘‘in particular the removal or significant alteration’’
of the Undertakings.

The regulatory conditions related to the provision of access to the mast and site network and shared or
shareable antenna systems acquired, constructed or installed by Arqiva for the purpose of providing

169


-----

analogue and/or digital terrestrial broadcasting transmission services in the United Kingdom. Further
details are set out in Ofcom’s Final Statement ‘‘Broadcasting Transmission Services: a review of the
market’’ dated 10 November 2016.

**Communications Act**

The Communications Act is the relevant regulatory regime governing communications in the UK,
supervised and enforced by Ofcom.

**_Ofcom_**

The UK’s independent communications regulator is Ofcom, which was established by the Office of
Communications Act 2002, replacing a number of existing authorities (the Office of Telecommunications,
the Radio Authority, the Radio Communications Agency, the Broadcasting Standards Commission and the
Independent Television Commission). Ofcom’s main decision-making body is its board, which provides its
strategic direction.

Under the Communications Act, Ofcom’s two primary duties are:

- to further the interests of citizens in relation to communication matters; and

- to further the interests of consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate, by promoting
competition.

Subject to these primary duties, the Communications Act also requires Ofcom to exercise and perform its
powers and duties to secure:

- the optimal use for wireless technology of the electro-magnetic spectrum;

- the availability throughout the UK of a wide range of electronic communications services;

- the availability throughout the UK of a wide range of television and radio services which (taken as a
whole) are both of high quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests;

- the maintenance of a sufficient plurality of providers of different television and radio services;

- the application, in the case of television and radio services, of standards that provide adequate
protection to members of the public from the inclusion of offensive and harmful material in such
services; and

- the application, in the case of all television and radio services, of standards that provide adequate
protection to members of the public and all other persons from both unfair treatment in programmes
included in such services and unwarranted infringements of privacy resulting from activities carried on
for the purposes of such services.

In carrying out its duties, Ofcom is obliged to have regard, in all cases, to the principles under which
regulatory activities should be transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted only at
cases in which action is needed.

Ofcom regulates the television and radio sectors, fixed line telecoms, mobile, postal services and the
airwaves over which wireless devices operate. In the context of Arqiva’s business units, this means that
Ofcom regulates significant aspects of the Terrestrial Broadcast business unit, including with respect to
NA, MTS and spectrum, and also regulates Arqiva’s use of spectrum in the UK in its Telecoms & M2M
and Satellite & Media business units. Ofcom is also the regulator for a number of Arqiva’s significant
customers, including MNO customers of Arqiva’s site sharing business, broadcasters and Multiplex
operators.

**_General Conditions_**

_Overview_

The Communications Act grants a general authorisation for providers of electronic communications
networks (ECNs) and electronic communications systems (ECSs), to operate without requiring an
individual licence provided they comply with the generally applicable conditions of providing an ECN or
ECS. Arqiva Limited and Arqiva Services Limited operate under this general authorisation regime.

170


-----

The general authorisation regime is subject to the general conditions of entitlement (the **General**
**Conditions). The General Conditions include requirements for providers to comply with certain technical**
standards relating to, for example, general access and interconnection obligations. The current
consolidated version of the General Conditions was published on 28 May 2015.

_Enforcement_

If Ofcom determines that there are reasonable grounds for believing that a provider is in contravention of
any of the General Conditions which apply to that provider, it may issue a notification. The provider must
comply with the notified conditions and remedy the consequences of the notified contraventions (usually
within one month). If the provider does not comply with the notification, Ofcom may issue an enforcement
notification in which Ofcom will specify the steps required to be taken by the provider.

Ofcom may bring civil proceedings for an injunction, specific performance or any other appropriate
remedy or impose a financial penalty if a provider is in contravention of an enforcement notification. Any
financial penalty is to be such amount as Ofcom considers appropriate and proportionate to the relevant
contravention, up to a maximum of 10% of the turnover generated by the notified provider’s relevant
business in the relevant period. For this purpose, the relevant business is how much of the provider’s
business relates to the provision of ECNs and ECSs (and related activities) and relevant period is the
preceding 12-month period ending on 31 March prior to the first notification being given.

To date, Arqiva has not been subject to any enforcement procedures in respect of the General Conditions.

_Revisions to the General Conditions_

The Communications Act conferred powers on Ofcom to set, modify or revoke the General Conditions at
any time provided that any condition or modification imposed: is objectively justifiable in relation to the
networks, services or facilities to which it relates; does not unduly discriminate against particular persons
or descriptions of persons; is proportionate to what the condition or modification is intended to achieve;
and, in relation to what it is intended to achieve, is transparent.

Ofcom launched a consultation on proposed changes to the General Conditions relating to consumer
protection on 20 December 2016, which it stated are intended to make the rules clearer and more
practical, remove any redundant rules, and make compliance simpler. On 19 September 2017, Ofcom
launched a wider review of the General Conditions. The consultation ended on 14 November 2017. In
March 2018, Ofcom published a statement setting out its decisions on matters it had consulted on in
September 2017. In July 2018, a further statement was published setting out Ofcom’s decision to make
drafting changes to a number of the revised General Conditions. The revised conditions will come into
force on 1 October 2018.

**_Code Powers_**

_Overview_

Under the Communications Act, Ofcom is permitted to grant powers (Code Powers) under the Electronic
Communications Code (EC Code) to communications providers for the purposes of running an ECN or a
system of conduits (including tunnels, subways, tubes or pipes) for use by ECN providers. Subject to
necessary planning requirements, Code Powers enable communications providers to install and maintain
communications apparatus on public land and to take rights over private land (either with the agreement
of the landowner or by applying to the County Court). Code Powers also allow operators to benefit from
certain exemptions under Town and Country Planning legislation. Ofcom has given directions to apply the
EC Code to Arqiva Limited, Arqiva Services Limited and Arqiva Communications Limited.

Code Powers have effect subject to the restrictions and conditions set out in the Electronic
Communications Code (Conditions and Restrictions) Regulations 2003 (the Code Regulations). The Code
Regulations include conditions relating to: the installation of lines and electronic communications
apparatus; conservation areas; listed buildings and monuments; national parks and other protected areas;
the maintenance and safety of equipment; and arrangements with electricity suppliers.

Those with the benefit of Code Powers must also ensure that sufficient funds are available (for example by
way of a bond, insurance policy or guarantee) to meet any liabilities, costs or expenses reasonably incurred
by any appropriate authority in making good any damage caused by the installation or removal of any
electronic communications apparatus (Funds for Liabilities or FFL). Such funds must be available to meet

171


-----

any such liabilities which may arise up until three years after the occurrence of a relevant event. A relevant
event occurs if the recipient of Code Powers: ceases to provide an ECN; is prohibited from providing the
ECN for the purposes of which the Code Powers were applied; or becomes insolvent. Those with the
benefit of Code Powers are required to provide an annual certificate which states (among other things)
that sufficient FFL have been put in place. Arqiva Limited has arranged for financial institutions to
execute performance bonds which are lodged with Ofcom in respect of their FFL.

A contravention of any of the conditions imposed by the Code Regulations may be enforced by Ofcom in
the same manner as a contravention of a General Condition, with any penalty imposed not to exceed
£10,000.

The Law Commission in its report to Parliament in February 2013 stated that the EC Code regulates the
legal relationships between landowners and certain network operators, and enables those operators to
acquire rights over land compulsorily in some cases. Rights under the EC Code can be far-reaching, and
they underpin the physical networks of apparatus which support the provision of electronic
communications throughout the United Kingdom.

_Telecoms Leases—Security of Tenure_

The EC Code includes a form of security of tenure for entities with the benefit of Code Powers
(Operators). The EC Code allows any person with an interest in the land on which telecoms apparatus is
installed (or an interest in adjacent land) (Relevant Land) to give notice to the Operator that they require
the alteration of the apparatus (which includes, moving, replacing or removing it) to enable a proposed
improvement of the land. The EC Code also provides that if a person is entitled to require the removal of
apparatus from land (e.g. because the term of a lease has ended) that they are not entitled to enforce
removal of the apparatus except by giving notice. However, in both cases, the Operator may serve a
counter notice in which case such alteration or removal cannot be enforced without a court order being
made. The court must have regard to a number of matters set out in the EC Code including the principle
that no person should unreasonably be denied access to an ECN or electronic communications services.

_Installation of Apparatus—Power to Dispense with Required Agreement_

If an Operator requires any person with an interest in Relevant Land to agree to the Operator keeping
electronic communication apparatus installed on that land, or to execute works on that land in connection
with installing, maintaining or repairing that apparatus then the Operator may serve a notice on that
person. If the required agreement has not been given within 28 days of the notice being served then, under
the EC Code, the Operator may apply for a court order. If the court is satisfied that any prejudice caused
can either be adequately compensated for by money or is outweighed by the benefit accruing to those
persons whose access to an ECN or ECS will be secured, then it may make an order conferring the right(s)
requested by the operator (and so dispensing with the need for the person to consent).

_Review of Electronic Communications Code_

The previous EC Code was replaced by regulations under the Digital Economy Act 2017, following
extensive industry consultation. The new EC Code came into force on 28 December 2017. However, the
revisions to the EC Code do not apply retrospectively to existing agreements, save that the new renewal
procedures will apply on expiry.

In its publication A New Electronic Communications Code (May 2016) DCMS made (amongst others) the
following statements:

‘‘The overall package of reforms being put forward strikes the right balance of interests between site
providers, communications providers and, most importantly, the public interest in ensuring
communications services meet the needs of UK citizens in the digital era. The whole of the UK will benefit
from the long-term reforms put in place by the new Code as investment in digital communications
infrastructure is made easier, leading to a more sustainable, robust and technologically advanced physical
network.’’

‘‘The new Code rights will only apply to contracts signed after the law has come into effect, and will not
apply to existing contracts retrospectively. Government intends to make transitional arrangements that will
make clear how and when existing agreements transition to the provisions of the new Code. This will
enable a steady move to the new legal framework over the next 10 to 15 years as existing contracts come up
for renewal’’.

172


-----

Amongst other things, the new Code applies to access to land for the installation and operation of
electronic communications apparatus. The Government has stated that ‘‘physical apparatus is distinct from
land, and that the revised Code should therefore not be used to regulate access to infrastructure owned by
WIPs’’ (where WIPs refer to Wholesale Infrastructure Providers such as Arqiva). The legislation codifies
this position by making it clear through a new definition of ‘land’ that Code rights (which are rights granted
over land) do not include rights granted over electronic communications apparatus. There will be a period
of uncertainty in the market while the Act is subject to interpretation by the courts and it is possible that
the mobile network operators will lobby to allow them to share with each other on infrastructure for free
and regulate the price of access. As a substantial piece of legislation dealing with complex issues in a
changing environment, the Act is likely to be subject to amendment over time and there is a risk that the
principles that underpin the current legislation such as the current distinction of ‘‘physical apparatus’’ from
‘‘land’’ could be lost or modified.

**Spectrum Regulation**

**_International Spectrum Regulation_**

Radio spectrum (a term which is generally understood to mean the electromagnetic frequency range from
3 kHz to 300 GHz) is the means by which all wireless devices communicate. Spectrum is a finite resource,
demand for which greatly exceeds supply in many frequency bands and many geographical areas. The
frequencies below 1 GHz combine both capacity (bandwidth) and coverage (propagation), which makes
them suitable for a wide range of different applications, and so are considered to be the most valuable.

Radio spectrum propagation does not align with national borders. Therefore, international co-operation
has long been a feature of spectrum management policy.

At an international level, radio spectrum falls within the remit of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU), an agency of the United Nations, which co-ordinates the global exploitation of the radio
spectrum; promotes international co-operation in assigning satellite orbits; and establishes worldwide
standards to foster interconnection of communications systems. The ITU’s legal framework is based on its
constitution and convention (which has treaty status and to which the UK is a party) and the
Administration Regulations (comprising the Radio Regulations and the International Regulations). World
Radiocommunication Conferences are organised by the ITU to review and, where necessary, amend the
Radio Regulations (the international treaty governing, among other things, the use of radio-frequency
spectrum). These are held every three to four years. The most recent was in November 2015.

Within the EU, the European Commission oversees a number of measures designed to co-ordinate policy
approaches and work towards harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio
spectrum. The European Commission is assisted by the Radio Spectrum Committee (a committee
established under the Radio Spectrum Decision 676/2002/EC as part of the regulatory framework for
electronic communications which entered into force on 24 April 2002), which assists the European
Commission in the development and adoption of technical implementation measures aimed at ensuring
harmonised conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum, as well as the availability of
information related to the use of radio spectrum. See ‘‘—Radio Spectrum Policy Program’’ below for further
discussion of the European Commission’s spectrum policies.

The policies of the ITU and European Commission on management of radio spectrum and allocation of
frequencies drive the terms of the UK licensing regime that the business lines of Arqiva dependent on
spectrum operate under, including its Terrestrial Broadcast, Satellite & Media and M2M divisions.

**_Wireless Telegraphy Act Licences_**

_Licences_

Unless expressly licence-exempt, a licence under the WT Act is required in order to install or use wireless
telegraphy apparatus or to establish or use a wireless telegraphy station. Wireless telegraphy apparatus or a
wireless telegraphy station is apparatus or a station for the emitting or receiving (over paths that are not
provided by any material substance constructed or arranged for the purpose) of electromagnetic energy of
a frequency not exceeding 3,000 GHz that:

- can be used for conveying messages, sound or visual images, or for operating or controlling machines
or apparatus; or

173


-----

- is used in connection with determining the position, bearing or distance, or for gaining information as
to the presence, absence, position or motion of an object (or class of objects).

A wireless telegraphy licence is an authority granted by Ofcom authorising a named person to install or use
radio equipment in a clearly defined way. Such a licence may be granted either in relation to a particular
station or particular apparatus or in relation to any station(s) or apparatus falling within a description
specified in the licence. Any licences granted under the WT Act may be issued subject to such terms,
provisions and limitations as Ofcom thinks fit, including in particular, limitations as to the position and
nature of the station; the purposes for and the persons by whom the station may be used; and the
apparatus that may be installed there.

Arqiva holds WT Act licences in respect of its wireless distribution links, its television Multiplexes, its
national and local commercial radio Multiplexes, its satellite uplinks (both permanent earth stations and
transportable earth stations) and its 28 GHz (consisting of 27.8285-28.0525 GHz, paired with
28.8365-29.0605 GHz) and 412 MHz spectrum.

_Enforcement_

Ofcom may revoke a wireless telegraphy licence or vary its terms, provisions or limitations either by giving
notice to the licensee or by issuing a general notice applicable to all licences of that class. In February 2006,
Ofcom published a Wireless Telegraphy General Licence Conditions Booklet the terms of which are
incorporated into and form part of the terms of each wireless telegraphy licence to which the conditions
apply. Under the general licence conditions, Ofcom may not revoke a wireless telegraphy licence to which
the general conditions apply other than in certain specified circumstances, which include: (i) where the
licensee consents, (ii) if a condition has been breached, (iii) in the interests of national security, or (iv) for
reasons related to the management of the radio spectrum.

If Ofcom proposes to revoke or vary a wireless telegraphy licence it must notify the licensee stating the
reasons for its proposed revocation or variation and specifying the period the licensee has: to make
representations on the matter; and, if the proposal is as a result of a contravention of a term, to comply
with that term. Within one month of the end of such period, Ofcom must decide whether or not to revoke
or vary the licence in accordance with its proposal (or a modified version of its proposal) and notify the
licensee of its decision.

To date, Arqiva has not been subject to any enforcement procedures in respect of any of its WT Act
licences. However, the Group has received a notice of revocation in respect of the WT Licences for COM
7 and COM 8, as initially contemplated in the break clause.

_Spectrum Trading_

The WT Act allows Ofcom to make regulations authorising wireless telegraphy licence holders to transfer
rights and obligations under licences which have been designated as tradeable to a third party (known as
spectrum trading). Only certain types of spectrum licences have been designated as tradeable and
spectrum trading does not, for example, apply to the WT Act licences that Arqiva holds in respect of its
television and radio Multiplexes (unless selling the relevant Multiplex as well).

Spectrum trading was first introduced in the UK by the Wireless Telegraphy (Spectrum Trading)
Regulations 2004 (as amended) which allows for three different types of transfer:

- outright transfers—where all rights and obligations under a licence are transferred from one party to
another (so that the transferor no longer has any rights or obligations under the licence);

- concurrent transfers—where the rights and obligations under a licence are transferred on a concurrent
basis (so that the transferor and transferee both share the rights and obligations under the licence);
and

- partial transfers—where only some of the rights and obligations under a licence are transferred from
one party to another. Partial transfers can be outright or concurrent and the transfer can be on a
frequency, geographical or time basis.

The type of transfer a licensee can undertake will depend on which class the licence is in and whether that
class allows for all or only some types of trade.

174


-----

With spectrum trading, the transferee is granted its own WT Act licence. In 2011, spectrum leasing was
also introduced. With spectrum leasing, the lease holder is not granted its own licence (as is the case with
spectrum trading) but uses the licence holder’s spectrum by virtue of a lease contract with the licence
holder. Currently, spectrum leasing is limited to business radio area defined licences and most auction
licences.

In relation to Arqiva’s spectrum licences, the two spectrum licences that Arqiva acquired at auction
(national licences for the 412-414 MHz and 28 GHz frequencies) are tradeable.

Arqiva acquired additional spectrum licences in the 28 GHz band originally awarded to UK Broadband
Limited in 2016 through spectrum trading. The licences are each limited to use in a defined geographical
area, linked to the locations of Arqiva’s satellite earth stations. In July 2017, the Group acquired an
additional 28 GHz spectrum licence from an intelligent managed services provider, Luminet. This licence
for 224 MHz of spectrum covers Central and Greater London and bolsters the Group’s existing nationwide
28 GHz band ownership.

Arqiva and Airwave entered into a memorandum of understanding on 16 May 2008, under which Arqiva
granted Airwave an option to take a lease of radio spectrum between 412-414 MHz and 422-424 MHz,
which was licensed by Ofcom to Arqiva at the time. Arqiva exercised its right to call back 20 of the
80 channels in 2008 to use for electricity and gas smart metering. The Group repurchased a further
20 channels in December 2017 to provide increased capacity for the Group’s smart metering contracts with
the DCC and Thames Water.

**_Multiplex Licences_**

_Digital Terrestrial Television_

DTT is transmitted on television Multiplexes licensed by Ofcom. The following Multiplexes are currently
licensed for DTT in the UK: Multiplex 1 (PSB 1), Multiplex 2 (PSB 2), Multiplex A (COM 4), Multiplex B
(PSB 3), Multiplex C (COM 5), Multiplex D (COM 6), Multiplex E (COM 7 and 8), Multiplex L (local)
and Multiplex Northern Ireland. Multiplexes C, D and E (the latter of which permits two HD enabled
Multiplexes which are referred to as ‘‘COM 7’’ and ‘‘COM 8’’ and together as the Group’s DVB-T2
Multiplexes) are licensed to the Group and operated by Arqiva Services Limited.

Commercial DTT Multiplex licences consist of a licence to provide a multiplex service under the
Broadcasting Act and a separate licence under the WT Act to permit use of the allocated spectrum
frequencies associated with operating under the Broadcasting Act licence (see further ‘‘—Wireless
_Telegraphy Act Licences’’ above). The exceptions to this are that: (a) one Multiplex operated by the BBC_
(Multiplex 1) is granted by the government and therefore consists only of the WT Act licence concerning
the necessary spectrum, with no Broadcasting Act licence; and (b) Arqiva’s ‘‘Multiplex E’’ licence consists
only of a WT Act and does not require an associated Broadcasting Act licence (see further ‘‘—700 MHz
_Clearance Project and DVB-T2 Multiplex licences’’ below)._

Multiplex licences contain conditions for the provision of services over the Multiplex and the behaviour of
the licensee, such as: ensuring that the signals attain high standards in terms of technical quality and
reliability; ensuring that a certain percentage of digital capacity is used or available for use for the
broadcasting of particular types of programmes or services; the provision of information to Ofcom; and
complying with any guidance approved by Ofcom for the purpose of ensuring fair and effective
competition in the provision of licensed services. Ofcom may vary Multiplex licence conditions in any
respect provided that the licensee has been given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to
Ofcom concerning the proposed variation.

Multiplex licensees are also constrained by the prescribed technical conditions within which they are
required to operate. For example, the frequencies that licensees are required to operate under, the powers
that the licensees are required to operate at and the manner and form in which the services are to be
provided are all prescribed by Ofcom. As noted above (see ‘‘—International Spectrum Regulation’’),
Ofcom’s approach to spectrum management, including in relation to Multiplex licences, is informed and
influenced by the policies adopted by the European Commission and the ITU.

DTT Multiplex licences under the Broadcasting Act are issued for an initial term of 12 years, with an
option (if the licence was granted before 1 October 2002, as was the case with Multiplexes C and D) to
apply for one further 12-year renewal period (i.e. a maximum term of 24 years). The original term of the
Broadcasting Act licences awarded to Arqiva Services Limited to operate Multiplexes C and D was due to

175


-----

expire in November 2014. In accordance with the terms of the licences, Arqiva Services Limited applied to
renew both licences for a further period of 12 years. In January 2012, Ofcom issued a statement to confirm
its decision that both licences should be renewed (until November 2026) without the imposition of any
additional obligations or a requirement to pay any additional fees (other than the standard licence renewal
fee and subject to any future imposition of Administered Incentive Pricing (AIP)). See ‘‘—Future Pricing of
_Spectrum for Digital Terrestrial Broadcasting’’ below. Both the Broadcasting Act licences and the related WT_
Act licences for Multiplexes C and D have been renewed until November 2026.

In 2014, Ofcom stated that it ‘‘does not currently expect a full switch-off of DTT until post 2030’’.
Furthermore, a High Level Group on the future of the UHF band was commissioned by the European
Commission in 2013. Its Chairman, Pascal Lamy, presented his report in 2014, which highlighted the need
for ‘‘safeguards for access to spectrum below 700 MHz until 2030’’ to provide reassurance ‘‘to terrestrial
broadcasting for a next cycle of investments’’.

_700 MHz Clearance Project and DVB-T2 Multiplex licences_

Following a November 2015 decision at the World Radiocommunication Conference, Ofcom decided to
clear the 700 MHz band of broadcasting by 2022. Ofcom confirmed an accelerated clearance date of May
2020 in October 2016 with the intention to auction the cleared frequencies for mobile data usage. This is
intended to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile services, which is expected to continue for the
next decade, and to harmonise international band plans. In order to create this additional space for mobile
broadband, some of the DTT platform services are being moved from the 700 MHz band (694-790 MHz)
into the 600 MHz band (550-606 MHz, and which had been cleared as a consequence of the digital
switchover, which was completed in October 2012 in the UK resulting in the switch off of all analogue TV
services).

On 29 July 2013, Ofcom issued the Group a single licence for the use of the 600 MHz band for establishing
DTT Multiplexes using DVB-T2/MPEG-4 technology (the **DVB-T2 Multiplex licences). The DVB-T2**
Multiplex licences were granted for the purpose of providing a DTT multiplex service (which is also
capable of providing additional services including HD content). The DVB-T2 Multiplex licences are
granted under the WT Act alone (with no associated licence under the Broadcasting Act). They expire
nominally on the 31 December 2026 subject to early revocation by Ofcom, which can be made on
24-months’ notice. As part of 700 MHz clearance these multiplexes will be moved to the ‘‘centre gap’’
spectrum in the 700 MHz band. Ofcom stated in October 2016 that it would permit the DVB-T2
Multiplexes to continue operating until at least 1 May 2020. Ofcom recently served notice on the DVB-T2
licences, and accordingly the licences will end in June 2020. However, Ofcom may permit services to
continue after that date, through a new licence arrangement, if there is not demand from MNOs for use of
the spectrum. The Group is discussing the terms of this extended access with Ofcom.

In 2016, Ofcom decided to accelerate the 700 MHz clearance programme by 18 months and aims to release
the 700 MHz band in the second quarter of 2020. The 700 MHz clearance programme is underway with
changes occurring at different times in each area of the UK, starting with parts of Scotland in 2017. See
‘‘—Digital Terrestrial Television’’ above.

_Commercial Radio Multiplex Licences_

As of 30 June 2018, there were 59 commercial digital radio Multiplex licences in the UK; two national
commercial digital radio Multiplex licences (one owned by Digital One Limited and the other by Sound
Digital Limited, both being members of the Arqiva group) and 57 local commercial digital Multiplex
licences (of which 25 were owned by various members of the Arqiva group, including through JVs). These
are in addition to the one national digital radio Multiplex licence owned and used by the BBC.
Commercial radio Multiplex licences consist of a licence to provide a multiplex service under the
Broadcasting Act and a separate licence under the WT Act to permit use of the allocated spectrum
frequencies associated with operating under the Broadcasting Act licence (see further ‘‘—Wireless
_Telegraphy Act Licences’’ above)._

The original national commercial radio Multiplex licence awarded to Digital One Limited was due to
expire in November 2011. Ofcom agreed to renew the licence for a further 12 years, expiring in November
2023. The only requirement imposed by Ofcom in connection with the licence renewal was to require
Digital One Limited to submit a new technical plan which shows how its current levels of coverage are
provided and will continue to be provided throughout the period of the renewed licence.

176


-----

The second national commercial radio Multiplex licence is held by Sound Digital Limited, a joint venture
company 40% owned by Arqiva Limited, with Bauer Radio Limited and Wireless Group Media (GB)
Limited (formerly UTV Media (GB) Limited) owning 30% each. See ‘‘Business—Business Units—
_Terrestrial Broadcast Business Unit—Terrestrial Broadcast—Radio—Managed transmission services’’). The_
licence was granted on 24 February 2016 and is due to expire on 29 February 2028.

Under the Broadcasting Act, Radio Multiplex licences are generally granted for an initial period of twelve
years. All of the 25 commercial local radio licences held by an Arqiva group member are due to expire
between 2022 and July 2026. Commercial radio Multiplex licences may be renewed once for a subsequent
period of either eight or 12 years (the period for renewal for any given licence depends on the date the
licence was originally granted). Commercial local radio Multiplex licences can be renewed more than once
if the licence holder has completed works to ensure coverage meets that in Ofcom’s coverage plan, but
licences renewed under this condition will expire on 31 December 2030.

As with DTT Multiplex licences, national and local commercial radio Multiplex licences contain conditions
for the provision of services over the Multiplex and the behaviour of the licensee, such as: ensuring that the
signals attain high standards in terms of technical quality and reliability; ensuring that the amount of digital
capacity reserved by Ofcom for any other holders of national Multiplex licences (on the frequencies
specified by Ofcom) is available for the broadcasting of a simulcast radio service; that at least 80% (or such
other percentage as the Secretary of State may specify) of digital capacity on the frequencies specified by
Ofcom is used or available for use for the broadcasting of digital sound programme services, simulcast
radio services, programme-related services and relevant technical services; the provision of information to
Ofcom; complying with any guidance approved by Ofcom for the purpose of ensuring fair and effective
competition in the provision of licensed services; and complying with any direction given by Ofcom which
(in the opinion of Ofcom) is appropriate having regard to Ofcom and the licensee’s duties imposed by the
Broadcasting Act, the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the Communications Act.

Ofcom may vary commercial radio Multiplex licence conditions in any respect provided that the licensee
has been given a reasonable opportunity to make representations to Ofcom concerning the proposed
variation.

Commercial radio Multiplex licences (national and local) (and the associated WT Act licences see
‘‘—Wireless Telegraphy Act Licences’’ above) also require adherence to the Digital Technical Code (the DT
**Code), which incorporates technical requirements common to all such licences. The current version of the**
DT Code (published on 1 July 2014) includes requirements on radiated signals, technical management of
Multiplexes and relationship of data services to bearer conduits.

_Digital Radio Switchover_

The Digital Economy Act 2010 gives the Secretary of State the power to nominate a date for the switch
from analogue to digital radio broadcasting and sets out changes to the licensing regime to take into
account radio digital switchover. The Digital Radio Action Plan launched in 2010 was finalised in
November 2013 and the DCMS announced it was not yet time to commit to the switchover. The
government stated that it would undertake a review which would consider setting a date for the digital
radio switchover when the following two criteria were met: when 50% of all radio listening is via digital
platforms; and when national DAB coverage is comparable to FM and local DAB reaches 90% of the
population and all major roads. These conditions have recently been met and, as of June 2018, the Group
is awaiting to hear from Government on its plans for an industry review and consultations. See ‘‘Industry—
_The UK Radio Industry—Digital Radio Switchover’’._

_Enforcement_

If Ofcom is satisfied that a television or commercial radio Multiplex licensee has failed to comply with a
condition of the licence or a related Ofcom direction, Ofcom can require the licensee to pay a financial
penalty or reduce the licence period by up to two years. The amount of any financial penalty imposed:

- in respect of a television or national radio commercial Multiplex licensee, is not to exceed the greater
of £250,000 (or such other sum as the Secretary of State may specify) and 5% of the aggregate amount
of the share of Multiplex revenue attributable to the licensee (as defined in the Broadcasting Act) for
its last complete accounting period falling within a period for which the licence has been in force; and

- in respect of a local radio commercial Multiplex licensee, is not to exceed £250,000.

177


-----

If the licensee’s failure is such that (if not remedied) it would justify the revocation of the licence, Ofcom
may specify the steps to be taken to remedy the failure, within a specified time period. If the licensee fails
to take such steps, Ofcom may revoke the licence if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the public interest to
do so.

There are certain other circumstances provided for in the Broadcasting Act and the Broadcasting Act 1990
under which Ofcom could revoke a television or commercial national radio or local radio Multiplex
licence, including (i) if there is a change in the nature or characteristics of the licensee or any change of
control of the licensee which is such that Ofcom would not have granted the licence in the new
circumstances; (ii) if Ofcom is satisfied that the licensee ceases to be a fit and proper person to hold the
licence; (iii) if the licensee fails to comply with a requirement to hold a related licence under the WT Act;
or (iv) if Ofcom is required to revoke the frequencies on which the Multiplex service is provided.

To date, Arqiva has not been subject to any enforcement procedures in respect of any of its television or
radio Multiplex licences.

_Future Pricing of Spectrum for Terrestrial Broadcasting_

Up to 2014, terrestrial broadcasters only paid administrative cost-based fees for their use of spectrum.
Some commercial broadcasters also paid certain fees under the Broadcasting Act that include an implicit
charge for use of spectrum. In 2013, Ofcom announced a potential framework for introducing spectrum
rental fees under an AIP scheme to encourage efficient spectrum use (i.e. based on the opportunity cost of
the spectrum used). Ofcom has stated that it does not envisage applying AIP-based fees until 2020. In the
interim period from late 2014 to 2020, Ofcom has charged and is expected to continue to charge
administrative cost-based fees to Multiplex operators, like the Group, based on Ofcom’s direct costs
associated with managing spectrum and the administration of broadcast licences. Since late 2014, Ofcom
has charged operators £188,000 per national DTT Multiplex per year in such fees.

**Site Regulation**

**_Landlord and Tenant Act_**

While the recently-enacted new EC Code ended the duplication of control that has existed over several
decades by providing that new Code leases will not benefit from security of tenure provisions in the
Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (1954 Act) (see ‘‘—Communications Act—Code Powers—Review of
_Electronic Communications Code’’), the 1954 Act continues to apply on expiry of protected leases until a_
new lease is entered into (or the lease is terminated under the 1954 Act). When the new lease is
completed, it will be governed by the new EC Code and the 1954 Act will no longer apply. The 1954 Act
affords a tenant under a qualifying business an automatic right to renew its lease unless the landlord
successfully opposes the grant of a new lease on one of the grounds contained in section 30(1) of the 1954
Act (such as the landlord intends to occupy the premises himself or to demolish, reconstruct or carry out a
substantial redevelopment of the premises). However, the 1954 Act does not apply to genuine licences
(rather than agreements which are labelled licences but are in fact leases—the key difference being that a
licensee does not have exclusive possession of the premises) and it is possible to contract out of the 1954
Act. This is in contrast to the EC Code which applies to both leases and licences and cannot be contracted
out of.

**_Town and Country Planning Legislation_**

Different planning systems operate across the four main UK regions (England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland), although the key elements are similar. All systems require planning permission for
operational development and material changes of use. Such permissions can be granted either on
application to the local planning authority (with appeal procedures if refused) or by the relevant General
Permitted Development Order (GPDO) in each region. GPDOs grant permitted development rights to EC
Code operators, like Arqiva, and vary across the UK. Such rights are subject to limitations and conditions.
For example, in England most new masts up to a height of 25 meters are permitted in undesignated areas
or 20 meters in designated areas (e.g. highways, national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty and
conservation areas) but are still subject to local authority approval on detailed siting and appearance,
which can be refused. In Wales, a new mast of up to 15 meters benefits from permitted development rights
subject to prior approval.

178


-----

In Scotland, changes to permitted development rights for EC Code operators came into effect on 31 July
2017 in which new ground based masts up to 25 meters in height and which are outside designated areas
will be subject to permitted development rights subject to a form of prior approval. Northern Ireland
carried out a consultation on permitted development rights for EC Code Operators in 2016 where
permitted development rights exist in respect of existing masts. Where planning applications are required,
they must be determined against relevant national and local policy. These universally encourage mast or
site sharing as the first option to explore, in reference to deploying new radio masts. For example in
England, the National Planning Policy Framework provides that in preparing local plans, local planning
authorities should:

- support the expansion of Electronic Communications Networks (ECN), including telecommunications
and high speed broadband;

- aim to keep the numbers of radio and telecommunications masts and the sites for such installations to
a minimum consistent with the efficient operation of the network; and

- existing masts, buildings and other structures should be used, unless the need for a new site has been
justified.

This policy requirement echoes a statutory requirement placed on EC Code operators, who include the
MNOs. Regulation 3(4) under the EC Code requires a code operator to share the use of electronic
communications apparatus, where practicable.

**Radio Spectrum Policy Program**

On 15 February 2012, the European Parliament adopted the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme (RSPP)
which sets out the EU principles to ensure efficient management and use of spectrum and to promote
investment, competition and innovation. Recital 10 of the RSPP notes that the programme should specify
guiding principles and objectives up to 2015. In February 2016, the Radio Spectrum Policy Group (RSPG),
a high-level advisory group that assists the European Commission in the development of radio spectrum
policy, noted that the objectives of the first RSPP have been largely fulfilled; in particular the
implementation of harmonisation measures to support the internal market and the identification of at least
1200 MHz of suitable spectrum for wireless data traffic. The RSPG also called on the European
Commission to review and revise the RSPP to set new objectives and targeted actions for the coming years.
No such review has yet taken place.

The RSPG is actively contributing to the development of Europe’s spectrum policy strategy regarding 5G.
In June 2017 the RSPG Working Group on spectrum related aspects of 5G published a progress report
setting out the RSPG’s plans to develop a strategic roadmap towards 5G for Europe, which will focus on
the services to be offered and the goals to be achieved by the deployment of 5G systems. This work is
closely linked to the RSPG’s separate strategic review on spectrum aspects of the IoT, which addresses the
impact of 5G on the sector.

The RSPG developed a strategic roadmap towards 5G for Europe and adopted a second opinion on 5G in
February 2018 (supplementary opinion on strategic issues related to spectrum regulation of 5G networks).
In June 2018 the RSPG Working Group on 5G published a progress report, in which they stated that
‘‘RSPG will continue its efforts and contribute actively to the development of Europe’s spectrum policy
strategy regarding 5G, including bands being studied at WRC, and other spectrum needed to deliver the
services to all European citizens including for IoT/M2M and other applications such as ITS.’’ The progress
report also noted that RSPG intended to issue a draft report and opinion in November 2018 with a final
report and opinion in April 2019.

Martin Healey, Christian Seymour and Mark Braithwaite, which has the responsibilities of handling
risk management procedures and internal controls, compliance (including whistle blowing
arrangements) and regulatory issues, accuracy of group financial statements, the appointment and
remuneration of external auditors, and internal audit department reports to the Audit & Risk
Committee;

(b) the Nominations Committee, comprised of Mike Parton (chair), Neil King, Christian Seymour and
Mark Braithwaite, which has the responsibilities of overseeing the size, structure and composition
(including skills, experience, independence, knowledge and diversity) of the Board of Directors to
ensure that the continued leadership ability is sufficient to allow the business to compete effectively in
the market;

(c) the Remuneration Committee, comprised of Sally Davis (Chair), Mike Parton, Paul Donovan, Neil
King, Christian Seymour and Mark Braithwaite, which has the responsibilities of assisting the Board in
deciding and approving remuneration of key Group personnel, and reviewing matters involving all
Group personnel; and

(d) the Operational Resilience Committee, comprised of Paul Donovan (chair), Frank Dangeard, Martin
Healey, Christian Seymour and Nathan Luckey, which has the responsibilities of overseeing the
effectiveness of the operational resilience strategies and procedures of the Group (including
principles, policies and practices adopted in complying with all statutory, and sub-statutory, standards
and regulatory requirements in respect of safety, health and environment matters affecting the
activities of the Group).

**Risk Management**

The Group has a strong corporate governance framework in place and also pays considerable attention to
the management of risk. This includes but is not limited to:

- an established enterprise risk management policy and framework in place across the whole Group;

- risk registers which are actively maintained and managed by each business, used to capture and assess
the risks faced and summarise the mitigating controls currently in place as well as describe additional

184


-----

controls that will be implemented to further reduce the risk exposure, and which are maintained in
line with the monthly business reviews;

- a corporate level risk register, which is formally reviewed every three to four months with the CEO
and the Management Board;

- a risk management update, which is presented at the Audit & Risk Committee meetings scheduled
across the year; and

- an internal audit function which delivers an audit plan which is approved by the Audit & Risk
Committee.

The Group has consistently demonstrated the effectiveness of its risk management approach and believes
it has ensured the necessary controls and actions are in place to mitigate those risks, in particular those
relating to recent GDPR legislation, IT security activity and the 700 MHz clearance programme.

**SUMMARY OF THE TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS**

_The following is a summary of certain terms of the principal Transaction Documents and is qualified in its_
_entirety by reference to the detailed provisions of the Transaction Documents._

**Transaction Documents means the Notes, the Note Trust Deed, the Agency Agreement, the Master**
Definitions Agreement, the Security Agreement, the Liquidity Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in ‘‘Terms and Conditions’’) and the
Intercompany Loan Agreement.

**Note Trust Deed**

Unless defined above, all capitalised terms in this section titled ‘‘Summary of the Transaction Documents—
_Note Trust Deed’’ shall have the meaning given to them in Condition 4 (Covenants)._

**_General_**

The Issuer, the Guarantors and the Note Trustee will enter into a trust deed (the **Note Trust Deed)**
pursuant to which the Notes will be constituted. The Note Trust Deed will include the form of the Notes.

The Note Trust Deed contains, amongst other things, the following provisions:

(a) the Issuer’s covenant to the Note Trustee (who holds the benefit of the covenant on trust for the
Noteholders) to pay the principal and interest on the Notes in accordance with the Conditions;

(b) the Issuer is at liberty from time to time (but subject always to the provisions of the Note Trust Deed)
without the consent of the Noteholders to create and issue further notes having the same terms and
conditions to the Notes so as to form part of the same class;

(c) requirements in relation to Global Notes and Definitive Notes;

(d) the Guarantees given by the Guarantors as further described below;

(e) the Note Trustee’s power to authorise or waive any breach or proposed breach of any of the covenants
or provisions of the Note Trust Deed, the Conditions or the other Transaction Documents or
determine that any Event of Default shall not be treated as such for the purposes of the Note Trust
Deed, provided that the Note Trustee shall not exercise such powers conferred upon it by such
provision in contravention of the Intercreditor Agreement, any express direction by an Extraordinary
Resolution (as defined in the Note Trust Deed) or of a request pursuant to _Condition 13.2_
_(Modification and waiver);_

(f) provisions relating to meetings of Noteholders; and

(g) the appointment, retirement, removal, remuneration, indemnification and liability of the Note
Trustee.

**_Guarantees_**

The Guarantors each unconditionally and irrevocably guarantee that if the Issuer does not pay any sum
payable by it under the Note Trust Deed or the Notes at the time and on the date specified for such
payment (whether on the normal due date, on acceleration or otherwise) the Guarantors will pay or
procure the payment of that sum to or to the order of the Note Trustee, according to the terms of the Note
Trust Deed and the Notes (as applicable).

The Guarantors each unconditionally and irrevocably agree, as an independent primary obligation, that
they will pay to the Note Trustee sums sufficient to indemnify the Note Trustee and each Noteholder
against any loss suffered by it as a result of any sum expressed to be payable by the Issuer under the Note
Trust Deed or the Notes not being paid on the due date or any other payment obligation of the Issuer
under the Note Trust Deed or the Notes being or becoming void, voidable or unenforceable for any reason.

Each of the Guarantor’s guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall remain in full force and effect until
all amounts due in respect of the Notes or under the Note Trust Deed have been paid in full. Each of the
Guarantors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Note Trustee and the Noteholders against the Issuer in
respect of any amounts paid by it pursuant to the Guarantee.

The Guarantors have, pursuant to the Security Agreement, secured their obligations under the
Guarantees. Enforcement of the security created pursuant to the Security Agreement is subject to the

187


-----

Intercreditor Agreement. The payment obligations of the Guarantors in respect of the Guarantee
constitute direct, secured, irrevocable and unconditional obligations of the Guarantors.

**_Covenants of the Obligors_**

In addition to the restrictive, information and general covenants set out in the Conditions of the Notes, so

(f) **Opinions: to give or to procure to be given to the Note Trustee such opinions, certificates, information**

Deed, the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party or by operation of law;

(g) Ratings: other than in respect of any commercially sensitive information in respect of the business of
the Parent Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, to furnish, or procure that there is furnished, from time to
time, any and all documents, instruments, information and undertakings that may be requested by the
Rating Agencies in order to maintain the current ratings of the Notes (save that when any such
document, instrument, information and/or undertaking is not within the possession or control of the
Issuer, the Issuer agrees to use all reasonable efforts to furnish, or procure that there is furnished,
from time to time any such documents, instruments, information and undertakings);

(h) Listing: to use all reasonable endeavours to maintain (or, in the case of the Guarantors, procure the
Issuer maintains) the listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for
trading on the Euro MTF Market for as long as the Notes are outstanding (or, if such listing or
trading ceases to be possible, or becomes duly onerous, then the Issuer will use its reasonable
endeavours to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on such other exchange (which shall be a
‘‘regulated market’’ for the purposes of Article 1(13) of Directive 93/22/EEC and a ‘‘recognised stock
exchange’’ (as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for the purposes of section 882 of
the Income Tax Act 2007));

(i) **Centre of main interests: not to deliberately cause or allow its registered office or centre of main**
interests to be in or maintain an establishment (as that term is used in the European Insolvency
Regulation (EU) 2015/848) in any jurisdiction other than England;

(j) **Further assurance: so far as is permitted by applicable law, to at all times execute all such further**
documents and do all such acts and things as may be necessary at any time or times in the reasonable
opinion of the Note Trustee to give effect to the Note Trust Deed and other Transaction Documents;
and

(k) Set-off: to pay moneys payable by it to the Note Trustee without set-off, counterclaim, deduction or

188


-----

the full amount which would otherwise have been payable by it to the Note Trustee under the Note
Trust Deed.

**_Governing Law_**

The Note Trust Deed (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it) will be
governed by English law.

**Intercompany Loan Agreement**

The Issuer and AF No 2 will enter into an intercompany loan agreement under which all proceeds of
issuance of the Notes will be on-lent by the Issuer (in such capacity, the Intercompany Lender) to AF No 2
(in such capacity, the Intercompany Borrower) (the Intercompany Loan Agreement and the loans by the
Intercompany Lender to the Intercompany Borrower thereunder, the Intercompany Loans).

The Intercompany Loans will correspond to the principal amount of the Notes such that the economic
terms of the Intercompany Loans match the economic terms of the corresponding Notes.

**_Intercompany Loans_**

Subject to the Issuer Profit Amount, each Intercompany Loan is structured and tranched to match the
tenor, interest rate and payment dates of the corresponding Notes. In addition to the interest payable on
each interest payment date, the Intercompany Borrower will pay to the Issuer (in its capacity as the
Intercompany Lender) an amount to cover the Issuer’s profit (the Issuer Profit Amount).

The Intercompany Loans to be made by the Issuer under the Intercompany Loan Agreement will be in
amounts and at rates of interest corresponding to amounts and rates applicable to the Notes and will have
interest periods which match the Interest Periods for such Notes. Interest on each Intercompany Loan
made under the Intercompany Loan Agreement will accrue from the date of such Intercompany Loan. In
addition, each Intercompany Loan will be repayable on the corresponding repayment date(s) in respect of
the Notes.

**_Redemption for tax reasons, illegality or other reasons_**

If:

(a) the Intercompany Borrower would on the next Interest Payment Date be required to pay additional
amounts due to withholding tax applying in respect of payments to be made under the Intercompany
Loan Agreement in respect of any Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes; or

(b) by reason of a change in law, it has become or will become unlawful for the Issuer (in its capacity as
Intercompany Lender) to make, fund or allow to remain outstanding all or any of the Intercompany
Loans corresponding to the Notes made or to be made by it under the Intercompany Loan
Agreement,

then the Issuer may, whilst such circumstance continues, give AF No 2 (in its capacity as Intercompany
Borrower) not more than 15 days’ nor fewer than 10 days’ prior notice (which notice shall be irrevocable)
of the requirement on AF No 2 (in its capacity as Intercompany Borrower) to prepay the whole (and not
part) of such Intercompany Loans which are or will be subject to such withholding or have become or will
become unlawful.

**_Fees_**

In consideration for the Issuer agreeing to make the Intercompany Loans available under the
Intercompany Loan Agreement, the Intercompany Borrower will agree to pay to the Issuer (as
Intercompany Lender) the fees set out in the Intercompany Loan Agreement.

Prior to the Issue Date, the Intercompany Borrower shall pay on behalf of the Issuer by way of the initial
fee (the Initial Facility Fee) any costs, losses or expenses of the Issuer reasonably incurred in connection
with the issue of Notes (including, inter alia, the fees and expenses of the Note Trustee, the Security Trustee
and the Issuer’s legal advisers, accountants and auditors).

After the Issue Date, the Intercompany Borrower will pay periodically an ongoing facility fee (the Ongoing
**Facility Fee) which shall meet the costs, losses and expenses of the Issuer in respect of amounts owed to, inter**
_alios, the Note Trustee, the Security Trustee (and any receiver appointed by the Security Trustee), the_

189


-----

Principal Paying Agent, the Paying Agents, the Agent Bank, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the
Issuer’s legal advisers, accountants and auditors (in each case, to the extent not covered by the Initial
Facility Fee). Any accrued but unpaid Ongoing Facility Fee will be paid at the same time as the repayment
of any Intercompany Loan.

**_Event of Default_**

The Issuer’s obligations to repay principal and pay interest on the Notes are intended to be met primarily
from the payments of principal and interest received from AF No 2 (in its capacity as the Intercompany
Borrower) under the Intercompany Loan Agreement. Failure of the Intercompany Borrower to repay an
Intercompany Loan will be a default under the Intercompany Loan Agreement, although it will not, of
itself, constitute an Event of Default.

**_Governing Law_**

The Intercompany Loan Agreement (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with it) will be governed by English law.

**_Agency Agreement_**

The Agency Agreement will be entered into between the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Principal Paying
Agent, the Agent Bank, the Registrar, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Note Trustee (the
**Agency Agreement). The Agency Agreement includes, amongst other things the following provisions:**

(a) the duties of the Principal Paying Agent and the terms on which they are appointed, or on which such
appointment may be resigned or terminated or any successor Principal Paying Agent may be
appointed;

(b) the duties of each Paying Agent and the terms on which they are appointed, or on which such
appointment may be resigned or terminated or any additional or successor Paying Agent may be
appointed;

(c) the duties of the Transfer Agent and the terms on which it is appointed, or on which such appointment
may be resigned or terminated or any additional or any successor Transfer Agent may be appointed;

(d) the duties of the Registrar and the terms on which it is appointed, or on which such appointment may
be resigned or terminated or any successor Registrar may be appointed;

(e) the duties of the Agent Bank and the terms on which it is appointed, or on which such appointment
may be resigned or terminated or any additional or any successor Agent Bank may be appointed;

(f) indemnity by the Issuer (failing whom, the Guarantors) of each of the agents against any liabilities
which it may properly incur or which may be made against it as a result of or in connection with its
appointment or the exercise of its powers and duties under the Agency Agreement, except for any
liabilities resulting from the Agent’s own wilful default, gross negligence or fraud;

(g) transfer to an account specified by the Principal Paying Agent of payments by the Issuer (failing
whom, the Guarantors) on each date on which any payment in respect of any Note becomes due
under the Conditions;

(h) to pay or cause to be paid by each Paying Agent payments of all amounts due in respect of the Notes
on behalf of the Issuer (and each Guarantor) in the manner provided in the Conditions;

(i) provisions under which the Principal Paying Agent shall notify each of the other Paying Agents, the
Registrar and the Note Trustee immediately: (a) if it has not by the relevant date received
unconditionally the full amount in the relevant currency required for a payment in respect of the
Notes; and (b) if it receives unconditionally the full amount of any sum payable in respect of the Notes
after that date;

(j) provisions relating to completing, authenticating and delivering Global Notes (as applicable) and (if
required) authenticating and delivering Definitive Notes;

(k) provisions relating to the exchange of a Global Note for a Definitive Note;

(l) the keeping of records of the payment, redemption, replacement, cancellation and destruction of
Notes; and

190


-----

(m) the fees and expenses of the agents.

**_Governing law_**

The Agency Agreement (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it) will be
governed by English law.

**Security Agreement**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into a security agreement (the **Security Agreement) with the**
Security Trustee in which:

(a) the Issuer will grant (a) first equitable security over (i) all amounts standing to the credit of each of
the Issuer’s bank accounts (the **Issuer Security Accounts) and debts represented thereby; (ii) each**
Authorised Investment made by the Issuer; (iii) all shares of any person owned by the Issuer including
dividends, interest and other distributions payable in respect thereof and all other rights related
thereto; (iv) any loan made by the Issuer to another member of the Group; and (v) all present and
future book or other debt owned by the Issuer; and (b) a first floating charge of the whole of the
undertaking, property, assets and rights (present and future) of the Issuer; and

(b) each Guarantor will grant (a) first equitable security over (i) all amounts standing to the credit of each
of that Guarantor’s bank accounts (the **Guarantors Security Accounts and together with the Issuer**
Security Accounts, the **Security Accounts) and debts represented thereby; (ii) each Authorised**
Investment made by that Guarantor; (iii) all shares of any person owned by that Guarantor including
dividends, interest and other distributions payable in respect thereof and all other rights related
thereto; and (iv) any loan made by that Guarantor to any member of the Group and (b) a first floating
charge over all the assets of that Guarantor.

**_Governing Law_**

The Security Agreement (and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it) will
be governed by English law.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors under the financing arrangements, an Intercreditor
agreement will be entered into by, amongst others, Arqiva Financing No. 3 PLC (AF3), the Issuer, the
Guarantors, HSBC Bank plc as the Liquidity Facility Agent and Deutsche Trustee Company Limited as the
Security Trustee and the Note Trustee (the Intercreditor Agreement).

The Intercreditor Agreement governs the relationships and relative priorities among:

(a) prior to the date on which the liabilities under the Liquidity Facility Agreement are fully discharged
(the Liquidity Facility Lender Discharge Date), the lenders under the Liquidity Facility Agreement
and after the Liquidity Facility Lender Discharge Date, the lenders under any other and future credit
facility (each a Credit Facility) made available to a member of the Group where the relevant creditors
under such credit facility have acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement (the **Credit Facility Lenders**
and together with the creditor representatives in relation to such credit facility and each arranger
under such credit facility, the **Credit Facility Creditors) (the Liquidity Facility Agreement together**
with the documents evidencing such credit facilities, the Credit Facility Documents);

(b) parties that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as super senior hedge counterparties to certain
hedging agreements (the **Super Senior Hedging Agreements) (the** **Super Senior Hedge**
**Counterparties, and together with the Credit Facility Creditors, the Super Senior Creditors);**

(c) the holders of the Notes (together with the Note Trustee, the Senior Note Creditors) and the other
creditor representatives, arrangers, noteholders and lenders under and in relation to any other
documents evidencing any other and future pari passu debt liabilities (together with the Senior Note
Creditors, the Pari Passu Debt Creditors) (the Note Trust Deed, the Notes, the Transaction Security
documents, the Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement (together, the Senior Note Documents) and
all documents evidencing all such pari passu debt liabilities, together being the **Pari Passu Debt**
**Documents);**

191


-----

(d) parties that accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as pari passu hedge counterparties to certain
hedging agreements (the **Pari Passu Hedging Agreements, and together with the Super Senior**
Hedging Agreements, the Hedging Agreements) (the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties, and together
with the Pari Passu Debt Creditors, the **Pari Passu Creditors) (the Super Senior Hedge**
Counterparties and the Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties together being the Hedge Counterparties);

(e) certain intra-group creditors and debtors; and

(f) the Security Trustee.

In connection with the issuance of the Notes, the Note Trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes, the
Issuer and each other Obligor became parties to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Parent Guarantor and
the Obligors are referred to in this description as the original debtors, and together with any other member
of the Group which accedes to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Debtors.

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth, among other things:

- the relative ranking of certain indebtedness of, and security interests over certain assets and property
granted by, the Debtors (such security, the Transaction Security);

- when payments can be made in respect of certain indebtedness of the Debtors;

- the terms pursuant to which certain indebtedness will be subordinated;

- when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that indebtedness;

- when Transaction Security and guarantees may be released to permit a sale or disposal of any assets
subject to Transaction Security;

- turnover provisions; and

- the order for applying proceeds from enforcement action and other amounts received by the Security
Trustee.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It
does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety. As such, you are urged to read the
Intercreditor Agreement because it, and not the description that follows, defines your rights as holders of
the Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, by accepting a Note, the relevant holder thereof shall be deemed to
have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

_Ranking and Priority of Liabilities_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the liabilities of the Debtors in respect of the Credit Facility
Documents (the **Credit Facility Liabilities), the Hedging Agreements (the** **Hedging Liabilities) and the**
Pari Passu Debt Documents (Pari Passu Debt Liabilities) rank in right and priority of payment pari passu
and without any preference between them.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that certain intra-group claims and investor debt consisting of
liabilities owed to certain shareholders of the Issuer are subordinated to the Credit Facility Liabilities, the
Hedging Liabilities and the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities.

_Ranking and Priority of Transaction Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security shall rank and secure the Credit
Facility Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities and the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) pari passu and without preference between them (but only to the extent that
such Transaction Security is expressed to secure such liabilities).

Under the Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Transaction Security are applied
as provided below under ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’.

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement permits, inter alia,

192


-----

(a) in respect of Credit Facility Liabilities, Debtors to make payments at any time in accordance with, and
subject to the provisions of, the Credit Facility Documents;

(b) in respect of the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, Debtors to make payments at any time in accordance
with, and subject to the provisions of, the Pari Passu Debt Documents;

(c) in respect of the Hedging Liabilities, Debtors to make payments then due to the Hedge Counterparty
under any Hedging Agreement:

(i) if the payment is a scheduled payment arising under the relevant Hedging Agreement;

(ii) to the extent the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of, among
others, the provisions in the Hedging Agreements relating to deduction or withholding for tax,
default interest and expenses;

(iii) to the extent the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises from a non-credit
related hedge close-out;

(iv) to the extent the relevant Debtor’s obligation to make a payment arises from a credit related
hedge close-out or a permitted automatic early termination event under the relevant Hedging
Agreement as a result of an event relating to the Debtor and no default is continuing at the time
of the payment or would result from the payment;

(v) to the extent that no default is continuing or would arise from the payment and the relevant
Debtor’s obligation to make the payment arises as a result of a close-out or termination arising as
a result of certain provisions in the Hedging Agreements relating to bankruptcy and the event of
default has occurred under the Hedging Agreement with respect to the relevant Hedge
Counterparty; and

(vi) if the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu Creditors give prior consent to
the payment being made.

(d) payments to lenders under any intra-group loan agreements (the Intra-Group Liabilities) from time
to time when due under the relevant intra-group loan agreement unless an acceleration event has
occurred, provided that the payments of Intra-Group Liabilities can continue to be made after an
acceleration event has occurred if the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors consent to such payment or if that payment is made to facilitate the making of permitted
payments of the Credit Facility Liabilities, the Hedging Liabilities or the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities;
and

(e) payments in respect of liabilities owed by any member of the Group to AF3 or any investor which is
subordinated in rights of payment to the Super Senior Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors (the
**Subordinated Liabilities) if such payment is not prohibited by the Liquidity Facility Agreement, any**
other credit facility agreement, any pari passu facility agreement, the Note Trust Deed or any other
pari passu note trust deed or if the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors each consent to such payment being made.

For the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement:

- the **Majority Super Senior Creditors means the Super Senior Creditors holding in aggregate more**
than 66.67% of commitments under the Credit Facility Documents, any amount which has become
due following the termination or close-out of any Hedging Agreement which constitutes a **Super**
**Senior Hedging Liability (being a Hedging Liability up to an agreed allocated super senior hedging**
amount) and, after the Credit Facility Lender Discharge Date, the amount that would be payable
under any of the Hedging Agreements which constitutes a Super Senior Hedging Liability and which
has not been terminated or been closed-out if the date of calculation were an early termination date
under such Hedging Agreements.

- the **Majority Pari Passu Creditors means, at any time, those lenders under any pari passu facility**
agreements (the Pari Passu Lenders), the Noteholders and any other holder from time to time of any
pari passu notes (the **Pari Passu Noteholders) and Pari Passu Hedge Counterparties holding more**
than 50% of any amount which has become due following the termination or close-out of any Hedging
Agreement which constitutes a Pari Passu Hedging Liability (being a Hedging Liability which is not a
Super Senior Hedging Liability) and, after the date of discharge in full of the Pari Passu Debt
Liabilities, the amount that would be payable under any of the Hedging Agreements which constitutes

193


-----

a Pari Passu Hedging Liability and which has not been terminated or been closed-out if the date of
calculation were an early termination date under such Hedging Agreements), commitments under the
pari passu facility agreements, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Notes held by it and
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of any Pari Passu Debt Liabilities (if not already captured
above) in respect of which it is the creditor.

**_Enforcement of Transaction Security_**

_Instructions to enforce_

Either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors (each an **Instructing**
**Group) can issue enforcement instructions to the Security Trustee. The creditor representatives (and if**
applicable the Hedge Counterparties) representing the Primary Creditors comprising the Majority Super
Senior Creditors or Majority Pari Passu Creditors shall deliver a copy of the proposed enforcement
instructions to the Security Trustee who shall promptly forward such notice to each other creditor
representative and Hedge Counterparty.

_Consultation_

Promptly following receipt of a notice of enforcement instructions by all relevant parties, the creditor
representative of the Super Senior Creditors (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior
Creditors), the creditor representative of the Pari Passu Creditors (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Pari Passu Creditors) and the Note Trustee will consult in good faith with each other and the
Security Trustee for a period of 10 Business Days from the date the notice of enforcement instructions are
received with a view to co-ordinating instructions to be given by the Instructing Group and agreeing an
enforcement strategy (the Consultation Period).

There shall be no obligation to consult (or, if the parties have agreed a proposed enforcement action, no
Consultation Period or a shorter consultation period as determined by those parties shall apply):

(a) if the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an insolvency in relation to any
Debtor; or

(b) if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Pari Passu Creditors determine in good faith
that to enter into such consultations and thereby delay the commencement of enforcement of the
Transaction Security could reasonably be expected to reduce the amount likely to be realised to a level
such that the Super Senior Liabilities would not be discharged in full and in this case any instructions
will be limited to those necessary to protect or preserve the interests of the Pari Passu Creditors or, as
the case may be, the Super Senior Creditors on behalf of which the relevant Instructing Group is
acting and the Security Trustee shall act in accordance with the instructions first received.

If following the Consultation Period, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and/or the Majority Pari Passu
Creditors have agreed on an enforcement strategy, the Security Trustee shall be instructed to implement
the same.

In the event that conflicting enforcement instructions have been received as at the end of or following the
Consultation Period, the Security Trustee shall enforce the Transaction Security and/or refrain from
enforcing the Transaction Security and/or take the relevant other enforcement action in accordance with
the instructions provided by the Majority Pari Passu Creditors, provided any such instructions to enforce
comply with the enforcement principles summarised in ‘‘—Enforcement Principles’’ below (the
**Enforcement Principles) (and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to assume that any instructions for**
enforcement given to it comply with the Enforcement Principles) and the terms of all instructions received
from the Majority Super Senior Creditors during the Consultation Period shall be deemed revoked.

Notwithstanding the above, if: (i) the Majority Pari Passu Creditors have not either not (A) notified the
Security Trustee of a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security
Trustee to pursue; or (B) appointed a financial adviser to assist them in making such a determination, in
each case within three months of the end of the Consultation Period, (ii) the date of discharge in full of the
Super Senior Liabilities (the Super Senior Discharge Date) has not occurred within six months of the end
of the Consultation Period or (iii) an insolvency event is continuing with respect to a Debtor, then the
Security Trustee will act in accordance with the enforcement instructions received from the Majority Super
Senior Creditors under the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred.

194

_Exercise of Voting Rights_

Each Primary Creditor, intra-group lender, the Parent Guarantor, AF3 and any other subordinated
creditor is required to cast its vote in any proposal put to the vote by or under the supervision of any
judicial or supervisory authority in respect of any insolvency, pre-insolvency, rehabilitation or similar
proceedings relating to any member of the Group as instructed by the Security Trustee (acting in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement).

**_Enforcement Principles_**

The Security Trustee shall enforce the Transaction Security or take other action as to enforcement in such
manner as the Instructing Group shall instruct (provided that such instructions are consistent with the
enforcement principles) or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Trustee considers in its
discretion to be appropriate and consistent with the enforcement principles.

The enforcement principles are set out in a schedule to the Intercreditor Agreement and provide, among
other things, that:

(a) it shall be the primary and over-riding aim of any enforcement to maximize, to the extent consistent
with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the value realized from enforcement;

(b) to the extent the Instructing Group is the Majority Super Senior Creditors, all proceeds of
enforcement are received by the Security Trustee in cash for distribution in accordance with the
section below entitled ‘‘—Application of Proceeds’’;

197


-----

**_Equalisation_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any of the Credit Facility Liabilities or
Super Senior Hedging Liabilities (the Super Senior Liabilities) remain unpaid after the enforcement date
and the resulting losses are not borne by the Credit Facility Lenders and Hedge Counterparties in the
proportions their respective exposures at the enforcement date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the
Credit Facility Lenders and Hedge Counterparties at the exposure date, the Credit Facility Lenders and
Hedge Counterparties will make such payments from such payments among themselves as the Security
Trustee shall require to put the Credit Facility Lenders and Hedge Counterparties in such a position that
(after taking into account such payments) their losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Option to Purchase_**

Following a Distress Event, some or all of the Pari Passu Noteholders and Pari Passu Lenders shall have an
option (subject to the conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) to purchase all (and not only
part) of the Credit Facility Liabilities.

**_Consents, Amendments and Override_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that it may be amended only with
the consent of each creditor representative, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Pari
Passu Creditors and the Security Trustee unless it is an amendment or waiver that has the effect of
changing or that relates to, among other things: (i) the order of priority or subordination under the
Intercreditor Agreement; or (ii) the provisions in respect of redistribution, the enforcement of Transaction
Security, the application of proceeds, amendments and waivers and certain instructions provisions, which
shall not be made without the consent of:

- the creditor representatives;

- the Credit Facility Lenders;

- each pari passu note trustee (the Pari Passu Note Trustee) on behalf of the Pari Passu Noteholders in
respect of which it is the creditor representative;

- the Pari Passu Lenders;

- each Hedge Counterparty (to the extent the amendment or waiver would adversely affect the Hedge
Counterparty); and

- the Security Trustee.

Subject to the above and certain other exceptions, no amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor
Agreement may impose new or additional obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party to
the Intercreditor Agreement without the prior written consent of that party.

Unless expressly stated otherwise in the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides
anything in the Hedging Agreements, Credit Facility Documents, Pari Passu Debt Documents, the
Transaction Security documents, the Intra-Group Liabilities or the Subordinated Liabilities or any other
document designated as a ‘‘Debt Document’’ (together the Debt Documents) to the contrary.

**_Amendments/waivers_**

The Pari Passu Creditors may amend or waive the terms of the Pari Passu Debt Documents in accordance
with their terms (subject to any consent required under them), except that no amendments can be made to
the amount or method of payment of interest or principal under any Pari Passu Debt Document and no
amendments can be made to the Pari Passu Debt Documents if this would result in the covenants and
defaults of the Pari Passu Debt Documents being more favourable to the Pari Passu Debt Creditors than
the Credit Facility Documents are to the Credit Facility Creditors unless equivalent changes are made in
the Credit Facility Documents.

**_‘‘Snooze you lose’’_**

Disposal unless made in accordance with a Remedial Plan (as defined below) or unless the Senior Trigger
Event has occurred and continuing solely as a result of a breach of the Senior Projected Trigger Event
Financial Covenant Ratios and subject to certain restrictions, provided that it can demonstrate that such
disposal is permitted under the terms of the Common Terms Agreement, the proceeds of such disposal are
used to repay Senior Debt in accordance with the Common Terms Agreement and such a disposal will
either cure or improve the relevant breach of Senior Projected Trigger Event Financial Covenant Ratios (a
**Disposal Cure).**

In addition, for so long as any Senior Debt is outstanding, if (i) one or both of the ratings assigned to the
Senior Notes (if the Senior Notes are rated by two rating agencies) or (ii) two or more ratings assigned to

continuing) to the extent that such Senior Restricted Payments are used exclusively to pay interest or
principal on the Subordinated Loans for the purpose of the Subordinated Lender paying interest or
principal to AF No 2 and AF No 2 (in its capacity as the Intercompany Borrower) paying interest and an
amount equal to the Issuer Senior Amounts to the Issuer (in its capacity as the Intercompany Lender) on
the Intercompany Loans and the Issuer paying interest on the Notes and the Issuer Senior Amounts (as
applicable).

_Senior Trigger Event Consequences_

If a Senior Trigger Event occurs and is continuing, no Senior Financing Group Company may make a
Senior Restricted Payment and the Senior Borrower will credit an account with an amount equal to all
Excess Cash Flow in respect of each previous Semi-Annual Test Period commencing following that Senior
Trigger Event and shall continue to credit such account (the Lock-Up Account) with an amount equal to all
Excess Cash Flow in respect of each subsequent Semi-Annual Test Period for so long as a Senior Trigger
Event is continuing.

In the event that a Senior Trigger Event has been subsisting for 12 months or more and for so long as any
Senior Debt remains outstanding then, AF No 1 shall apply all amounts then standing to the credit of the
Lock-Up Account in repayment of Senior Debt in accordance with the Common Terms Agreement.

In the event that the Senior Trigger Event is continuing for 6 months or more, the Senior Borrower must
discuss plans for remedial action with a view to agreeing a remedial plan (each a **Remedial Plan). Such**
Remedial Plan is to be reviewed and amended annually until such time as the relevant Senior Trigger
Event is no longer subsisting.

**Semi-Annual Test Period means the six months ending on any Test Date.**

(together, the Senior Borrower Hedges). In addition, the Senior Issuer may enter into Hedges with one or
more Issuer Hedge Counterparties from time to time (the **Senior Issuer Hedges, which expression**
excludes, for the avoidance of doubt, any Issuer/Borrower Hedges). Each Hedge Counterparty to any one
or more Senior Borrower Hedges will be party to the MDA, CTA and the STID and, in the case of the
Senior Issuer Hedges, the MDA, CTA, STID and the Issuer Deed of Charge.

The Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower must at all times comply with the Issuer/Borrower Hedging
Policy.

The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer may from time to time enter into back to back hedges which
match the terms of any Senior Issuer Hedges (the Issuer/Borrower Hedges).

_Hedged Debt Covenant_

_Interest Rate Hedging and Inflation Linked Hedging_

The Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower will ensure that at each Hedging Test Date, the amount equal
to:

(a) the sum of:

(i) the total outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes and the Borrower Loans (excluding
any Issuer/Borrower Loans) which either:

(A) bear interest at a fixed rate; or

(B) pay a return that is index-linked to inflation; and

213

(ii) the aggregate notional amount of all outstanding Interest Rate Hedges and Inflation Linked
Hedges which are entered into by either the Senior Issuer or the Senior Borrower (excluding any
Issuer/Borrower Hedges) (together, the Rate Hedges), less

(b) the aggregate notional amount of: (x) any Offsetting Hedges and the portion (which may be a part or
the entirety) of any Primary Hedges which have been offset by such Offsetting Hedges, (y) any
Overlay Hedges and (z) any Inflation Linked Hedges in respect of which the Senior Borrower or the
Senior Issuer (as applicable) receives a fixed rate of interest,

is not less than 80% and not more than 105% of the total outstanding principal amount of the Senior
Notes and the Borrower Loans (excluding any Issuer/Borrower Loans) for the period up to (and including)
the day that is five years from such Hedging Test Date.

The Senior Issuer and the Senior Borrower will ensure that at each Hedging Test Date the amount equal
to:

(a) the sum of:

(i) the total outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes and the Borrower Loans (excluding
any Issuer/Borrower Loans) which either:

(A) bear interest at a fixed rate; or

(B) pay a return that is index-linked to inflation; and

(ii) the aggregate notional amount of all outstanding Rate Hedges, less

(b) the aggregate notional amount of: (x) any Offsetting Hedges and the portion (which may be a part or
the entirety) of any Primary Hedges which have been offset by such Offsetting Hedges, (y) any
Overlay Hedges and (z) any Inflation Linked Hedges in respect of which the Senior Borrower or the
Senior Issuer (as applicable) receives a fixed rate of interest,

is not less than 75% and not more than 110% of the total outstanding principal amount of the Senior
Notes and the Borrower Loans (excluding any Issuer/Borrower Loans) for the period up to (and including)
the day that is seven years from such Hedging Test Date (the preceding two paragraphs, the Rate Hedged
**Debt Covenant).**

_Currency Hedging_

If any Senior Notes and Borrower Loans (excluding any Issuer/Borrower Loans) are denominated in a
currency other than sterling, the Senior Borrower and/or the Senior Issuer (as applicable) will enter into
Currency Hedges in respect of such foreign currency with an aggregate notional amount equal to 100% of
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Senior Notes and Borrower Loans denominated in
such foreign currency until the Final Maturity Date or any equivalent or analogous maturity date of such
Senior Notes and Borrower Loans. Such Currency Hedges will cover interest and principal payments
under the relevant Senior Notes and Borrower Loans (excluding Issuer/Borrower Loans) (the **Currency**
**Hedged Debt Covenant and together with the Rate Hedged Debt Covenant, the Hedged Debt Covenant).**

_General_

No hedging is permitted for speculative purposes, but the Senior Borrower and/or another Obligor may
enter into general foreign exchange trades or interest rate risk management trades in the ordinary course
of business (which shall be considered Permitted Treasury Transactions).

_Ranking of Hedging Agreements_

Any liability of the Senior Issuer under the Senior Issuer Hedges (other than Excluded Hedge
Counterparty Amounts) will rank senior to (Super Senior Issuer Hedges) or pari passu with (Pari Passu
**Issuer Hedges) the Senior Notes, as more fully set out in the provisions relating to the priority of payments**
applicable to the Senior Issuer in the Common Documents. Any liability of the Senior Borrower under the
Senior Borrower Hedges will rank senior to (Super Senior Borrower Hedges) or pari passu with (Pari
**Passu Borrower Hedges) the Borrower Facilities (other than the Liquidity Facility, which will rank senior**
thereto except for Excluded Liquidity Facility Provider Amounts), as more fully set out in the provisions
relating to the order of priority of payments applicable to the Senior Borrower in the Common
Documents. Pari Passu Issuer Hedges will be subject to a Pari Passu Issuer Hedging Agreement. Pari Passu

214


-----

Borrower Hedges will be subject to a Pari Passu Borrower Hedging Agreement. Super Senior Issuer
Hedges will be subject to a Super Senior Issuer Hedging Agreement. Super Senior Borrower Hedges will
be subject to a Super Senior Borrower Hedging Agreement. Accordingly, if a Hedge Counterparty enters
into more than one such category of Hedges, it must enter into a separate Hedging Agreement with the
Senior Borrower or the Senior Issuer (as applicable) in respect of each category of Hedges.

The ranking of each Hedging Agreement shall be specified as such in that Hedging Agreement.

_Hedging (with Breaks) Condition_

The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer may enter into Hedges with Hedge Counterparties that contain
mandatory break clauses (each a Hedge with Break Clause and together the Hedges with Break Clauses),
provided that (i) the aggregate notional amount of all Hedges with Break Clauses does not exceed 10% of
Senior Debt and (ii) the mandatory break clause is on or after the tenth anniversary of the entry into such
Hedge with Break Clause. For the purpose of calculating the aggregate notional amount of all Hedges with
Break Clauses, the following will not be included (i) any Offsetting Hedges and any Hedges which have
been offset by such Offsetting Hedges and (ii) any Overlay Hedges.

_Overhedging_

The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer may at any time reduce in part or in whole the notional amount
of any Senior Borrower Hedges and Senior Issuer Hedges respectively and of any corresponding Issuer/
Borrower Hedges (as required) (a **Reduction), provided that the Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer**
remain in compliance with the Hedged Debt Covenant.

In the event that the Senior Borrower or the Senior Issuer on any Hedging Test Date is overhedged
pursuant to the above Hedged Debt Covenant (an **Overhedged Position), the Senior Borrower or the**
Senior Issuer (as applicable) must reduce the notional amount of the relevant Currency Hedges or Rate
Hedges (as applicable) in accordance with the terms of the relevant Hedging Agreement so that
immediately following such Reductions it is in compliance with the above Hedged Debt Covenant.

In the event that an Overhedged Position arises or will arise by virtue of proceeds from a disposal being
applied towards repayment of the Senior Debt, the Senior Borrower or the Senior Issuer must effect
immediate Reductions across the relevant Currency Hedges or Rate Hedges (as applicable) in accordance
with the terms of the relevant Hedging Agreement such that, following such Reductions, the Senior
Borrower or the Senior Issuer (as applicable) is in compliance with the Hedged Debt Covenant.

In respect of any Reduction in relation to a Rate Hedge or Currency Hedge (respectively), in the event
that the relevant Hedge Counterparty is in-the-money in respect of such Rate Hedge or Currency Hedge
(as applicable), the Senior Borrower or Senior Issuer (as applicable) shall pay to the relevant Hedge
Counterparty the mark-to-market close-out value in respect of the portion of such Rate Hedge or
Currency Hedge (as applicable) being reduced or terminated.

The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer may enter into one or more Offsetting Hedges which will be
used for the purposes of determining whether or not it is overhedged. Senior FinCo may not enter into any
Offsetting Hedges.

_Cap on Super Senior Borrower Hedges and Super Senior Issuer Hedges_

The Senior Borrower and the Senior Issuer may not enter Super Senior Borrower Hedges and Super
Senior Issuer Hedges (other than Overlay Hedges or Offsetting Hedges) if the risk-weighted notional
amount of existing Super Senior Borrower Hedges and Super Senior Issuer Hedges is more than 50% of
the outstanding principal amount of the Borrower Loans and Senior Notes. The risk-weighting of the
existing Super Senior Borrower Hedges and Super Senior Issuer Hedges will be determined by reference
to their mark-to-market value.

**OVERVIEW OF SENIOR HEDGES**

As at 30 June 2018, the Group had a hedging portfolio with a notional amount of approximately
£3.1 billion. This portfolio comprises approximately:

- £1.3 billion notional amount of inflation linked swaps (ILS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;

- £0.6 billion notional amount of overlay swaps (OS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;

- £0.2 billion notional amount of cross-currency swaps (CCS) to which the Senior Borrower is party;
and

- £1.0 billion notional amount of IRS to which the Senior Borrower is party.

As at such date, FinCo was not party to any swaps.

The summary terms of the hedging portfolio, as at 30 June 2018, are as follows:

**_Senior Borrower ILS and Senior Borrower OS_**

The existing ILS (which have a total notional amount of approximately £1.3 billion) are used to hedge the
Group’s high proportion of index-linked turnover. The mark-to-market value on the ILS is linked to future
expectations of inflation. As the Group’s long-term contracts are closely linked to the RPI, higher inflation
tends to increase future turnover and offsets the impact of mark-to-market deterioration on the ILS over
the life of the swap.

In addition, the Senior Borrower has entered into approximately £0.6 billion notional amount of floating/
fixed interest rate swaps (i.e. OS) to overlay the ILS (with no mandatory break and having a floating
receive leg of six month GBP LIBOR) and thereby amend the net cash flow characteristics.

217


-----

Approximately £1.1 billion notional amount of ILS after directly or in conjunction with a portion of the OS
(£0.4 billion notional amount) effectively hedges the Senior Issuer’s and the Senior PP Issuer’s fixed rate
GBP coupon payments under the existing fixed rate Senior Notes and the existing fixed rate GBP tranche
of the Senior USPP Notes, respectively. The remaining £0.2 billion notional amount of ILS in conjunction
with the CCS and a portion of the OS (£0.2 billion notional amount) effectively hedges the Senior PP
Issuer’s cross-currency exchange rate and interest rate risk in respect of the existing U.S. dollar tranche of
the Senior USPP Notes. Approximately £1.1 billion of the ILS do not have mandatory breaks and so will
mature on their scheduled maturity date falling in 2027. The remaining £0.2 billion of the ILS have a
mandatory break date falling in 2023. At that mandatory break date, these ILS will automatically terminate
and the Senior Borrower will be obliged to pay any termination costs. The termination costs for the Senior
Borrower will be linked to the mark-to-market value of such portion of the ILS at such time. The Senior
Borrower expects to fund the potential termination costs with cash and/or further Senior Debt.
Alternatively, the Senior Borrower may be able to extend the mandatory break, subject to an incremental
credit charge and the willingness of the relevant Senior Hedge Counterparties that are counterparties
under the ILS in extending such break. The mandatory breaks were introduced to optimise the rate paid by
the Senior Borrower under the ILS. None of the OS have any mandatory breaks and so will mature on
their scheduled maturity date (subject to any scheduled amortisation, if applicable).

On the ILS, the coupon is paid in cash at each semi-annual payment date and is accounted for in the
Senior Historic Cashflow ICR and the Senior Projected Cashflow ICR (together, the **Senior ICRs). The**
accretion amount to the notional amount which is determined by indexation to inflation is counted as
Senior Net Debt in the Senior Historic Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio and the Senior Projected Net Debt to
EBITDA Ratio, but not in the Senior ICRs.

The Senior Borrower is required to pay down accretion amounts every year until maturity of the ILS. The
Senior Borrower expects to fund this payment from available cash and/or the incurring of new Senior Debt.

The accretion payment on the ILS is calculated according to the following formula:

{([RPI (3 month lag) / 201.6 - 1] � ILS notional) minus the sum of all previous accretion payments}.

Assuming inflation is 3.0% from the 30 June 2018 RPI fixing until 30 June 2019, the accretion paydown on
that date would be approximately £553 million ([286.6 / 201.6 - 1] � £1,312.5 million) minus approximately
£499 million (aggregate accretion repayments paid as at June 2018) = approximately £54 million.

The interest payments on the ILS are calculated according to the following formula:

{[RPI (3 month lag) / 201.6] � ILS notional � real rate � fraction of year}

As an example, to calculate the semi-annual interest coupon payable at 30 June 2019 on the ILS, the
calculation is as follows:

{[286.6 / 201.6] � £0.2 billion � 2.8% � 0.5} = approximately £4.6 million cash interest cost

{[286.6 / 201.6] � £1.1 billion � 3.0% � 0.5} = approximately £22.5 million cash interest cost

(1) 286.6 is the approximate RPI fixing at 30 June 2019 with 3 month lag assuming 3% annual inflation from 30 June 2018 RPI
fixing until 30 June 2019.

Management estimates that, as at 30 June 2018, the mark-to-market value on the ILS was approximately
£0.8 billion and the PV01 (as explained above) on the ILS was approximately £1.8 million. The PV01
represents the present value of adding one basis point to the fixed rate payable by the Senior Borrower and
is a function of interest rates and time (which means that the PV01 will vary from time to time).

**_Senior Borrower CCS_**

The Senior Borrower has entered into $0.4 billion notional amount of CCS to fix the sterling cost of future
interest and capital repayment obligations relating to the U.S. dollar tranche of the Senior USPP Notes at
an exchange rate of USD1.52:GBP1.00.

**_Senior Borrower IRS_**

The Senior Borrower has entered into approximately £1.0 billion notional amount of IRS to hedge the
floating rate payable by the Senior Borrower under the Senior Group’s floating rate GBP debt, specifically
the Senior Institutional Term Loan, the Senior EIB Loan, the Senior Term Facility and the floating rate
GBP tranches of the Senior USPP Notes. None of the Senior Borrower IRS contains any mandatory break

218


-----

provisions and instead the maturity date of each such Senior Borrower IRS corresponds to the scheduled
maturity of the aforementioned Senior Debt that it hedges (subject to any scheduled amortisation, if
applicable).

The Senior Borrower IRS represents restructured legacy instruments, meaning that the fixed rate payable
by the Senior Borrower is higher than it would be had the Senior Borrower entered into new swaps on
on-market terms when the derivative instruments were established.

certifications as may be required by the Registrar or, as the case may be, by the Transfer Agent and (b) the
Registrar or the Transfer Agent must, after due and careful enquiry, be satisfied with the documents of title
and the identity of the person making the request. Any such transfer will be subject to such reasonable
regulations as the Issuer, the Note Trustee and the Registrar may from time to time prescribe (the initial
such regulations being set out in Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 of the Agency Agreement). Subject as
provided above, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent will, within three business days (being for this purpose

applicable fiscal or other laws or regulations), authenticate and deliver, or procure the authentication and
delivery of, at its specified office to the transferee or (at the risk of the transferee) send by uninsured mail
to such address as the transferee may request, a new Note in definitive form of a like aggregate nominal
amount to the Note (or the relevant part of the Note) transferred. In the case of the transfer of part only of
a Note in definitive form, a new Note in definitive form in respect of the balance of the Note not
transferred will be so authenticated and delivered or (at the risk of the transferor) sent to the transferor.

**2.3. Registration of transfer upon partial redemption**

All transfers of Notes and entries on the register are subject to the detailed regulations concerning the
transfer of Notes scheduled to the Agency Agreement. The regulations may be changed by the Issuer with
the prior written approval of the Principal Paying Agent, the Note Trustee and the Registrar. A copy of the
current regulations will be mailed (free of charge) by the Registrar to any Noteholder who requests in
writing a copy of such regulations.

**2.5. Cost of registration**

Noteholders will not be required to bear the costs and expenses of effecting any registration of transfer as
provided above, except for any cost or expenses of delivery other than by regular uninsured mail and
except that the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any stamp duty, tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation to the registration.

**2.6. Transfers of interests in Global Notes**

2.6.1 Prior to expiry of the applicable Distribution Compliance Period, transfers by the holder of, or of a
beneficial interest in, a Global Note to a transferee in the United States or who is a U.S. person will
only be made pursuant to the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, subject to receipt by the
Issuer of such satisfactory evidence as the Issuer may reasonably require, which may include an
opinion of U.S. counsel, that such transfer is in compliance with any applicable securities laws of
any state of the United States, and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of
the United States or any other jurisdiction.

2.6.2 After expiry of the applicable Distribution Compliance Period (A) beneficial interests in Global
Notes registered in the name of a nominee of the common depository for Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg may be held directly or indirectly through a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg and (B) such certification requirements will no longer apply to such transfers.

**2.7. Exchanges and transfers of Notes generally**

The Notes are direct, secured, unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank _pari_
_passu without any preference among themselves and_ _pari passu with any Indebtedness Incurred by the_
Issuer from time to time that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and senior to any
Subordinated Debt or intra-Group liabilities.

**3.2. Status of the Guarantees**

The payment of principal and interest in respect of the Notes and all other moneys payable by the Issuer
under or pursuant to the Note Trust Deed has been unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Arqiva
Financing No 2 Limited (the **Intermediate Guarantor), Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited (the** **Parent**
**Guarantor) and Arqiva Broadcast Intermediate Limited (the Intermediate HoldCo and, together with the**

are contained in the Note Trust Deed and are secured pursuant to the Security Agreement.

**3.3. Transaction Security**

3.3.1 The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured by first ranking fixed and floating security interests
over all (or substantially all) of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including (1) the shares
in each of the Issuer and the Intermediate Guarantor held by the Parent Guarantor, (2) the shares
in Intermediate HoldCo held by the Intermediate Guarantor and (3) the shares in Arqiva Group
Parent Limited held by Intermediate HoldCo.

3.3.2 The security constituted by the Security Agreement is granted by the Issuer and the Guarantors to

In the event of an issue of Further Notes (as defined in Condition 16.1 (Further Notes), the provisions of
these Conditions, the Note Trust Deed, the Security Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, will
be modified in such manner as the Note Trustee or, as the case may be, the Security Trustee considers
necessary to reflect the issue of such Further Notes and any new Transaction Documents entered into in
connection with such Further Notes and the ranking thereof and of the claims of any party to any of such
new Transaction Documents in relation to each class of the Notes.

**3.6. Note Trustee not responsible for monitoring compliance**

The Note Trustee shall not be responsible for monitoring compliance by the Issuer or any other Obligor
with any of its obligations under the Note Trust Deed or the other Transaction Documents except by means
of receipt of a certificate from the Issuer which will state, among other things, that no Event of Default is
outstanding. The Note Trustee shall be entitled to rely on such certificates absolutely. The Note Trustee is
not responsible for monitoring compliance by any of the parties with their respective obligations under the
Note Trust Deed or the other Transaction Documents. The Note Trustee may call for and is at liberty to
accept as sufficient evidence a certificate signed by any one authorised signatory director of the Issuer or
any other party to the Note Trust Deed or other Transaction Documents to the effect that any particular
dealing, transaction, step or thing is in the opinion of the persons so certifying suitable or expedient or as
to any other fact or matter upon which the Note Trustee may require to be satisfied. The Note Trustee is in
no way bound to call for further evidence or be responsible to any person for any loss that may be

occasioned by acting on any such certificate although the same may contain some error or is not authentic.
The Note Trustee is entitled to rely upon any certificate believed by it to be genuine and will not be liable
for so acting.

**4.** **COVENANTS**

**4.1. Indebtedness**

4.1.1 None of the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall Incur any Indebtedness, provided that the Issuer and
the Guarantors may Incur Indebtedness if, on the date of such Incurrence, the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0 determined on a pro forma basis (including a
pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom) as if the additional Indebtedness had been
Incurred and the application of proceeds therefrom had occurred at the beginning of the relevant
Test Period.

4.1.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing Condition 4.1.1, the Issuer and the Guarantors may Incur any or all
of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, the Permitted Debt):

(1) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness under Credit Facilities in
an aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding under this clause (1) not to
exceed £20 million, plus in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under
this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts,
premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such refinancing;

(2) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes
(other than Further Notes) and the related Guarantees (including any future Guarantees);

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors outstanding on the Issue Date (other than
the Indebtedness described in clauses (1) or (2) of this Condition 4.1.2) after giving _pro_
_forma effect to the use of proceeds of the Notes Incurred on the Issue Date as set forth in_
the Offering Memorandum;

(4) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in
exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to renew, refund, refinance, replace,
defease or discharge any Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was
permitted by these Conditions to be Incurred under Condition 4.1.1 or clauses (2), (3) or
(4) of this Condition 4.1.2;

(5) the Incurrence by the Issuer or a Guarantor of intercompany Indebtedness owed to or held
by another Group Company; provided that:

(a) if the Issuer or any Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and the payee is
not the Issuer or a Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be unsecured and expressly
subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the
Notes, in the case of the Issuer, or the Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such
Indebtedness being held by a Person other than a Group Company and (ii) any sale
or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not a Group Company,
will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the
Issuer or such Guarantor, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this
clause (5);

(6) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of obligations under Interest Rate Treasury
Transactions not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Issuer or a
Guarantor, as the case may be);

(7) the guarantee by the Issuer or a Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor to
the extent that the guaranteed Indebtedness was permitted to be Incurred by another
provision of this Condition 4.1; provided that if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to the Notes or subordinated to or _pari passu with a Guarantee, then the_
guarantee must be subordinated, in the case of the Notes or subordinated to or pari passu, as
applicable, in the case of a Guarantee, in each case to the same extent as the Indebtedness
guaranteed;

224


-----

(8) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness arising from the honoring
by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument inadvertently
drawn against insufficient funds, so long as such Indebtedness is covered within five Business
Days of such Incurrence; and

(9) the Incurrence by the Issuer and the Guarantors of Indebtedness in respect of (a) any
customary cash management, cash pooling or netting or setting-off arrangements, including
customary credit card facilities; and (b) any guarantee given in respect of the netting or
set-off arrangements permitted pursuant to the definition of Permitted Liens.

4.1.3 For purposes of determining compliance with this Condition 4.1, in the event that an item of
Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clause (1) through (9) of Condition 4.1.2, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to Condition 4.1.1,
the Parent Guarantor, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness
on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such
Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide
and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
Conditions 4.1.1 and 4.1.2, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of
Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this Condition 4.1; _provided that Indebtedness_
Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of Condition 4.1.2 may not be reclassified. Indebtedness under the
Liquidity Facility outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date
in reliance on the exception provided in Condition 4.1.2(1). The accrual of interest or Disqualified
Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on
any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of Capital Stock as
Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on
Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be
an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this Condition 4.1.

4.1.4 For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the
Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling-Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term
Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (1) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-sterling currency is subject to a
Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling
will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement; and (2) the Sterling-Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the
same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the Sterling-Equivalent of the
Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except
that to the extent that

(1) such Sterling-Equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection
Agreement, in which case the refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance
with the preceding sentence; and

(2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the
Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the Sterling-Equivalent of such excess will be
determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred.

4.1.5 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Condition 4.1, the maximum amount of Indebtedness
that the Issuer or a Guarantor may Incur pursuant to this Condition 4.1 shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

4.1.6 The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability
in respect thereof determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles; and

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

225


-----

4.1.7 For purposes of these Conditions, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Historic Net Debt to EBITDA
Ratio and Historic Senior Secured Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio will be calculated in accordance
with the Accounting Principles.

**4.2. Restricted Payments**

4.2.1 None of the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the

connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Issuer or a Guarantor) or to the
direct or indirect holders of the Equity Interests of the Issuer or a Guarantor in their
capacity as holders or otherwise to any Holding Company of the Parent Guarantor or any
Subsidiary of such Holding Company (not being a Group Company) or any Shareholder or
any Shareholder Affiliate, other than (i) dividends or distributions payable in Equity
Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor or in Subordinated Debt;

of interest or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or (ii) the purchase, repurchase or
other acquisition of Indebtedness purchased in anticipation of satisfying a scheduled sinking
fund obligation, principal installment or scheduled maturity, in each case due within one
year of the date of such purchase, repurchase or other acquisition;

(4) make any cash payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire for value any Subordinated Debt; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment,

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (5) above being

distribution or redemption payment would have complied with these Conditions;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash
proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale or issuance (other than to a Group Company)
of, Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor (other than Disqualified Stock), Subordinated
Debt or from the substantially concurrent contribution of common equity capital to the
Parent Guarantor; provided that the amount of any such net cash proceeds that are utilized
for any such Restricted Payment will not be considered to be net cash proceeds from an
Equity Offering for purposes of Condition 6.2.1;

(3) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor that is contractually subordinated to the Note

Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of such subordinated Indebtedness;

(4) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise of stock options or
warrants to the extent such Equity Interests represent a portion of the exercise price of those
stock options or warrants;

extent required by the agreements governing such Indebtedness at a purchase price not
greater than 101% of the principal amount of such Indebtedness, in the case of a Change of
Control, and 100%, in the case of a Disposition, but only if the Issuer has complied with its
obligations under Conditions 6.4 and 4.8.2 and the Issuer repurchased all Notes tendered
pursuant to the offer required by Conditions 6.4 and 4.8.2 prior to offering to purchase,
purchasing or repaying such Indebtedness;

(9) so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any Restricted
Payments; provided that the Historic Net Debt to EBITDA Ratio does not exceed 6.5 to 1.0

transaction; and

(10) a payment pursuant to a Permitted Tax Transaction.

4.2.3 The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date
of the Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by the
Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

**4.3. Liens**

4.3.1 None of the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall, directly or indirectly, create, Incur, assume or otherwise
cause or suffer to exist or become effective any Lien of any kind securing Indebtedness upon any of
their property or assets, now owned or hereafter acquired (such Lien, the Initial Lien), except (1) in
the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral (a) Permitted Liens, or (b) if
such Lien is not a Permitted Lien, to the extent that all payments due under the Note Trust Deed,
the Notes and the Guarantees are secured on an equal and ratable basis (or in the case of
Indebtedness which is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or any Guarantees, prior or
senior thereto, with the same relative priority as the Notes or such Guarantee, as applicable, shall
have with respect to such subordinated Indebtedness) with the obligations so secured until such
time as such obligations are no longer secured by a Lien and (2) in the case of any property or asset
that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

4.3.2 Any such Lien created in favour of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(b) of Condition 4.3.1 will be

**4.8. Dispositions**

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Conditions:

4.8.1 _Corporate reorganisation within Group_

A Senior Financing Group Company may sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of a business
division or other assets (including the Equity Interests of a Subsidiary owning such business division
or other assets) to the Issuer, any Guarantor or any of their respective direct Subsidiaries, provided
that (A) such transferred business division, assets and/or Equity Interests are subject to the
Transaction Security and (B) in the case of a transfer of Equity Interests of a Subsidiary, such
Subsidiary is or becomes wholly owned by the Issuer and/or the Guarantors.

4.8.2 _Disposition by Issuer, Guarantor or Senior Financing Group Company_

(1) The Issuer, a Guarantor or a Senior Financing Group Company may sell, lease, transfer or
otherwise dispose of a business division or other assets (including the Equity Interests of a
Subsidiary owning such business division or other assets) to a Person that is not a Group
Company (each, a Disposition) if:

Equity Interests issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(b) at least 75% of the consideration received in the Disposition by the Issuer, Guarantor
or Senior Financing Group Company is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For
purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet that would be recorded on
the next balance sheet) of any Group Company (other than contingent
liabilities and other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated in right
of payment to the Notes or any Guarantee), that are assumed by the transferee
of any such assets and as a result of which the Group is no longer obligated
with respect to such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Group Company that is
no longer a Group Company as a result of such Disposition, if each Group
Company is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of
such Disposition;

(ii) any securities, notes or other obligations received by any Group Company
from such transferee that are converted by such Group Company into cash or
Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the Disposition, to
the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in that conversion;

(iii) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in Condition 4.8.2(2)(a)(iv)
or (vi); and

(iv) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of any Group Company of a type set
forth in Condition 4.8.2(2)(a), received from Persons who are not a Group
Company.

231


-----

(2) Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from a Disposition, the Issuer, any
Guarantor or any Group Company may:

(a) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Issuer, such Guarantor or such Group
Company):

(i) to purchase the Notes pursuant to an offer made on a pro rata basis to all of
the holders of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of purchase (a Notes Offer) or to redeem the Notes pursuant
to Condition 6.2;

(ii) (A) to repay Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor Incurred under
Condition 4.1.2(1) or (B) to repay any Senior Debt of the Senior Financing
Group (and any corresponding Indebtedness of the Senior Issuer) and, in each
case, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(iii) to purchase, prepay or redeem or repay any Indebtedness that is only secured
by Liens on assets or property that do not constitute Collateral and, if the
Indebtedness prepaid, redeemed or repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(iv) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of,
another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of
Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Subsidiary (subject, in
the case of an acquisition by the Issuer or a Guarantor, to compliance with
Condition 4.4.6);

(v) to make a capital expenditure;

(vi) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock, cash and Cash Equivalents)
that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or

(vii) any combination of the foregoing; or

(b) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to
paragraphs (iv), (v) or (vi) of Condition 4.8.2(2)(a); provided that such commitment
shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such
commitment until the earlier of (i) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure
is consummated, and (ii) the 180th day following the expiration of the
aforementioned 365 day period.

(3) Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer, a Guarantor or another Group
Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net
Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Conditions.

(4) Any Net Proceeds from Dispositions that are not applied, invested or subject to a Notes
Offer as provided in Condition 4.8.2(2) will constitute Excess Proceeds. When the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £50 million, within 10 Business Days thereof, or at any
earlier time at the Issuer’s election, the Issuer will make an offer (a Disposition Offer) to all
holders of Notes and, to the extent notified by the Issuer in such notice, make an offer to all
holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes or any Guarantee to
purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, the maximum principal
amount of Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the
Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in
connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess
Proceeds. The offer price for the Notes in any Disposition Offer will be equal to 100% of the
principal amount and the offer price for any pari passu Indebtedness may be no greater than
100% of the principal amount, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of
holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after
consummation of a Disposition Offer or any Net Proceeds subject to a Notes Offer remain

232


-----

after consummation of a Notes Offer, the Issuer, the Guarantors and any other Group
Company may use those Excess Proceeds or Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Conditions. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other pari
passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such
Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of
Notes tendered pursuant to a Notes Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so
applied, the Notes will be selected in the manner described under Condition 6.5, based on
the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. The Issuer shall procure the
delivery by an agent to the Noteholders of the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and
not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the appropriate amounts of Notes from such
Noteholders’ accounts with the relevant clearing systems. Any Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Noteholder
thereof. Upon completion of each Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be
reset at zero. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issuer may make a Disposition Offer prior to
the expiration of the 365-day period referred to above. None of the Paying Agent, the Note
Trustee nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with or
pursuant to this paragraph.

(5) To the extent that any portion of Net Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes is
denominated in a currency other than pound sterling, as the case may be, the amount thereof
payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in pound sterling
that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Proceeds into
pound sterling.

(6) The Issuer will comply with the requirements of any applicable securities laws and
regulations to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Disposition Offer or a Notes Offer. To the extent
that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control,
Disposition Offer or Notes Offer provisions of these Conditions, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Conditions by virtue of such compliance.

**4.9. Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

4.9.1 In connection with the Incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer
that is permitted to share the Collateral, the Note Trustee and the Security Trustee shall, at the
written request of the Issuer and without the consent of the Noteholders, enter into with the Issuer
and/or the relevant Subsidiary and the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorised
representatives) one or more intercreditor agreements or deeds (including a restatement,
replacement, amendment or other modification of the Intercreditor Agreement) (an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement), on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or
terms as the Note Trustee in its absolute discretion shall deem to be not materially less beneficial to
the Noteholders), including with respect to release of Guarantees and priority and release of
security interests in respect of the Collateral; provided that such Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Note Trustee or Security Trustee or, in
the reasonable opinion of the Note Trustee or Security Trustee, adversely affect the personal rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnification or immunities of the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee under
the Trust Deed, these Conditions or the Intercreditor Agreement. In connection with the foregoing,
the Issuer shall furnish to the Note Trustee and the Security Trustee such documentation in relation
thereto as it may reasonably require.

In the event that the the Additional Intercreditor Agreement is not substantially on the same terms
as the Intercreditor Agreement and (i) the Note Trustee determines that the terms of the
Additional Intercreditor Agreement are materially less beneficial to the Noteholders or (ii) the
Note Trustee is unable to determine that the terms of the Additional Intercreditor Agreement are
not materially less beneficial to the Noteholders, the Note Trustee shall only enter into the
Additional Intercreditor Agreement if it is approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of the
Noteholders.

4.9.2 At the written request of the Issuer and without the consent of the Noteholders, the Note Trustee
and the Security Trustee shall from time to time concur in making one or more amendments and/or

233


-----

restatements to the Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement that
the Issuer determines is necessary for the purpose of: (1) the Incurrence of Indebtedness permitted
under these Conditions (including the addition of provisions relating to new types of Indebtedness),
(2) adding Guarantors or other parties (such as representatives of new Incurrences of
Indebtedness) thereto, (3) permitting payments to be made to the Issuer that would not otherwise
have been permitted pursuant to the terms thereof, (4) further securing the Notes, (5) making
provision for equal and ratable Security over the Collateral to secure Further Notes and (6) making
provisions for Security over the Collateral to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens (each such
amendment and/or restatement to the Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement being an ICA Amendment), provided that:

(1) the Issuer certifies to the Note Trustee and the Security Trustee in writing that such
amendment(s) and/or restatement to the Intercreditor Agreement or any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement is solely for the purpose set out in the relevant paragraph above of
this Condition 4.9.2 (the ICA Amendment Certificate);

(2) the Issuer pays (or arranges for the payment of) all fees, costs and expenses (including legal
fees) incurred by the Note Trustee and the Security Trustee in connection with such ICA
Amendment;

(3) the Note Trustee shall not consider the interests of the Noteholders, any other Secured
Creditor or any other person and shall act and rely solely and without investigation or
liability on any ICA Amendment Certificate or other certificate or evidence provided to it by
the Issuer and shall not be liable to the Noteholders, any other Secured Creditor or any
other person for so acting or relying; and

(4) neither the Note Trustee nor the Security Trustee shall be obliged to agree to any
amendment which, in the sole opinion of the Note Trustee and/or the Security Trustee would
have the effect of (i) exposing the Note Trustee and/or the Security Trustee to any liability
against which it has not been indemnified and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its
satisfaction or (ii) increasing the obligations or duties, or decreasing the rights, powers,
authorisations, discretions, indemnification or protections, of the Note Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee in the Transaction Documents and/or these Conditions.

4.9.3 Neither the Note Trustee nor the Security Trustee shall be responsible or liable in damages or
otherwise to any party or person for any loss incurred by reason of the Note Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee consenting to or concurring in such amendments, modifications and/or
restatements.

4.9.4 The Issuer shall not otherwise request the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee to enter into any
amendment to the Intercreditor Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, except to the extent approved by an Extraordinary Resolution of the Noteholders or as
permitted by the terms of such Intercreditor Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

4.9.5 Each Noteholder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and to have accepted the
terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(including, in each case, the limitations on payment, enforcement and the obligations to turnover
contained therein) whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described in this Condition 4.9, and to have authorised the Note Trustee and the Security
Trustee to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement on
each Noteholder’s behalf.

4.9.6 The Conditions are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

**5.** **INTEREST**

**5.1. Accrual of interest**

Each Note (or in the case of the redemption of part only of a Note, that part only of such Note) will cease
to bear interest (if any) from and including the date for its redemption unless upon due presentation in

234


-----

accordance with Condition 7 (Payments), payment of principal is improperly withheld or refused. In such
event, interest will continue to accrue until whichever is the earlier of:

5.1.1 the date on which all amounts due in respect of such Note have been paid and/or all assets
deliverable in respect of the Transaction Security have been delivered; and

5.1.2 five days after the date on which the full amount of the moneys payable in respect of such Note has
been received by the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar, as the case may be, and notice to that
effect has been given to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).

**5.2. Interest Rate and Interest Payment Dates**

The Notes bear interest on their respective Outstanding Principal Amounts from and including the Issue
Date at the rate of % per annum (the Interest Rate), payable semi-annually in arrear on 31 March
and 30 September (each an **Interest Payment Date) in respect of the Interest Period (as defined below)**
ended immediately prior thereto. The first payment shall be due on 31 March 2019. The period from (and
including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period
from (and including) an Interest Payment Date to (but excluding) the next succeeding Interest Payment
Date is called an Interest Period.

**5.3. Calculation of Fixed Rate Interest**

Interest in respect of the Notes shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of 12 months of
30 days each and, in the case of an incomplete month, the number of days elapsed on the basis of a month
of 30 days.

The interest amount payable by the Issuer for any Interest Period shall be calculated by:

5.3.1 while the Notes are represented by a Global Note, multiplying the Interest Rate by the Outstanding
Principal Amount of the Notes represented by such Global Note; or

5.3.2 while the Notes are in definitive form, for any given definitive note, multiplying the Interest Rate by
the Outstanding Principal Amount of such definitive note.

The resulting figure shall be rounded downwards to the nearest penny.

**6.1. Final Redemption**

If any class of the Notes have not previously been redeemed in full, or purchased and cancelled, the Notes
will be finally redeemed at the then Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest on

principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the rights of holders of the Notes on the relevant record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date), with the net cash proceeds of an
Equity Offering of (1) the Parent Guarantor or (2) any Holding Company of the Parent Guarantor
to the extent the proceeds from such Equity Offering are contributed to the Parent Guarantor’s
common equity capital or are paid to the Parent Guarantor as consideration for the issuance of
ordinary shares of the Parent Guarantor or as Subordinated Debt; provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, originally issued under the Note
Trust Deed (excluding the Notes held by the Issuer or a Guarantor) remains outstanding
immediately after the occurrence of such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

235

6.2.2 At any time prior to, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions, upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, redeem all or a part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of, and accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, subject to the rights of
holders of the Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest

the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

6.2.6 Any redemption or notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, provided that no notice of redemption shall be revocable after two
Business Days prior to the date specified for redemption in any such notice of redemption.

**6.3. Redemption for Taxation or Other Reasons**

If at any time the Issuer satisfies the Note Trustee that:

6.3.1 by reason of a change in law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which change
becomes effective on or after the Issue Date, the Issuer would, on the next Interest Payment Date,
become obliged to deduct or withhold from any payment of interest, premium or principal in
respect of the Notes (other than in respect of default interest), any amount for or on account of any
present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed,
levied, collected, withheld or assessed by the UK or any political subdivision thereof, or any other
authority thereof or any change in the application or official interpretation of such laws or
regulations (Taxes);

6.3.2 the Issuer or any Paying Agent would be required to deduct or withhold any amount from any
payment in respect of any Notes pursuant to FATCA;

6.3.3 the Intercompany Borrower would on the next Interest Payment Date be required to make any
withholding or deduction for or on account of any Taxes from payments under the Intercompany
Loan Agreement in respect of any Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes; or

6.3.4 by reason of a change of law (or the application or official interpretation thereof), which change
becomes effective on or after the Issue Date, it has or will become unlawful for the Issuer to
perform any of its obligations under the Intercompany Loan Agreement in respect of any
Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes or to fund or to maintain its participation in any
Intercompany Loan corresponding to the Notes,

then the Issuer may, in order to prevent the relevant deduction, withholding or illegality but is not obliged
to, use its reasonable endeavours to arrange the substitution of a company incorporated under the laws of
another jurisdiction approved by the Note Trustee as principal debtor under the Notes and as lender under
the Intercompany Loan Agreement upon satisfying the conditions for substitution of the Issuer as set out
in Condition 13 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver and Substitution). The Issuer may, upon
giving not more than 15 nor less than five Business Days’ notice to the Note Trustee and the Noteholders
in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices), redeem all (but not some only) of the Notes at any time at their
Outstanding Principal Amount plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. Before giving any such notice of

236


-----

redemption, the Issuer shall provide to the Note Trustee a certificate signed by an authorised signatory of
the Issuer (a) stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of
facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer so to redeem have been satisfied
(together with evidence satisfactory to the Note Trustee that such conditions have been satisfied, including
such legal opinions as the Note Trustee may require) and (b) confirming that the Issuer will have sufficient
funds on such Interest Payment Date to effect such redemption and to discharge any amounts to be paid in
priority to, or _pari passu with, the Notes being redeemed._

**6.4. Change of Control**

6.4.1 If at any time there occurs a Change of Control, a Change of Control Event shall be deemed to have
occurred. Within 30 days following a Change of Control Event, the Issuer shall give notice to the
Noteholders of the occurrence of such Change of Control Event (such notice, a Change of Control
**Event Notice), any such notice to be delivered in accordance with the provisions of Condition 15**
(Notices). The Issuer shall specify in the Change of Control Event Notice the date on which the
tendered Notes will be repurchased (the Change of Control Payment Date), which date will be no
earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such Change of Control Event Notice is
mailed or delivered. Upon the Issuer receiving at least five Business Days’ notice from any
Noteholder (any such notice, a Put Event Notice), the Notes of such Noteholder as specified in the
Put Event Notice shall become due and repayable on the Change of Control Payment Date and the
Issuer will redeem each Note which is the subject of such Put Event Notice on the Change of
Control Payment Date at 101% of its principal amount together with interest accrued to (but
excluding) the Change of Control Payment Date (the Change of Control Payment).

6.4.2 The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the
Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of
Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of this Condition 6.4 and the related provisions of the
Agency Agreement, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and
shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this Condition 6.4 and the related
provisions of the Agency Agreement by virtue of compliance with such securities laws or
regulations.

6.4.3 Pursuant to the above provisions, any Noteholder having the right to require early redemption of
any Notes held by it pursuant to this Condition 6.4, to exercise the right to require redemption of
such Notes such Noteholder must, if such Note is in definitive form and held outside Euroclear,
Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, deliver, at the specified office of any Paying Agent at
any time during normal business hours of such Paying Agent prior to the Change of Control
Payment Date, a duly completed and signed notice of exercise in the form (for the time being
current) obtainable from any specified office of any Paying Agent (a **Put Exercise Notice) and in**
which the Noteholder must specify a bank account (or, if payment is required to be made by
cheque, an address) to which payment is to be made under this Condition 6.4 accompanied by such
Note or evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent concerned that such Note will, following delivery
of the Put Exercise Notice, be held to its order or under its control. If such Note is represented by a
Global Note or is in definitive form and held through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, to
exercise the right to require redemption of such Notes the holder of such Note must, prior to the
Change of Control Payment Date, give notice to the Paying Agent of such exercise in accordance
with the standard procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, (which
may include notice being given on instruction of the relevant Noteholder by Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, or any common service provider for them to the
Paying Agent by electronic means) in a form acceptable to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg,
as the case may be, from time to time and, if such Note is represented by a Global Note, at the same
time present or procure the presentation of the relevant Global Note to the Paying Agent for
notation accordingly.

6.4.4 Any Put Exercise Notice or other notice given by a holder of any Note in accordance with the
standard procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, pursuant to this
Condition 6.4 shall be irrevocable except where, prior to the due date of redemption, an Event of
Default has occurred and the Note Trustee has declared the Notes to be due and repayable
pursuant to Condition 9 (Events of Default), in which event such holder, at its option, may elect by
notice to the Issuer to withdraw the notice given pursuant to this Condition 6.4.

237


-----

6.4.5 The Issuer will not be required to give a Change of Control Event Notice in connection with a
Change of Control if (1) a third party gives a Change of Control Event Notice in the manner, at the
times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in these Conditions applicable to
a Change of Control Event Notice given by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to a Put Event Notice, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given
pursuant to Condition 6.2, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable
redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Condition 6.4, a
Change of Control Event Notice may be given in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon
the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of
Control at the time the Change of Control Event Notice is given.

6.4.6 If Noteholders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes pursuant to a Put Event Notice and the Issuer, or any third
party giving a Change of Control Event Notice in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all
of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Noteholders, the Issuer or such third party
will have the right, upon not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that
such notice is given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of
Control Event Notice described above) to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such
purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to
the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, on the Notes to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

**6.5. Selection and Notice**

6.5.1 In the case of a partial redemption, the Notes shall be selected for redemption either (a) in
accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing systems; or (b) if the relevant clearing
systems prescribe no method of selection or the Notes are not held in a clearing system, the Notes
shall be redeemed on a pro rata basis according to the holding of each Noteholder; subject, in each
case, to compliance with any applicable laws and stock exchange or other relevant regulatory
requirements. None of the applicable Paying Agent, the Note Trustee nor the Registrar will be
liable for any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

6.5.2 No notes of £100,000 in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part; provided that the Notes
in excess of £100,000 may be redeemed in part in integral multiples of £1,000.

6.5.3 If any series of Notes is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
series of Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case
of a Note in definitive form, a new Definitive Note in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed
portion of any Definitive Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Noteholder
thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Note. In the case of a Note represented by a
Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. If such redemption is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent,
the related notice may, for the avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the
redemption date may be automatically delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be
satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date of redemption be delayed to a date
later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent), or such redemption may not occur
and such notice may be rescinded if any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied or
waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

**7.** **PAYMENTS**

**7.1. Payments of principal and interest**

7.1.1 Payments of principal and premium, if any, in respect of Notes will be made to the holder (or the
first named of joint holders) of such Note against presentation and surrender of the relevant Note
at the specified office of the Registrar.

7.1.2 Interest on Notes payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the holder (or the first
named of joint holders) (i) in respect of a Global Note, at the close of the business day (being for
this purpose a day on which Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg are open for business) before
the relevant due date and (ii) in respect of a Note in definitive form, on the 15th day before the due
date for payment thereof (the Record Date). Payment of interest on each Note will be made in the
currency in which such payment is due by cheque drawn on a bank in the principal financial centre
of the country of the currency concerned and mailed to the holder (or to the first named of joint
holders) of such Note at its address appearing in the register. Upon application by the Noteholder
to the specified office of the Registrar before the relevant Record Date, such payment of interest
may be made by transfer to an account in the relevant currency maintained by the payee with a bank
in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency.

7.1.3 On the occasion of each payment a record of each payment so made will be endorsed on the
schedule to the Global Note or the Note in definitive form by or on behalf of the Principal Paying
Agent or the Registrar, as the case may be, which endorsement shall be prima facie evidence that
such payment has been made.

7.1.4 Holders of Notes will not be entitled to any interest or other payment for any delay in receiving any
amount due in respect of any Note as a result of a cheque posted in accordance with this
Condition 7 arriving after the due date for payment or being lost in the post. No commissions or
expenses shall be charged to such holders by the Registrar in respect of any payments of principal or
interest in respect of the Notes.

7.1.5 None of the Issuer, the Note Trustee or the agents will have any responsibility or liability for any
aspect of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in
the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial
ownership interests.

**7.2. General Provisions Applicable To Payments**

The holder of a Global Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments in respect of Notes
represented by such Global Note and the Issuer will be discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the
holder of such Global Note in respect of each amount so paid. Each of the persons shown in the records of
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the beneficial holder of a particular nominal amount of Notes
represented by such Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case
may be, for his share of each payment so made by the Issuer to, or to the order of, the holder of such
Global Note.

239


-----

**7.3. Payment Day**

If the date for payment of any amount in respect of any Note is not a Payment Day, the holder thereof
shall not be entitled to payment until the next following Payment Day in the relevant place and shall not be
entitled to further interest or other payment in respect of such delay. For these purposes, **Payment Day**
means any day which (subject to Condition 11 (Prescription)) is:

7.3.1 (in the case of Notes in definitive form only) a day on which commercial banks and foreign
exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign
exchange and foreign currency deposits) in the relevant place of presentation; and

7.3.2 in relation to any sum payable in respect of the Notes, a day on which commercial banks and foreign
exchange markets settle payments and are open for general business (including dealing in foreign
exchange and foreign currency deposits) in London.

**7.4. Payments subject to fiscal laws; payments on Global Notes**

7.4.1 All payments are subject in all cases to any applicable fiscal or other laws, regulations and
directives, but without prejudice to the provisions of this Condition 7. No commission or expenses
shall be charged to the Noteholders in respect of such payments.

7.4.2 The holder of a Global Note shall be the only person entitled to receive payments of principal,
premium, if any, and interest on the Global Note (as the case may be) and the Issuer will be
discharged by payment to, or to the order of, the holder of such Global Note in respect of each
amount paid.

**7.5. Appointment of the Agents**

7.5.1 The agents appointed by the Issuer (and their respective specified offices) are listed in the Agency
Agreement. The agents act solely as agents of the Issuer (and, in the circumstances as set out in the
Agency Agreement, the Note Trustee) and do not assume any obligation or relationship of agency
or trust for or with any Noteholder. The Issuer reserves the right, with the prior written consent of
the Note Trustee, at any time to vary or terminate the appointment of any Agent, and to appoint
additional or other agents, provided that the Issuer will at all times maintain:

(1) a Principal Paying Agent;

(2) a Registrar which, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market, shall have
offices in Luxembourg;

(3) an Agent Bank;

(4) a transfer agent in Luxembourg (the Transfer Agent); and

(5) one or more paying agents (each, a Paying Agent), including: (a) a paying agent in the City of
London (which may be the Principal Paying Agent); and (b) for so long as the Notes are
listed on the Euro MTF market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the **Euro MTF**
**Market), a paying agent in Luxembourg (the Luxembourg Paying Agent). Notice of any such**
variation, termination, resignation or appointment shall be given promptly to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices).

7.5.2 The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg. The initial Transfer
Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. in Luxembourg.

7.5.3 The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the Notes outstanding from time to
time and will facilitate transfer of the Notes on the behalf of the Issuer.

7.5.4 The Issuer may change any Paying Agents, the Registrar or the Transfer Agent without prior notice
to the holders of Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF Market and the rules
of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of
Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent in a newspaper having a general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner
permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
(www.bourse.lu).

**8.** **TAXATION**

8.1. All payments in respect of the Notes will be made (whether by the Issuer, either Guarantor, any
Paying Agent or the Note Trustee) free and clear of, and without withholding or deduction for, or
on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or charges of whatsoever nature
unless the Issuer, either Guarantor, any Paying Agent or the Note Trustee, as the case may be, is
required by applicable law to make any payment in respect of the Notes, subject to any withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or charges of
whatsoever nature. In that event, the Issuer, such Guarantor, such Paying Agent or the Note
Trustee, as the case may be, shall make such payment after such withholding or deduction has been
made and shall account to the relevant authorities for the amount so required to be withheld or
deducted, but without limitation to Condition 6.3 (Redemption for Taxation or Other Reasons). The
Issuer, the Guarantors, any Paying Agent, the Registrar or the Note Trustee may require holders to
provide such certifications and other documents as required by applicable law in order to qualify for
exemptions from applicable tax laws.

8.2. The Issuer or, as the case may be, the Guarantors will pay such additional amounts in respect of any
taxes imposed by the Tax Jurisdiction as shall be necessary in order that the net amounts received by
the holders of the Notes after such withholding or deduction shall equal the respective amounts of
principal and premium (if applicable) and interest which would otherwise have been receivable in
respect of the Notes in the absence of such withholding or deduction in respect of such taxes, except
that no such additional amounts shall be payable with respect to any Note:

8.2.1 the holder of which is liable for such taxes or duties in respect of such Note by reason of his having
some connection with a Tax Jurisdiction other than the mere holding of such Note; or

8.2.2 presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date (as defined below) except to the
extent that the holder thereof would have been entitled to an additional amount on presenting the
same for payment on such thirtieth day assuming that day to have been a Payment Day (as defined
in Condition 7.3 (Payment Day)).

As used herein:

(1) Tax Jurisdiction means the United Kingdom or any political subdivision or any authority thereof or
therein having power to tax; and

(2) the Relevant Date means the date on which such payment first becomes due, except that, if the full
amount of the moneys payable has not been duly received by the Note Trustee or the relevant
Paying Agent on or prior to such due date, it means the date on which, the full amount of such
moneys having been so received, notice to that effect is duly given to the Noteholders in accordance
with Condition 15 (Notices).

8.3. For the avoidance of doubt, payments will be subject in all cases, to any withholding or deduction
required pursuant to an agreement described in Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code
of 1986 (the Code) or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (or
any regulations thereunder or official interpretations thereof) or an intergovernmental agreement
between the United States and another jurisdiction facilitating the implementation thereof (or any
law implementing such an intergovernmental agreement). Any such amounts withheld or deducted
will be treated as paid for all purposes under the Notes, and no additional amounts will be paid on
the Notes with respect to any such withholding or deduction.

**13. MEETINGS OF NOTEHOLDERS, MODIFICATION, WAIVER AND SUBSTITUTION**

**13.1. Meetings of Noteholders, Modifications and Waiver**

of the Notes, to consider matters affecting their interests, including the modification of these
Conditions, the Note Trust Deed and any other Transaction Document and any other document to
which the Note Trustee is a party or in relation to which the Security Trustee holds security. Subject
to Condition 13.2 (Modification and waiver) and Condition 4.9.2, any modification may be made if
sanctioned by a resolution passed at a meeting or meetings of the Noteholders of the relevant class
or classes duly convened and held in accordance with the Note Trust Deed by a majority of not less
than three-quarters of the votes cast (an **Extraordinary Resolution) of such Noteholders. Such a**
meeting may be convened by the Note Trustee or the Issuer and shall be convened by the Issuer
upon the request in writing of the Noteholders holding not less than one-tenth of the aggregate
Outstanding Principal Amount of the outstanding Notes of the relevant class.

13.1.2 The quorum at any meeting convened to vote on an Extraordinary Resolution will be one or more
persons holding or representing not less than 50% of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount
of the relevant outstanding Notes or, at any adjourned meeting, one or more persons being or
representing Noteholders, whatever the Outstanding Principal Amount of the relevant outstanding
Notes held or represented, provided, however, that certain proposals (the **Basic Terms**
**Modifications) in respect of any particular class of Notes, being any proposal:**

(1) to change any date fixed for payment of principal or interest in respect of such Notes, to
change the amount of principal or the rate of interest payable on any date in respect of such
class of Notes or (other than as specified in Conditions 6 (Redemption, Purchase and
_Cancellation) and 7 (Payments)) to alter the method of calculating the amount of any_
payment in respect of such Notes on redemption or maturity;

(2) other than pursuant to Condition 13.2 (Modification and waiver), to effect the exchange,
conversion or substitution of such Notes for, or their conversion into shares, Notes or other
obligations or securities of the Issuer or any other person or body corporate formed or to be
formed and/or for cash;

(3) to change the currency in which amounts due in respect of such Notes are payable;

(4) to change the quorum required at any meeting or the majority required to pass an
Extraordinary Resolution;

(5) the sanctioning of any such scheme or proposal or substitution as is described in
paragraphs 20(i) and 20(j) of Schedule 5 of the Note Trust Deed;

(6) to change (a) the requirements to redistribute any recoveries made other than in accordance
with the priority of payments; (b) the priority of payments and/or the subordination

244


-----

arrangements; or (c) the right to give instructions to the Security Trustee and subject to the
provisions concerning meetings of particular combinations of classes of Notes as set out in
this Condition 13 and the Note Trust Deed; or

(7) to amend this definition or this Condition 13,

may be sanctioned only by an Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of holders of such class
of Notes at which one or more persons holding or representing not less than three-quarters or, at
any adjourned meeting, one quarter of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the relevant
outstanding Notes form a quorum. Any resolution duly passed at any such meeting shall be binding
on all the relevant Noteholders whether present or not.

13.1.3 In addition, a resolution in writing signed, or an approval given by way of electronic consents
communicated through the electronic communications systems of the relevant clearing system(s), in
each case, by or on behalf of the holders of not less than 75% or (in the case of any Basic Terms
Modification) 90% of the aggregate Outstanding Principal Amount of the relevant class or classes
of Notes will take effect as if it were an Extraordinary Resolution. Such a resolution in writing may
be contained in one document or several documents in the same form, each signed by or on behalf
of one or more relevant Noteholders.

13.1.4 A meeting of such Noteholders will also have the power (exercisable by Extraordinary Resolution)
to advise or instruct the Note Trustee (including to instruct the Note Trustee to instruct the Security
Trustee) in connection with the exercise by the Note Trustee and/or the Security Trustee (at the
direction of the Note Trustee), as the case may be, of any of their rights, powers and discretions
under the Note Trust Deed, the Security Agreement or the other Transaction Documents including
to appoint any persons (whether Noteholders or not) as a committee to represent the interests of
such Noteholders and to confer upon such committee any powers which such Noteholders could
themselves exercise by Extraordinary Resolution.

13.1.5 For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of articles 86 to 94-8 of the Luxembourg Act dated
10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended, shall not apply in respect of the Notes.

**13.2. Modification and waiver**

13.2.1 The Note Trustee may (subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and subject to Condition 4.9 (Amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement
_and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)), without the consent of the Noteholders or (subject as_
provided below) any other Secured Creditor, concur with, or direct the Security Trustee to concur
with, the Issuer, any Guarantor or any other relevant parties in making (i) any modification to these
Conditions, Notes, the Note Trust Deed, the Security Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents or other document to which the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee is a party or, in
respect of which the Security Trustee holds security, if in the opinion of the Note Trustee such
modification is made to correct a manifest error or is of a formal, minor or technical nature or
(ii) any modification (other than a Basic Terms Modification) to these Conditions, Notes, the Note
Trust Deed, the Security Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (subject as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or other document to which
the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee is a party or in respect of which the Security Trustee holds
security, if the Note Trustee is of the opinion that such modification is not materially prejudicial to
the interests of the Noteholders then outstanding, provided that any modification that has the effect
of changing or which relates to (i) the requirements to redistribute any recoveries made other than
in accordance with the priority of payments; (ii) the priority of payments and/or the subordination
arrangements; or (iii) the right to give instructions to the Security Trustee shall not be made without
the consent of the Noteholders (in accordance with these Conditions), the Facility Providers and the
Security Trustee. The Note Trustee and the Security Trustee are authorised to execute and deliver
on behalf of each Secured Creditor other than the affected Secured Creditors all documentation
required to implement such modification and such execution by the Note Trustee and/or the
Security Trustee, as the case may be, shall bind each of the Noteholders and such Secured Creditors
as if (in the case of such Secured Creditors) such documentation had been duly executed by it.

13.2.2 The Note Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or (subject as provided below) any
other Secured Creditor and without prejudice to its rights in respect of any subsequent breach or
Event of Default, from time to time, and at any time but only if and in so far as in its opinion the

245


-----

interests of the Noteholders then outstanding shall not be materially prejudiced thereby, (subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) waive or
authorise, or direct the Security Trustee to waive or authorise, any breach or proposed breach by the
Issuer, any Guarantor or any other relevant party of any of the covenants or provisions contained in
these Conditions or the Note Trust Deed or the other Transaction Documents or other document to
which the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee is a party or in respect of which the Security Trustee
holds security, or determine that any event which would otherwise constitute an Event of Default
shall not be treated as such for the purposes of the Note Trust Deed, provided that, to the extent
such event, matter or thing relates to a matter or thing that has the effect of changing or which
relates to (i) the requirements to redistribute any recoveries made other than in accordance with
the priority of payments; (ii) the priority of payments and/or the subordination arrangements; or
(iii) the right to give instructions to the Security Trustee, shall not be made without the consent of
the Noteholders (in accordance with these Conditions), the Facility Providers and the Security
Trustee and provided further that the Note Trustee shall not exercise such powers in contravention
of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, of any express direction
given by Extraordinary Resolution of the holders of the Notes then outstanding or of a request in
writing made by holders of not less than one-quarter in aggregate of the principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (but no such direction or request shall affect any waiver, authorisation or
determination previously given or made) or so as to authorise or waive any proposed breach or
breach relating to any matter which is the subject of a Basic Terms Modification.

13.2.3 Any such modification, waiver, authorisation or determination may be given or made on such terms
and subject to such conditions (if any) as the Note Trustee may determine, shall be binding on the
Noteholders and the other Secured Creditors and, unless the Note Trustee agrees otherwise, notice
thereof shall be given by the Issuer to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 15 (Notices) as
soon as practicable thereafter.

13.2.4 Notwithstanding that none of the Note Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Noteholders or the other
Secured Creditors has any right of recourse against the Rating Agencies in respect of any
confirmation from the Rating Agencies which is relied upon by the Note Trustee or the Security
Trustee, as the case may be, and the Note Trustee and the Security Trustee shall be entitled to
assume, for the purposes of exercising any power, trust, authority, duty or discretion under or in
relation to the Notes, the Note Trust Deed, any other Transaction Documents or any other
document to which the Note Trustee or the Security Trustee is a party or in respect of which the
Security Trustee holds security, that such exercise will not be materially prejudicial to the interests
of the Noteholders if the Rating Agencies have provided confirmation that such exercise will not
have an adverse effect on the then ratings of the Notes. Without prejudice to the foregoing, the
Noteholders are deemed to agree for the benefit of the Rating Agencies only that a credit rating is,
however, an assessment of credit and does not address other matters that may be of relevance to
Noteholders. The Note Trustee, the Security Trustee and the Noteholders agree and acknowledge
that being entitled to rely on the fact that the Rating Agencies have delivered confirmation that the

and/or secured and/or pre-funded to its satisfaction.

14.1.2 In connection with the exercise by the Note Trustee under these Conditions, the Note Trust Deed
or the other Transaction Documents of its rights, powers, trusts, authorities and discretions
(including any modification, consent, waiver or authorisation), the Note Trustee shall where it is

interests of the holders of the Notes as a class and will not have regard to the consequences of such
exercise for individual Noteholders resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or
resident in, or otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory
and the Note Trustee shall not be entitled to require from the Issuer, nor shall any Noteholders be
entitled to claim from the Issuer or the Note Trustee, any indemnification or other payment in
respect of any consequence (including any tax consequence) for individual Noteholders of any
such exercise.

**14.2. Reliance on certificates**

The Note Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on a certificate or report of any director of the Issuer

manner which complies with the rules and regulations of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and any
other listing authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system on which the Notes are for the time
being listed. Any such notice (other than to holders of Notes as specified above) shall be deemed
to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once or on different
dates, on the first date on which publication is made.

15.1.2 For Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid

be Luxemburger Wort) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, posted on the

by the creation and issue of further notes (Further Notes) carrying the same terms and conditions in all
respects (or in all respects except for the first Interest Period) as, and so that the same shall be
consolidated and form a single series and rank pari passu with, any class of the Notes provided that:

16.1.1 the aggregate principal amount of all Further Notes to be issued on such date is not less than
£5,000,000;

16.1.2 any Further Notes are assigned the same ratings as are then applicable to the class of Notes with
which they are to be consolidated and form a single series;

16.1.3 the ratings of each class of Notes at that time outstanding are not downgraded, withdrawn or
qualified as a result of such issue of Further Notes and none of such ratings is lower than it was
upon the date of issue of any of the Notes;

16.1.4 an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such Further Notes will be on-lent by the
Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Intercompany Loan Agreement; and

16.1.5 application will be made, in respect of the Further Notes, for such notes to be admitted to trading
on the Euro MTF Market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and listed on the official list of the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or, if the Notes then issued are no longer admitted to trading on that
exchange, such exchange, if any, on which the Notes then issued are then admitted to trading on.

**16.2. Supplemental trust deeds and security**

Any such Further Notes will be constituted by a further deed or deeds supplemental to the Note Trust
Deed and have the benefit of the security constituted by the Security Agreement. Any of the Transaction
Documents may be amended as provided in Condition 13 (Meetings of Noteholders, Modification, Waiver
_and Substitution) or otherwise, and further Transaction Documents may be entered into, in connection with_
the issue of such Further Notes and the claims of any of the parties to any amended Transaction Document
or any further Transaction Document may rank ahead of, pari passu with, or behind, any class or classes of
the Notes, provided, in each case, that the condition set out in Condition 16.1.3 is satisfied, _mutatis_

The Issuer irrevocably agrees, for the benefit of the Note Trustee and the Noteholders that the courts of

No person shall have any right to enforce any term or condition of the Notes or the Note Trust Deed under

Under the Note Trust Deed, persons shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg

Note became void, they had been the registered holders of Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of Notes they were shown as holding in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg (as the case may be).

**17.5. Clearing System Accountholders**

References in these Conditions of the Notes to **Noteholder are references to the person shown in the**
register as the holder of the Global Note.

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may
be, as being entitled to an interest in a Global Note (each an Accountholder) must look solely to Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) for such Accountholder’s share of each payment
made by the Issuer to such Accountholder and in relation to all other rights arising under the Global Note.
The extent to which, and the manner in which, Accountholders may exercise any rights arising under a
Global Note will be determined by the respective rules and procedures of any relevant Clearing System (as
the case may be) from time to time. For so long as the relevant Notes are represented by a Global Note,
Accountholders shall have no claim directly against the Issuer or in respect of payments due under the
Notes and such obligations of the Issuer will be discharged by payment to the registered holder of the
Global Note.

**FORMS OF THE NOTES**

Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be
represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the Global Note). The
Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the name of
the nominee of the common depository for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Persons holding beneficial interests in the Global Note will be entitled or required, as the case may be,
under the circumstances described below, to receive physical delivery of Definitive Notes in fully registered
form.

Payments of principal, interest and any other amount in respect of the Global Note will, in the absence of
provision to the contrary, be made to the person shown on the register as the registered holder of the
Global Notes. None of the Issuer, any Paying Agent, the Note Trustee or the Registrar will have any
responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments or deliveries made on
account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing
any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Payments of principal, interest or any other amount in respect of the Notes in definitive form will, in the
absence of provision to the contrary, be made to the persons shown on the register on the relevant Record
Date immediately preceding the due date for payment in the manner provided in Condition 7 (Payments).

Interests in a Global Note will be exchangeable (free of charge), in whole but not in part, for Definitive
Notes only upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event. For these purposes, **Exchange Event means that**
(i) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the Issuer has been notified that both Euroclear
and Clearstream, Luxembourg have been closed for business for a continuous period of 14 days (other
than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or have announced an intention permanently to cease
business or have in fact done so and, in any such case, no successor Clearing System satisfactory to the
Note Trustee is available. The Issuer will promptly give notice to Noteholders in accordance with
_Condition 15 (Notices) if an Exchange Event occurs. In the event of the occurrence of an Exchange Event,_
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any person acting on their behalf (acting on the instructions
of any holder of an interest in such Global Note) may give notice to the Registrar requesting exchange.
Any such exchange shall occur not later than ten days after the date of receipt of the notice by the
Registrar.

**_Transfer of Interests_**

Interests in a Global Note may, subject to compliance with all applicable restrictions, be transferred to a
person who wishes to hold such interest in another Global Note. No beneficial owner of an interest in a
Global Note will be able to transfer such interest, except in accordance with the applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, in each case to the extent applicable. The Notes are also subject
**to the restrictions on transfer set forth therein and will bear a legend regarding such restrictions (see ‘‘Plan**
**_of Distribution’’)._**

**_General_**

Any reference herein to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg shall, whenever the context so
permits, be deemed to include a reference to any additional or alternative Clearing System may otherwise
be approved by the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent and the Note Trustee.

No Noteholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the Note Trustee or the
Security Trustee, as the case may be, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable
period and the failure shall be continuing.

The Issuer may agree with any Joint Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner that Notes may be issued
in a form not contemplated by the Terms and Conditions of the Notes herein, in which event a new offering
memorandum or a supplement to this Offering Memorandum, if appropriate, will be made available which
will describe the effect of the agreement reached in relation to such Notes.

**_Provisions Relating to the Notes while in Global Form_**

Global Notes will contain provisions that apply to the Notes which they represent, some of which modify
the effect of the Conditions of the Notes as set out in this Offering Memorandum. The following is a
summary of certain of those provisions:

- _Meetings: The holder of a Global Note shall be treated as being two persons for the purposes of any_
quorum requirements of a meeting of Noteholders and, at any such meeting, the holder of a Global
Note shall be treated as having one vote in respect of each minimum denomination of Notes for which
such Global Note may be exchanged.

- _Cancellation: Cancellation of any Note represented by a Global Note that is required by the_
Conditions to be cancelled (other than upon its redemption) will be effected by reduction in the
principal amount of the relevant Global Note.

- _Notices: So long as any Notes are represented by a Global Note and such Global Note is held on_
behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant Clearing System, notices to the
Noteholders may be given, subject always to listing requirements, by delivery of the relevant notice to
Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other relevant Clearing System for communication by it
to entitled Accountholders in substitution for publication as provided in the Conditions. Such notices
shall be deemed to have been received by the Noteholders on the date of delivery to such Clearing
Systems.

**BOOK-ENTRY CLEARANCE PROCEDURE**

_The information set out below is subject to any change in or reinterpretation of the rules, regulations and_
_procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (together, the_ **Clearing Systems) currently in effect.**
_Investors wishing to use the facilities of any of the Clearing Systems are advised to confirm the continued_
_applicability of the rules, regulations and procedures of the relevant Clearing System. None of the Issuer, the_
_Note Trustee nor any other party to the Agency Agreement will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect_
_of the records relating to, or payments made on account of, beneficial ownership interests in the Notes held_
_through the facilities of any Clearing System or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to_
_such beneficial ownership interests._

**Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg**

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each holds securities for its customers and facilitates the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions by electronic book-entry transfer between their
respective account holders. Custodial and depositary links have been established between Euroclear and
Clearstream, Luxembourg to facilitate the issue of the Notes and cross-market transfers of the Notes
associated with secondary market trading. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each holds securities
for its customers and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions through electronic
book-entry transfer between their respective accountholders. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
provide various services including safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally
traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg also deal
with domestic securities markets in several countries through established depositary and custodial
relationships. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg have established an electronic bridge between their
two systems across which their respective participants may settle trades with each other.

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg customers are world-wide financial institutions, including
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Indirect
access to Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg is available to other institutions which clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with an accountholder of either system. Investors may hold their interests
in Global Notes directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as direct participants or indirectly
as indirect participants.

**Book-entry ownership**

Each Global Note will have an ISIN and a common code and will be deposited with, or on behalf of, a
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for Euroclear
and Clearstream.

**Payments and relationship of participants with Clearing Systems**

Each of the persons shown in the records of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a
Note represented by a Global Note must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case
may be) for his share of each payment made by the Issuer to the holder of such Global Note and in relation
to all other rights arising under the Global Note, subject to and in accordance with the respective rules and
procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg. The Issuer expects that, upon receipt of any
payment in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note, the common depositary, by whom such Note is
held, or nominee in whose name it is registered, will immediately credit the relevant participants’ or
accountholders’ accounts in the relevant Clearing System with payments in amounts proportionate to their
respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note as shown on the records
of the relevant Clearing System or its nominee. The Issuer also expects that payments by direct participants
in any Clearing System to owners of beneficial interests in any Global Note held through such direct
participants in any Clearing System will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices. Save
as aforesaid, such persons shall have no claim directly against the Issuer in respect of payments due on the
Notes for so long as the Notes are represented by such Global Note and the obligations of the Issuer will
be discharged by payment to the registered holder, as the case may be, of such Global Note in respect of
each amount so paid.

**Settlement and transfer of Notes**

Transfers of any interests in Notes represented by a Global Note within Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg will be effected in accordance with the customary rules and operating procedures of the

311


-----

relevant Clearing System. The laws in some States within the United States require that certain persons
take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer Notes
represented by a Global Note to such persons may depend upon the ability to exchange such Notes for
Notes in definitive form.

Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear have each published rules and operating procedures designed to
facilitate transfers of beneficial interests in Global Notes among participants and accountholders of
Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear. However, they are under no obligation to perform or continue
to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or changed at any time. None of
the Issuer, the Note Trustee, the agents or any Joint Global Coordinator and Joint Bookrunner will be
responsible for any performance by Clearstream, Luxembourg or Euroclear or their respective direct or
indirect participants or accountholders of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations and none of them will have any liability for any aspect of the records relating to
or payments made on account of beneficial interests in the Notes represented by Global Notes or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial interests.

**Customs (HMRC) relating only to United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments of interest on**
**the Notes. The following is not exhaustive and does not deal with any other United Kingdom taxation**
**implications of acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. The United Kingdom tax treatment of prospective**
**Noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.**
**Prospective Noteholders who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom or who**
**may be unsure as to their tax position should seek their own professional advice. References in this part to**
**‘‘interest’’ shall mean amounts that are treated as interest for the purposes of United Kingdom taxation.**

**_Payment of Interest on the Notes_**

_Payment of Interest by the Issuer_

Payments of interest on the Notes by the Issuer may be made without deduction of or withholding on
account of United Kingdom income tax provided that the Notes continue to be listed on a ‘‘recognised
stock exchange’’ within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The Luxembourg Stock
Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will be treated as listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange if they are both admitted to trading on the Euro MTF of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange and are officially listed in Luxembourg in accordance with provisions corresponding to
those generally applicable in countries in the European Economic Area. Provided, therefore, that the
Notes carry a right to interest and that the Notes remain so listed on a ‘‘recognised stock exchange’’,
interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction on account of United Kingdom
income tax.

Payments of interest on the Notes by the Issuer may also be paidwithout withholding or deduction on
account of United Kingdom tax where interest on the Notes is paid by a company and, at the time the
payment is made, the Issuer reasonably believes (and any person by or through whom interest on the Notes
is paid reasonably believes) that the beneficial owner is within the charge to United Kingdom corporation
tax as regards the payment of interest provided that HMRC has not given a direction (in circumstances
where it has reasonable grounds to believe that the above exemption is not available in respect of such
payment of interest at the time the payment is made) that the interest should be paid under deduction of
tax.

In other cases, an amount must generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes that has a
United Kingdom source on account of United Kingdom income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%)
subject to any other available exemptions or reliefs. However, where an applicable double tax treaty
provides for a lower rate of withholding tax (or for no tax to be withheld) in relation to a Noteholder,
HMRC can issue a notice to the Issuer to pay interest to the Noteholder without deduction of tax (or for
interest to be paid with tax deducted at the rate provided for in the relevant double tax treaty).

_Payments in respect of the Guarantees_

The United Kingdom withholding tax treatment of payments by the Guarantor under the terms of the
Guarantee which have a United Kingdom source is uncertain. In particular, such payments by the
Guarantor may not be eligible for the exemptions described above in relation to payments of interest.
Accordingly, if the Guarantor makes any such payments, these may be subject to United Kingdom
withholding tax at the basic rate.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax_**

On 14 February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the Commission’s Proposal) for a
Directive for a common Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain,
France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the participating Member States). However,
Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions
referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 are expected to be exempt.

321


-----

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within
and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes
where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating
Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, ‘‘established’’ in a participating Member
State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a
participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued
in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU
Member States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Merrill Lynch International and HSBC Bank plc are acting as representatives of each of the initial
purchasers named below. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a subscription agreement among
the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners (in such capacity, the
Joint Global Coordinators and the Joint Bookrunners together, the Initial Purchasers) (the Subscription
**Agreement), the Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and each of the Initial Purchasers have**
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuer, the principal amount of the Notes set forth
opposite its name below.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Subscription Agreement, the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase all of the Notes sold under the Subscription Agreement if any
of these Notes are purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, the Subscription Agreement provides that
the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Subscription
Agreement may be terminated.

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in
respect of those liabilities.

**Commissions and Discounts**

The representatives have advised the Issuer that the Initial Purchasers propose initially to offer the Notes
at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial offering,
the offering price or any other term of the offering may be changed. The Initial Purchasers may offer and
sell Notes through certain of their affiliates.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws. The Initial
Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the
Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Regulation S. The Initial
Purchasers will not offer or sell the Notes except pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that
occur outside of the United States within the meaning of Regulation S. In addition, until 40 days following
the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of notes within the United States by a dealer (whether
or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Each
purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations and agreements as
described under ‘‘Notice to Investors’’.

**New Issue of Notes**

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. The Issuer does not intend
to list the Notes on any securities exchange or on any automated dealer quotation system, except that
application has been made, through the listing agent, for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof. The
Issuer and the Guarantors cannot assure you that this application will be accepted or that, if accepted, such
listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers may make a market in the Notes after completion of the
offering, but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time
without notice. The Issuer and the Guarantors cannot assure the liquidity of the trading market for the
Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the
Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial

323


-----

offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the Group’s
operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Settlement**

The Issuer expects that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the
date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be eleven business days
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as ‘‘T + 11’’). Trades in
the secondary market generally are required to settle in three to five business days, unless the parties to
any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date
of pricing or the next seven succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes
initially will settle in T+11, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next
seven succeeding business days should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuer has agreed that it will not, for a period of 180 days after the date of this Offering Memorandum,
without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Joint Global Coordinators, directly or indirectly,
issue, sell, offer to contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt
securities or securities exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, having a tenor of more than
one year, except for the Notes sold to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.

**Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open
market. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions
created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a greater principal amount of
Notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The Initial Purchasers must close out any short
position by purchasing Notes in the open market. A short position is more likely to be created if the Initial
Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the Notes in the open
market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short sales
may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price
that might otherwise exist in the open market.

None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction
as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Notes. In addition, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors or any of the Initial Purchasers make any
representation that the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once
commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.

**Other Relationships**

Some of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in,
investment banking and other commercial dealings in the ordinary course of business with the Issuer, the
Guarantors or their respective affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees
and commissions for these transactions. Certain of the Initial Purchasers are holders of the Existing Debt.
In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers are Senior Borrower Loan Providers. Furthermore, certain of
the Initial Purchasers are a counterparty to certain of the Group’s existing interest rate and/or index linked
hedging arrangements, for which they have received customary fees and commissions.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates
routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer, the Guarantors or their respective affiliates consistent
with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would

324


-----

hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default
swaps or the creation of short positions in these securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby.
Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The
Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or
express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or
recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Selling Restrictions**

**_United Kingdom_**

Each Initial Purchaser represents, warrants and agrees that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of
section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or the Guarantors; and

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to any Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

325

(a) it is not a U.S. person and it is located outside the United States (within the meaning of

3. It acknowledges that the Issuer, the Registrar, the relevant Joint Global Coordinator(s) and Joint
Bookrunner(s) and their respective affiliates, and others, will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
above acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of the

Global Note is no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Issuer, the Registrar and the applicable
Joint Global Coordinator(s) and Joint Bookrunner(s). If it is acquiring any Notes as a fiduciary or
agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with
respect to each such account and that it has full power to make the above acknowledgements,
representations and agreements on behalf of each account.

4. It acknowledges that for the period until and including the 40th day after the commencement of the

**ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE SECURITIES ACT) OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY**
**STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER JURISDICTION AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED,**
**SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OR TO U.S.**
**PERSONS (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT) EXCEPT**
**PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE**
**REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.**

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated or organised under the laws of Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No. 1346/2000 on insolvency proceedings (the **EU Insolvency**
**Regulation), which applies to all EU Member States other than Denmark, the court which has jurisdiction**
to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State where the
company concerned has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’.

Preamble 13 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the ‘‘centre of main interests’’ of a debtor should
correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and
‘‘is therefore ascertainable by third parties’’. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held,
the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large
majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place
where the company has its ‘‘centre of main interests’’. There is a rebuttable presumption in Article 3(1) of
the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company’s ‘‘centre of main interests’’ will be its place of the registered
office. However, the interpretation of the phrase ‘‘centre of main interests’’ is a question of fact on which
the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The courts in the jurisdiction where a company is found to have its ‘‘centre of main interests’’ will be
entitled to adjudicate on the specified types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation will be
recognised in the other Member States to which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies. Secondary
proceedings may be opened under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation in another Member State
if the company possesses an establishment within the territory of that other Member State, although the
effect of those proceedings will be restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such
other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court
of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company
under the EU Insolvency Regulation.

**Independent auditors’ report to the members of Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited**

**Report on the group financial statements**

**_Our opinion_**

In our opinion, Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited’s group financial statements (the ‘‘financial statements’’):

- give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s affairs as at 30 June 2016 and of its loss and cash
flows for the year then ended;

- have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘‘IFRSs’’) as adopted by the European Union; and

- have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of
the IAS Regulation.

**_What we have audited_**

The financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements (the
‘‘Annual Report’’), comprise:

- the Consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016;

- the Consolidated income statement and Consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the
year then ended;

- the Consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended;

- the Consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and

- the notes to the financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and
other explanatory information.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the financial statements is
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and applicable law.

In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements,
for example in respect of significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made
assumptions and considered future events.

**_Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006_**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic Report and the Directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

In addition, in light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in
the course of the audit, we are required to report if we have identified any material misstatements in the
Strategic Report and the Directors’ report. We have nothing to report in this respect.

**Other matters on which we are required to report by exception**

**_Adequacy of information and explanations received_**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from
this responsibility.

**_Directors’ remuneration_**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of
directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this
responsibility.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**_Our responsibilities and those of the directors_**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.

Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’’).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the parent company’s members as a
body in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person
to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**_What an audit of financial statements involves_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An audit involves obtaining evidence
about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of:

- whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s circumstances and have been
consistently applied and adequately disclosed;

- the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and

- the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available
evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.

We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider
necessary to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a combination of both.

In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in
the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. With respect to the Strategic Report and
Directors’ report, we consider whether those reports include the disclosures required by applicable legal
requirements.

**Other matter**

We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Arqiva Broadcast Parent
Limited for the year ended 30 June 2016.

**Notes to the Group financial statements**

**1 General information, authorisation of financial statements and Statement of Compliance**

Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited (‘‘the Company’’) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom
(‘‘UK’’) under the Companies Act under registration number 08085823. The address of the registered
office is Crawley Court, Winchester, Hampshire, SO21 2QA.

These consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 30 June
2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘‘Group’’).

The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report on
pages 8 to 38.

**_Statement of Compliance_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) (including International Accounting Standards (‘‘IAS’’) and interpretations
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) and its committees) as adopted for use
in the European Union (‘‘EU’’) and the Companies Act 2006.

As at 30 June 2016, these are the Group’s first annual consolidated financial statements since adopting
IFRS, and the Group has elected 1 July 2013 as the date of transition to IFRS being the commencement of
the earliest comparative period presented (‘‘the Transition Date’’). As at 30 June 2016, these are the
Group’s first annual consolidated financial statements since adopting IFRS, and the Group has elected
1 July 2013 as the date of transition to IFRS being the commencement of the earliest comparative period
presented (‘‘the Transition Date’’). The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (‘UK GAAP’) to IFRS are given in note 35.

The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 _Reduced_
_Disclosure Framework. These are presented on pages 116 to 128._

**2 First time adoption of IFRS, adoption of new and revised Standards**

**_First time adoption of IFRS_**

These financial statements, for the year ended 30 June 2016, are the first the Group has prepared in
accordance with IFRS. Accordingly the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRS
applicable for periods ending on or after 30 June 2016, together with the comparative period data as at and
for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014. In preparing these financial statements, the Group’s
opening statement of financial position was prepared as at 1 July 2013, the Group’s date of transition to
IFRS. Note 35 explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its UK GAAP
financial statements, including the statement of financial position as at 1 July 2013 and the financial
statements as at and for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014.

**_Exemptions applied_**

On first time adoption of IFRS an entity may elect to use exemptions that are allowed by IFRS 1. The
Group has applied the following exemptions:

IFRS 1 First-time adoption

IFRS 1 also required that the UK GAAP carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening IFRS
statement of financial position (apart from adjustments for goodwill impairment and recognition or
de-recognition of intangible assets). In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has tested goodwill for
impairment at the date of transition to IFRS. Under IFRS no goodwill impairment was deemed necessary
at 1 July 2013.

The Group has not applied IAS 21 _The Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates retrospectively to fair value_
adjustments and goodwill from business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.
Such fair value adjustments and goodwill are treated as assets and liabilities of the parent rather than as
assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore, those assets and liabilities are already expressed in the

functional currency of the parent or are non-monetary foreign currency items and no further translation
differences occur.

The UK GAAP carrying amount of property, plant and equipment (based on depreciated historical cost)
has been used in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.

IFRS 3 Business combinations

IFRS 3 _Business combinations has not been applied to acquisitions of subsidiaries, which are considered_
businesses for IFRS, or of interests in associates and joint ventures that occurred before 1 July 2013. Use
of this exemption means that the UK GAAP carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to
be recognised under IFRS, is their deemed cost at the date of acquisition. After the date of the acquisition,
measurement is in accordance with IFRS. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under
IFRS are excluded from the opening IFRS statement of financial position. The Group did not recognise or
exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result of IFRS recognition requirements.

IAS 23 Borrowing costs

The Group has applied the transitional provisions in IAS 23 Borrowing Costs in relation to the
capitalisation of financing costs, and capitalises borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets prospectively
from the date of transition.

IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease

The Group has applied the exemption from retrospectively applying IFRIC 4 _Determining whether an_
_arrangement contains a lease and instead has considered the existence of lease arrangements as at the date_
of transition.

IFRIC 1 _Changes in existing decommissioning, restoration and similar liabilities_

The Group has taken the exemption from full retrospective application of IFRIC 1 _Changes in Existing_
_Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities._

**_Estimates_**

The estimates at 1 July 2013, 30 June 2014 and 30 June 2015 are consistent with those made for the same
dates in accordance with UK GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any differences in accounting policies).

**_New and revised Standards_**

The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year. Their
adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.

_Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures_

The Group has applied the amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures—Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities. The amendments to IFRS 7 require entities to disclose information about rights of offset and
related arrangements (such as collateral posting requirements) for financial instruments under an
enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangement.

As the Group does not have any offsetting arrangements in place, the application of the amendments has
had no impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**2 First time adoption of IFRS, adoption of new and revised Standards (Continued)**

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations
which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some
cases had not yet been endorsed by the EU):

IFRS 9 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Financial Instruments_
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) . . . . . . . . . _Sale or contribution of assets_
IFRS 10 and IAS 28 (amendments) . . . . . . . . . _Investment entities applying the consolidation exception_
IFRS 14 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Regulatory Deferral Accounts_
IFRS 15 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Revenue from Contracts with Customers_
IAS 7 (amendments) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Statement of Cash Flows Disclosure Initiative_
IAS 12 (amendments) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses_
IAS 27 (amendments) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _Investment Entities_

The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a
material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except that IFRS 9 will impact
both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments. Whilst the expectation is that IFRS 15 will
not have a material impact, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable quantification of the effect of this
standard until a detailed review has been completed.

In addition IFRS 16 _Leases, which was not applied in these financial statements, was issued in January_
2016 but is not yet effective, and has not yet been EU endorsed. The directors expect that the adoption of
this standard will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods,
primarily through the recognition of the Group’s operating leases on the balance sheet (see operating lease
commitments disclosed in note 29) however it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the
effect of this standard until a detailed review has been completed.

**3 Significant accounting policies**

**(a) Basis of preparation**

For periods up to and including the year ended 30 June 2015, the Group prepared its statements in
accordance with UK GAAP. The financial framework which now applies to entities preparing financial
statements in accordance with legislation, regulation or accounting standards applicable in the UK and the
Republic of Ireland is FRS 100, Application of Financial Reporting Requirements, which was issued in
November 2012. These standards are mandatory for statutory financial statements for accounting periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2015. Pursuant to the introduction of these new standards, the Group has
adopted EU-endorsed IFRS, which is an acceptable basis of reporting under FRS 100, and therefore the
Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of certain
properties, or financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each
reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the
fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The principal accounting policies
adopted are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently across the comparative financial
periods included within these financial statements.

IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of
an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is
determined on such a basis. Exceptions to this principle have been made for leasing transactions that are
within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that are approximations to fair value but are not fair value,
such as value in use in IAS 36.

F-11


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance
of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the entity can access at the measurement date;

- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

With the exception of the items impacted by IFRS 1 (and therefore the retrospective exemptions taken for
periods prior to the date of transition), the policies set out below have been applied consistently
throughout the current and preceding years in the financial statements.

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared under FRS 101 and are included in this report—
see page 120.

**(b) Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 30 June 2016.

Control is achieved when the Company:

- has demonstrable power over the relevant activities of the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date the Company
gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Intra group profits have been eliminated. Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the
Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts
significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. Associates are accounted for using the equity
method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’. Joint
ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

**(c) Going concern**

The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance
and position are presented within the Strategic report on pages 8 to 38. In addition, notes 21, 23 and 25 to
the consolidated financial statements include details of the Group’s treasury activities, long-term funding
arrangements, financial instruments and financial risk management activities.

The Group has sufficient financial resources which, together with internally generated cash flows, will
continue to provide sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its current operations, including its contractual
and commercial commitments as set out in note 29.

The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**(d) Business combinations**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Goodwill is measured as the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree
(if any) less the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed.

**(e) Goodwill**

Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out in note 3(d).

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is indication of
impairment (see note 3(p)).

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.

**(f)** **Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the gross inflow of economic benefit for services provided utilising Arqiva’s
communications infrastructure, completion of significant engineering projects and the sale of
communications equipment. Revenue is stated net of value added tax. Revenue is measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in line with the service provision over the contractual
period. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction
will flow to the group and the amount of revenue and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Such
revenues include television and radio transmission services, tower site rental to mobile network operators,
media services, WiFi services and machine-to-machine connectivity.

For long-term services contracts revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the contract.
However, if the performance pattern is other than straight line, revenue is recognised as services are
provided, usually on an output or network coverage basis. Such revenues include Smart metering network
build and service operation.

Costs related to delivering services under long-term contractual arrangements are expensed as incurred.
Pre-contract costs incurred in the initial set up phase of a contract are deferred. These costs are then
recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining contractual term, unless the
pattern of service delivery indicates a different profile is appropriate. These costs are directly attributable
to specific contracts, relate to future activity, will generate future economic benefits and are assessed for
recoverability on a regular basis.

Arqiva provides support to its customers by undertaking various engineering projects. Revenue from such
projects, which are long-term (greater than 12 months) contractual arrangements are recognised based on
the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is estimated using an appropriate measure
according to the nature of the contract. Profit is recognised, if the final outcome can be assessed with
reasonable certainty, by including revenue and related costs in the income statement as contract activity
progresses.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Sale of communications equipment_

Revenue from the sale of communications equipment is recognised when the significant risks and rewards
of ownership are transferred to the buyer, which is typically upon delivery and acceptance by the customer.

Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more elements that are separable and have value to a
customer on a standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
The total contract consideration is allocated between the separate elements on the basis of relative fair
value and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are applied to each element. Likewise where
elements of a contract, or multiple contracts, are so intrinsically linked that it is necessary to consider the
elements on a bundled basis revenue is recognised in respect of the bundled contractual obligations taken
as a whole.

Cash received or invoices raised in advance is taken to deferred income and recognised as revenue when
the services are provided. Where consideration received in advance is discounted, reflecting a significant
financing component, it is reflected within revenue and interest payable and similar charges on a gross
basis. Revenue recognised in advance of cash being received or an invoice being raised is recognised as
accrued income.

**(g) Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

The Group as lessor

Equipment leased to customers under finance leases is deemed to be sold at normal selling price and this
value is taken to revenue at the inception of the lease. Receivables under finance leases represent
outstanding amounts due under these agreements, less finance charges allocated to future periods. Finance
lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return
on the net cash investments.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

The Group as lessee

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group at their fair value or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease
obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which
case they are capitalised in accordance with the group’s general policy on borrowing costs (see note 3(i)).
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating
leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised
as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the
time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**(h) Foreign currencies**

The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary
economic environment in which it operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated
financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds
sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the
consolidated financial statements.

In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the
entity’s functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the
dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated
in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at
fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when
the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a
foreign currency are not retranslated.

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s
foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and
expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate
significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in
equity (attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate).

**(i)** **Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets,
which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or
sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use or sale.

Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure
on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.

All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.

**(j)** **Government grants**

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with
the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the
Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or
otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the consolidated statement of
financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of
the related assets.

**(k) Operating profit**

Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional impairment and restructuring costs, and after the
share of results of associates but before finance income and finance costs.

**(l)** **Retirement benefits**

Defined Contribution Schemes

For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement benefits is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable for the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the statement of financial position.

F-15

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Defined Benefit Schemes

Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the
Group, in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and
liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and terms
to the scheme liabilities.

The Group presents current and past service costs within cost of sales and administrative expenses (see
note 31) in its consolidated income statement. Curtailments gains and losses are accounted for as
past-service cost.

Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance costs (see note 10).

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents
the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is
limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the schemes or
reductions in future contributions to the schemes.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw
the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

**(m) Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

Current tax

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

Deferred tax

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation
of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are
generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary
differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**(n) Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historic purchase cost (which includes costs directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition), being fair value for tangible assets acquired on
acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Assets in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, or for purposes not
yet determined, are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets
includes the cost of materials and direct labour.

Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with
the group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets,
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than freehold land and
properties under construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each
reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their lease term and their expected
useful lives (on the same basis as owned assets).

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal
of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset, and is recognised in the income statement.

**(o) Intangible assets**

Recognition and measurement

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on
a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, on the following bases:

**Asset Description** **Estimated Useful Life**

Internally-generated intangible assets—research and development expenditure

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an
internal project) is recognised if, and only if all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

- the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

- how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and
to use or sell the intangible asset; and

- the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure
incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no
internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or
loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that
are acquired separately.

De-recognition of intangible assets

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from
use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit
or loss when the asset is derecognised.

**(p) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets**

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other
assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated
to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating
units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill (see note 3(e)), is tested for impairment
at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is

F-18


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the impairment relates to goodwill, in which case it cannot
be reversed.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from
the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss, presented as an ‘other gain or
loss’.

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe
established by the market concerned.

**_Financial assets_**

The Group’s financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair
value through profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL’), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.

_Trade receivables_

Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk
of change in value.

**_Financial liabilities_**

Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial liabilities’
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

_Borrowings_

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method, and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.

_Trade payables_

Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.

_Derivative financial instruments_

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross
currency swaps. Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 25.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered
into and are revalued at fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value of these instruments is
determined from the expected future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The future cash flows
are estimated based on forward (interest/inflation/exchange) rates observable from rates and yield curves
at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates. The difference between the fair value at the
risk-adjusted rate and the fair value at the risk-free rate is used to determine the debit valuation
adjustment and/or credit valuation adjustment to these instruments. The Group does not apply hedge
accounting principles.

A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative
fair value is recognised as a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a
non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not
expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets or
current liabilities.

**(q) Provisions**

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of
money is material).

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered
from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be
received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

Decommissioning provisions are recognised within provisions for liabilities and charges and included
within property, plant and equipment, where the costs of dismantling assets are considered material. The
amounts recognised within property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the useful economic life of
the asset. The provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where material.

When the probability that the Group will be required to settle an obligation or a reliable estimate cannot
be made of the amount of the obligation the Group discloses a contingent liability in the notes to the
financial statements.

**(r)** **Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash includes cash at bank and in hand and bank deposits repayable on demand.

**(s)** **Interest**

Interest income and expense are accounted for on an accruals basis and comprise amounts receivable on
deposits and payable on borrowings and finance leases.

**(t)** **Dividends**

Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or
their payment.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**(u) Exceptional items**

Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature or so material that
the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid the distortion of underlying
performance. Underlying performance is the reported performance excluding significant one-off and
non-recurring events that more fairly represents the on-going trading performance of the business. These
items are presented separately on the face of the income statement.

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

**_Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying the Group’s accounting policies_**

The following are the critical judgements and those involving estimations that the Directors have made in
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in financial statements.

_Revenue recognition_

In applying the group’s revenue recognition policy, as set out in note 3, judgements are made in respect of
certain areas including:

- determination of distinct contract components and performance obligations;

- measurement of variable consideration;

- determination of fair value of non-cash consideration;

- the recognition of a significant financing component; and

- in the application of the percentage of completion approach to long-term contractual arrangements
which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs, as well as reliable
measurement of the progress made towards completion.

Such judgments are consistently applied across similar contracts and key estimates are regularly monitored
throughout the relevant contractual periods with reference to the stage of completion and any applicable
customer milestone acceptance. This is particularly relevant to the approach for significant engineering
projects, such as the 700MHz clearance programme, which typically contain a programme build phase and
a long-term operational phase.

_Deferred tax_

The largest element of deferred tax that requires judgement relates to tax losses carried forward (see
note 20). Applicable accounting standards permit the recognition of deferred tax assets only to the extent
that future taxable profits will be generated to utilise the tax losses carried forward. The assessment of
future taxable profits involves significant estimation uncertainty, principally relating to an assessment of
management’s projections of future taxable income based on business plans and on-going tax planning
strategies.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

_Useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangibles_

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires estimation. Depreciation or
amortisation is charged to the income statement based upon the useful lives selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will derive benefit from these assets.

The Group manages its property, plant and equipment on a portfolio basis through a central estates team.
This team contains qualified surveyors who have a wealth of experience working for the Group and within
the industry as a whole.

The carrying values of intangibles are disclosures in note 15, and those for property, plant and equipment
are disclosed in note 16.

_Provisions and contingent liabilities_

As disclosed in note 26, the Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising from contractual
obligations, restructuring and property remediation plans and decommissioning obligations.

Estimates have been made in respect of the probable future obligations of the Group. These estimates are
reviewed annually to reflect current economic conditions and strategic plans.

Management exercises judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 29)
through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise, and in quantifying the possible
range of financial outcomes.

_Impairment of goodwill_

The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment, in compliance with the Group’s accounting policies. Deciding the
recoverable amount of a line of business to which goodwill is attributed involves management estimates.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the value in use.

The Company determines these values using methods based on discounted cash flows. These discounted
cash flows are founded on five-year projections built on financial plans approved by the Board. The cash
flow projections take account of past experience, and are based on management’s best estimates of future
developments based on contracted growth and necessary expenditure to maintain the assets required to
generate that expected revenue. Cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using an expected
terminal growth rate.

The most important assumptions underlying the changes in value in use involve estimates of the discount
rate (with reference to weighted average costs of capital), projected cash flows and terminal growth rate.

The carrying amount of goodwill at the statement of financial position date is disclosed in note 14.

_Discount rate used to determine the carrying amount of the Group’s defined benefit obligation_

The Group’s defined benefit obligation is discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the end
of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is required when setting the
criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The most
significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds,
quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The Group selects these
assumptions in consultation with an external qualified actuary. Additionally, the present value of the
scheme liabilities depend on such factors as the life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of
our current employees and price inflation.

Estimates are used for all of these factors in determining the pension costs and liabilities incorporated in
our financial statements. The assumptions reflect historical experience and our judgement regarding future
expectations. The value of the net pension obligation at 30 June 2016, the key financial assumptions used
to measure the obligation, the sensitivity of the IAS 19 (Revised 2011) pension liability at 30 June 2016,

F-22

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

and of the income statement charge in the year then ended to changes in these assumptions are disclosed
in note 31.

_Fair value measurements and valuation processes_

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is
available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses estimation techniques in accordance with
the requirements of IFRS 13. This includes the assessment of the fair value adjustments with respect to
credit risk (specifically debit valuation adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities) for which
the Group incorporates market-observable data into its valuation techniques.

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets
and liabilities are disclosed in notes 14 and 25.

_Providing for doubtful debts_

The Group provides services primarily to business customers, mainly on credit terms. On occasion certain
debts may not be paid through default of our customers. Estimates, based upon our historical experience
and credit rating systems, are used in determining the level of debt that we do not expect to be collected.
The value of the provision for doubtful debts is disclosed in note 18.

**5 Revenue and segmental information**

The Group derives its revenue from the rendering of services and the sale of communications equipment.
See note 3(f) for the accounting policies adopted.

**Segmental reporting**

Information reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) (which is collectively the
Group’s Board of Directors, CEO and CFO) for the purposes of resource allocation and the assessment of
segmental performance is focused on the three customer-facing business units, supported by central
corporate functions which are non-revenue generating. The Group’s reportable segments under IFRS 8
are therefore:

- Terrestrial Broadcast;

- Telecoms & M2M; and

- Satellite and Media.

‘Other’ segments refers to our corporate business unit, which is non-revenue generating.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies
described in note 3. Segmental result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of
the reconciling items above or central administration costs including investment revenue and finance costs,
and income tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Group’s CODM for the purpose of resource
allocation and assessment of segment performance.

For the purpose of monitoring segment performance and allocating resources between segments, the
CODM monitors the capital expenditure (presented on a cash basis) planned and utilised by each segment,
an analysis of which is shown below.

**12 Tax on loss on ordinary activities (Continued)**

Corporation tax is calculated at 20.0% (2015: 20.75%; 2014: 22.5%) of the estimated taxable profit for the
year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

The (credit) / charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit in the income statement as follows:

In Finance Act 2013, the main rate of UK corporation tax was reduced from 23.0% to 21.0% with effect
from 1 April 2014 and to 20.0% from 1 April 2015. For the purpose of this current tax charge analysis a
rate of 20.0% (2015: 20.75%; 2014: 22.50%) has been used. Changes to the UK corporation tax rates were
substantively enacted as part of Finance Bill 2015 on 26 October 2015. These include reductions to the
main rate to 19% from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020. UK deferred tax has therefore been
considered at the reduced rate of 18.0% (2015: 20.0%; 2014: 20.0%; 2013: 23.0%) as this is the rate at
which deferred tax balances are forecast to unwind.

On 16 March 2016 it was announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax would be further reduced to
17.0% from 1 April 2020. As this change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date its
effect is not included in these financial statements.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, the following amounts relating to tax have
been recognised in other comprehensive income:

**Group** **Group** **Group**

The Group disposed of £1.7m of goodwill in association with the disposal of a subsidiary (see note 30). The
amount disposed of was treated as a cost of disposal and a reduction in the net profit recognised in the
income statement.

Additionally, the Group disposed of £22.8m of goodwill (fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2015) in
association with the disposal of non-core areas of the business. This primarily related to the disposal of the
Secure Solutions business.

Impairment during the year ended 30 June 2015 relates to the write down of the carrying value of non-core
business areas and investments.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The CGUs that have associated
goodwill are Terrestrial Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and Satellite & Media. These are the smallest
identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that
goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use
calculations (‘VIU’). The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding the discount rates,
growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period for which management has detailed
plans. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of
the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Growth rates are based on internal and
external growth forecasts. Changes to cash flows are based on past practices and expectations of future
changes in the market.

_Recoverable amount_

The value in use of each CGU is determined from the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent
financial forecasts approved by the Board for the next five years. They reflect management’s expectations
of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure and working capital based on past experience and future
expectations of performance.

_Discount rate_

The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived using the capital asset pricing
model for comparable businesses. The assumptions used are benchmarked to externally available data.

_Terminal growth rates_

The terminal growth rate is determined based on the long-term growth rates of the regions in which the
CGU operates (2016: 2.1%; 2015: 2.3%; 2014: 2.1%; 2013: 2.1%). The growth rate has been benchmarked
against externally available data. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the
relevant markets.

_Sensitivities_

There is significant headroom in all CGUs. For Satellite and Media, the value in use exceeds the carrying
value of the CGU by approximately £50.0m. The following changes to key assumptions (in isolation) would
cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value:

- An increase in the discount rate of 300 basis points;

- A reduction in the terminal growth rate of 270 basis points; or

- Shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in terminal cash flows decreasing by £75m
or more.

For Terrestrial Broadcast and Telecoms & M2M no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions
would cause the carrying amount to the CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount.

**17 Interest in associates and joint ventures (Continued)**

During the year ended 30 June 2015 the Group recorded £8.7m impairment against its interest in
associates and joint ventures recognised in the income statement.

The Directors consider the carrying value of the Group’s investments on an annual basis, or more
frequently should indicators arise, and believe that the carrying values of the investments are supported by
the underlying trade and net assets.

The Group’s policy is to recommend providing for trade receivables outstanding for more than 90 days
beyond the agreed terms, or where the business environment indicates a specific risk. Management will
make an assessment of the level of provision based on the Group policy. Adjustments to the calculated
level of provision will be made accordingly.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Before accepting
any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s
credit quality. For further information on how the Group manages credit risk see note 25.

Deferred tax assets are not recognised unless it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits against
which they will be realised. Due to the level of tax deductible interest and capital allowances available, the
group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £205.4m (2015: £216.5m; 2014: £154.6m; 2013: £86.5m).
This is in respect of tax losses £39.9m (2015: £42.3m; 2014: £39.5m; 2013: £23.1m), derivative financial
instruments £163.8m (2015: £174.2m; 2014: £115.1m; 2013: £63.4m) and accelerated tax depreciation
£1.7m (2015: £nil; 2014: £nil; 2013: £nil). These deferred tax assets may be carried forward indefinitely.

This value has been calculated based on the UK corporation tax rate of 18.0% (2015: 20.0%; 2014: 20%;
2013: 23%); the rate substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £nil (2015: £nil; 2014: £nil) relating to
the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timings of the reversal
of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

**23 Borrowings (Continued)**

The fair value of the quoted senior bonds based upon observable market prices was £996.0m (2015:
£983.2m; 2014: £945.2m; 2013: £736.6m) whilst their carrying value was £914.0m (2015: £914.0m; 2014:
£914.0m; 2013: £750.0m).

The fair value of the quoted junior bonds based upon observable market prices was £642.1m (2015:
£662.5m; £688.1m; 2013: £623.7m) whilst their carrying value was £600.0m (2015: £600.0m; £600.0m; 2013:
£600.0m).

The weighted average interest rate of borrowings is 7.86% (2015: 7.82%; 2014: 7.88%).

An analysis of total borrowings (excluding issue costs) by maturity is as follows:

**Bank loans are comprised from the Group’s senior debt. Other loans are comprised from the Group’s senior**
**bonds and junior bonds.**

**Senior debt includes 5-year term bank debt of £353.5m, due in 2018, borrowed by Arqiva Senior Finance Ltd**
under a Senior Facility Agreement (2015: £353.5m; 2014: £653.5m; 2013: £786.0m). The loan has a floating
interest rate which ranges between LIBOR + 2.5% to LIBOR + 4.00% by the end of the agreement. The
Group also holds a £180.0m 10 year term loan from institutional investors (drawn in January 2014) held by
Arqiva Financing No 1 Ltd; and a £190.0m 10 year term loan from the European Investment Bank (‘EIB’),
again held by Arqiva Financing No 1 Ltd.

The Group has £575.0m (2015: £580.0m; 2014: £700.0m; 2013: £700.0m) undrawn facilities available. These
facilities are at floating interest rates. For further information on the Group’s liquidity risk management,
see note 25.

In December 2013, as part of the Group’s smart metering contract we established two further facilities in
Arqiva Smart Financing Limited, a Group company that sits outside the main WBS financing Group. The
Comms Hub Receivables Purchasing (‘CHuRP’) facility allows the Group to borrow up to £30.0m, the Fee
Facility allows the Group to borrow up to £1.6m. At 30 June 2016 a balance of £0.9m (2015: £0.7m; 2014:
£0.5m; 2013: nil) has been drawn against the fee facility, this loan has floating interest rates of
LIBOR + 1.20% and is fully repayable on 30 June 2017. There were no drawdowns on the CHuRP facility
as at 30 June 2016 (2015: nil; 2014: nil), and this loan has floating interest rates which range from
LIBOR + 1.20% to LIBOR + 1.75% during the initial six years of the facility, increasing to
LIBOR + 2.50% at the end of the agreement in June 2026.

**Senior bonds, notes and private placements include the issuance of £750.0m Notes raised in February 2013**
and £164.0m Notes raised in February 2014 by Arqiva Financing Plc, each of which are listed on the
London Stock Exchange. These are rated BBB by Standard & Poors and Fitch. These Notes have fixed
interest rates which range between 4.04% and 5.34% and are repayable between June 2018 and December
2032.

Of the remaining senior bonds, £300.0m were raised in July 2014 at a coupon rate of LIBOR + 2.1%
through a new 15-year amortising US Private Placement debt issue and £398.5m were raised in June 2013
by Arqiva PP Financing Plc through a US Private Placement transaction in a combined sterling and US
dollar denominated offering. These Notes have fixed interest rates which range between 4.101% and
4.420% and have amortising repayment profiles commencing December 2018 with an end maturity date of
June 2025.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**23 Borrowings (Continued)**

All of the above financing instruments have covenants attached, principally an interest cover ratio and a
debt leverage ratio, and benefit from security over substantially all of the Group’s assets under a Whole
Business Securitisation structure. The Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

**Junior bonds of £600.0m represent amounts raised from the issuance of Notes by Arqiva Broadcast**
Finance Plc. These Notes have a fixed interest rate of 9.5% and are repayable in March 2020. These Notes
are listed on the Luxembourg Market and have interest cover and debt leverage covenants attached. The
Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

There have been no breaches of the terms of the loan agreements during the current or previous year.

**24 Obligations under finance leases**

Future minimum payments under finance leases are as follows:

**Total finance leases . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **13.4** **13.8** **14.0** **14.5**

The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

The group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

**Capital risk management**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going
concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (as set out in note 28; see note 21 for cash and cash
equivalents and note 23 for borrowings) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital and share
premium, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests).

To the extent the Group has arrangements with regulators and licence providers, they may include certain
capital requirements.

**Significant accounting policies**

Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis
of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset and
financial liability are disclosed in full in note 3 (q).

The Group’s derivatives (i.e. interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps and swap options) are measured on
a fair value through profit and loss basis. Whilst the Group’s derivatives act as an effective hedge in
economic terms, hedge accounting principles are not applied. This means that the Group’s derivatives are
recognised at their risk-adjusted fair value (i.e. risk-adjusted Mark-to-Market value) at the date they are
entered into and are revalued at each balance sheet date, with gains and losses being reported separately in
the income statement as ‘other gains and losses’. Net amounts paid in the year (excluding termination
amounts) on interest rate swaps (together with similar amounts under the cross currency and index linked
swaps) are reported as a component of net bank and other loan interest within interest payable.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**25 Financial instruments and risk management**

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and
international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the
Group using financial instruments wherever it is appropriate to do so. The Treasury function reports
directly into the Chief Financial Officer and the Group’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, an
independent function with a scope that includes monitoring the risks and policies implemented to mitigate
risk exposures. The main risks addressed by financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign
currency exchange risk. The Group’s policies in respect of these risks, which remain unchanged throughout
the year, are set out below.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign
currency and interest rate risk, including:

- Interest rate swaps, including inflation-linked interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of movement in
interest rates;

- Cross-currency swaps to mitigate the risk of currency exposures on foreign denominated borrowings;
and

- Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage exchange risks arising from transactional foreign
exchange exposures.

The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,
for speculative purposes.

**Foreign currency risk management**

The Group principally operates from UK sites and predominantly in the UK market, but has some
overseas subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. While some customer and
supplier contracts are denominated in other currencies (mainly U.S. dollars and euros), the majority of the
Group’s turnover and costs are sterling based and accordingly exposure to foreign exchange risk is limited.

Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation
risk:

- **_Transactional risk: The Group’s policy is to hedge material transactional currency exposures via the use_**
of forward foreign exchange contracts. The measurement and control of this risk is monitored on a
Group—wide basis.

- **_Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting_**
policy in note 3. Given the Group predominantly operates in the UK, there is a relatively small
exposure with overseas entities accounting for only 0.5% (2015: 0.1%; 2014: 1.1%) of operating profit
and 0.1% (2015: 0.1%; 2014: 0.2%; 2013: 0.1%) of total assets for the Group.

- refers to Singapore dollar, being the most frequently transacted currency within ‘other monetary assets and liabilities’.

Foreign currency denominated cash balances have a weighted average interest rate of 0.0% (2015: 0.0%;
2014: 0.0%).

During the year cross currency swaps (nominal value USD 358.0m) were used to fix the exchange rate to
$1.52/£1 in relation to U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes (nominal value USD 358.0m). This provides
an effective economic hedge of the foreign currency impact on the Sterling cost of future interest and
capital repayment obligations.

After taking into account our hedging activities, management does not consider there to be a material
residual exposure to exchange rates. Accordingly no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

**Interest rate risk management**

The Group has variable rate bank debt and uses interest rate swaps (‘IRS’) and inflation-linked swaps
(‘ILS’) to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates. The Group maintains a hedging policy to manage
interest rate risk and to ensure the certainty of future interest cash flows. The Group has fixed rate
hedging, split between IRS and ILS. IRS convert variable rate interest costs to fixed rate interest costs
while ILS convert fixed or variable rate interest costs to RPI-linked costs, which fluctuate in line with the
RPI index as do a portion of the Group’s revenue contracts. These swaps are entered into on terms
(including maturity) that mirror the debt instrument they hedge, and therefore act as an effective economic
hedge.

As the Group uses hedging to maintain fixed interest rates on all of its material borrowings (excluding
revolving facilities), there is minimal exposure on the interest expense to interest rate movements. A rise or
fall in interest rates would therefore not materially impact the interest expense payable by the Group.

**Liquidity risk management**

To ensure it has sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth, the Group
maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast requirements. Details
of the Group’s debt maturity profile are shown on page 25. The Group carefully manages the counterparty
credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a
range of major financial institutions, which have satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit
rating agencies. The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Group’s on-going risk management
processes, which include a regular review of counterparty credit ratings. Risk in this area is limited further
by setting a maximum level and term for deposits with any single counterparty.

The Group is exposed to credit risk on customer receivables, which is managed through credit-checking
procedures prior to taking on new customers and higher risk customers paying in advance of services being
provided. Performance is closely monitored to ensure agreed service levels are maintained, reducing the
level of queried payments and mitigating the risk of uncollectable debts.

**Financial instruments**

With the exception of derivative financial instruments (which are recognised and measured at fair value
through profit and loss) the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and measured
following the loans and receivables recognition category.

The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 30 June 2016 was 6.10%
(2015: 6.10%; 2014: 5.83%) and the weighted average period of funding was 6.8 years (2015: 7.4 years;
2014: 7.5 years; 2013: 6.9 years).

Within the Group’s financial liabilities were borrowings of £3,150.2m (2015: £3,106.8m; 2014: £6,271.6m;
2013: £6,295.2m) (see note 23), which includes £1,023.5m (2015: £1,023.5m; 2014: £1,023.5m;
2013: £1,023.5m) with floating rate interest and the remainder with fixed rate interest (prior to the hedging
arrangements described previously).

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group seeks to manage the exposures of its debt payment obligations through a combination of
indexed linked, interest rate and cross currency swaps.

At the year end, the Group held interest rate swaps with notional amounts of £1,023.2m which hedge the
interest obligations of the Group’s variable rate debt. The average fixed rate on these instruments is
6.213%. £353.2m of these instruments have mandatory break clauses co-terminus with the 2018 maturity
date of the Group’s floating rate term loan, whilst the remaining £670.0m have maturity dates between
2024 and 2029 which match the maturity dates of the Institutional Term Loan (‘ITL’) and EIB loans and
the amortising 2014 US Private Placement issue.

The Group also holds index linked swaps with notional amounts of £1,312.5m where the Group receives
floating and pays fixed interest obligations to an average rate of 2.906% indexed with RPI. The notional
amounts of these swaps increase with RPI and these accretion amounts are cash settled annually, most
recently in June 2016 (£26.0m). All of these instruments have a maturity date of April 2027, however
£235.0m of these have a mandatory break clause in 2023. These instruments have been entered into to
hedge the Group’s fixed rate debt (namely fixed rate sterling bonds and the 2013 US Private Placement
issue) and in order to ensure that the cash flow characteristics align with these instruments, the Group has
entered into £1,312.5m of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps to match the cash flows on both the
fixed rate debt instruments and the index linked swaps set out above.

In addition, the Group has entered into USD 358.0m of cross-currency swaps to fix the Sterling cost of
future interest and capital repayment obligations relating to the USD tranche of the 2013 Private
Placement at an exchange rate of 1.52.

The fair value of the interest rate, inflation and cross currency swaps at 30 June 2016 excluding the
inflation swap principal accretion of £nil (2015: £nil; 2014: £59.9m; 2013: £20.2m), is a liability of £1,157.2m
(2015: £1,213.1m; 2014: £1,208.8m; 2013: £1,201.5m). This fair value is calculated using a risk-adjusted rate.

The Group holds Swap Options with a total notional principal amount of £353.2m (2015: £410.7m;
2014: £843.2m). The options are exercisable at maturity in February 2018, and hedge the Group’s exposure
for the duration of the interest rate swaps to a decline in LIBOR to below 1%.

position within non-current liabilities:

included to both match underlying facility maturities and to optimise the availability and cost of hedging
lines with our derivative counterparties.

**Fair value hierarchy**

Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into
levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices); and

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for
the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Interest rate swaps, inflation rate swaps, swap options and cross-currency swaps (as disclosed on above) are
all classed as level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. In each case the items are valued based upon discounted
cash flow. Future cash flows are estimated based on forward (interest/inflation/exchange) rates observable
from rates and yield curves at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates, discounted at a
risk-adjusted rate.

**26 Provisions (Continued)**

The onerous contract provision relates to supplier contracts where the costs are expected to exceed the
benefits, and onerous lease contracts where the buildings are empty but lease costs are being incurred. The
provision is expected to be utilised over the next five years.

Provisions are made for decommissioning and asset at risk costs where the Group has an obligation to
restore sites and the cost of restoration is not recoverable from third parties. The provision is in relation to
assets of which the remaining useful economic life ranges up to 18 years.

The restructuring provision relates to the costs of a reorganisation of Group operations which will be
utilised during the next financial year.

The remediation provision represents the cost of works identified as being required across a number of the
Group’s sites and is expected to be utilised over the next one to three years.

Other provisions represent a variety of smaller items which are expected to be utilised over the next one to
three years.

The merger reserve arose as a result of the true and fair override on the acquisition of the Arqiva UK
Broadcast Holdings Limited (‘AUKBH’) sub-group in 2007.

The capital contribution reserve in the Group was recognised as a result of a capital contribution from the
Company’s immediate parent offset by the cumulative effect of intra-group releases. This reserve is
non-distributable in accordance with section 830 of the Companies Act 2006. The release of amounts owed
by AF1 to Arqiva Group Intermediate Limited (indirectly held subsidiaries within the Group) was treated
as realised.

**31 Retirement benefits**

**Defined contribution scheme**

Arqiva Limited has operated a Defined Contribution Scheme during the year, for those employees who are
not members of the Group’s Defined Benefit Plan. Contributions payable in respect of this Scheme for the
year were £7.0m (2015: £6.4m; 2014: £6.0m). The assets of the Scheme are held outside of the Group.

An amount of £0.6m (2015: £0.9m; 2014: £1.0m) is included in accruals being the outstanding contributions
to the Defined Contribution Scheme.

**Defined benefit plan**

In the year to 30 June 2016, the Group operated one Defined Benefit Plan, sponsored by Arqiva Limited.
The Defined Benefit Plan is administered by a separate entity that is legally separated from the Group,
and therefore the Plan assets are held separately from those of Arqiva Limited. The trustees of the Plan
are required by law to act in the interests of the Plan and of all relevant stakeholders in the Plan. The
trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the Plan assets.

The Plan typically exposes the Group to risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity risk.

**Investment risk . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability for IAS19 purposes is
calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality
corporate bond yields, which is different to how the Plan assets are invested.
Currently the Plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt
instruments and real estate. Due to the long-term nature of the Plan liabilities,
the trustees of the Plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the
Plan assets should be invested in equity securities to leverage the expected return
generated by the Plan assets.

**Interest risk . . . . . . .** A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the valuation of the Plan’s
IAS19 liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the
Plan’s corporate bond investments.

**Longevity risk . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference
to a best estimate of the mortality of Plan participants both during and after their
retirement. An increase in the life expectancy of the Plan participants will
increase the Plan’s assessed liability.

**Salary risk . . . . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference
to the future salaries of Plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the
Plan participants will increase the Plan’s liability.

The Plan closed to the future accrual of benefits on 31 January 2016. The weighted average duration of the
expected benefit payments from the Plan is around 21 years.

**31 Retirement benefits (Continued)**

The most recent triennial actuarial funding valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the
defined benefit liability was carried out at 30 June 2014 by an independent firm of consulting actuaries.
The present value of the IAS19 defined benefit liability, and the related current service cost and past
service cost, have been measured using the projected unit credit method based on roll-forward updates to
the triennial valuation figures.

The principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows:

**31 Retirement benefits (Continued)**

The major categories and fair values of Plan assets at the end of the reporting period for each category are
as follows:

**30 June 2016** **30 June 2015** **30 June 2014**
**£’m** **£’m** **£’m**

The majority of the Plan’s equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.

The Plan includes holdings of gilts and corporate bonds, which are intended to partially hedge the financial
risk from liability valuation movements associated with changes in gilt and corporate bond yields.
IAS19 liability movements from changes in the discount rate will also be partially hedged by the Plan’s
corporate bond holding.

No amounts within the fair value of the Plan assets are in respect of the Group’s own financial instruments
or any property occupied by, or assets used by, the Group.

Following completion of the latest funding valuation as at 30 June 2014, Arqiva Limited has agreed to pay
deficit contributions of £2.5m per annum to 31 July 2018, and then payments of £3.3m per annum to July
2020. As such, the Group anticipates contributions to the defined benefit plan for the year ending 30 June
2017 will be £2.5m.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The assumptions considered to be the most significant are the discount rate adopted, inflation represented
by RPI, and the longevity assumptions.

The sensitivity of the 2016 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **movement of 0.1%** **RPI movement of 0.1%** **movement of 1 year**

Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £4.7m £4.8m £5.6m

The sensitivity of the 2015 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **movement of 0.1%** **RPI movement of 0.1%** **movement of 1 year**

(Decrease) / Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . (£3.9m) (£4.0m) £4.4m

The sensitivity of the 2014 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **movement of 0.1%** **RPI movement of 0.1%** **movement of 1 year**

(Decrease) / Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . (£3.7m) (£3.3m) £0.3m

This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as
it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.

The Group anticipates contributions to the defined benefit Plan for the year ending 30 June 2017 will be
£nil due to the closure of the scheme to future accrual.

**35 First time adoption of IFRSs**

The following tables present the recognition and measurement differences relating the presentation of
financial performance and position under IFRS. ‘As report under UK GAAP’ refers to the historic
UK GAAP framework prevailing at each respective reporting date. The financial reporting framework
which now applies to entities preparing financial statements in accordance with legislation, regulation or
accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland is FRS 100, Application of
Financial Reporting Requirements, which was issued in November 2012. FRS 100 includes EU-endorsed
IFRS, FRS 101 (IFRS with a reduced disclosure framework) and FRS 102 (a framework based on IFRS)
as permissible reporting frameworks. These standards are mandatory for statutory financial statements for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015. Pursuant to the introduction of these new
standards, the Group has adopted IFRS for these consolidated financial statements.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**35 First time adoption of IFRSs (Continued)**

**A.** **Goodwill and intangibles**

On transition to IFRS, and in accordance with IFRS 1, goodwill has continued to be recognised at its
carrying value.

Under UK GAAP, these goodwill balances were amortised in line with the Group’s previous accounting
policy. The amortisation for the years ended 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 has therefore been reversed to
present the IFRS position as at 30 June 2015 and 30 June 2014 respectively. As a result, an additional
£5.2m of impairment was recognised in the year ended 30 June 2015.

Under IFRS, acquisition related fees (£0.1m) that arose in the year ended 30 June 2014 and were
capitalised as part of the carrying value of goodwill under UK GAAP, were re-classified as administrative
expenses within the income statement.

**B.** **Software and development costs**

Under UK GAAP software and certain associated development costs were reported as tangible assets
(carrying value at 30 June 2015: £30.5m; 30 June 2014: £33.7m; 1 July 2013: £24.1m). Under IAS 38, these
capitalised costs are reclassified and presented as an intangible asset and amortised in line with the
Group’s accounting policy which is the same as the previous depreciation charges.

**C.** **Classification of provisions**

On adoption of IAS 37 Provisions and contingent liabilities, the element that is anticipated to fall due within
one financial year has been separately presented as a current liability (carrying value at 30 June 2015:
£11.2m; 30 June 2014: £7.4m; 1 July 2013: £7.2m) with the remaining balance presented as a non-current
liability.

**D.** **Recognition of derivative financial instruments and de-recognition of associated financial instruments**

The fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments (fair value liability at 30 June 2015:
£1,210.3m; 30 June 2014: £1,267.0m; 1 July 2013: £1,218.8m) is recognised under IFRS, and was not
recognised under UK GAAP. Their recognition at fair value is determined from the present value of the
expected future cash flows when compared to prevailing market rates, discounted at a risk-adjusted
discount rate.

The swap premium (carrying value at 30 June 2015: £16.6m within current liabilities and £172.0m within
non-current liabilities; 30 June 2014: £9.1m within current liabilities and £94.5m within non-current
liabilities; nil at 1 July 2013) previously recognised under UK GAAP requires de-recognition as its fair
value is included within the fair value of the derivative instrument itself. In addition, principal accretion on
inflation linked swaps, which had previously been recognised as a separate liability under UK GAAP
(carrying value at 30 June 2015: nil; 30 June 2014: £59.9m; 1 July 2013: £20.2m), has been derecognised as
a separate financial instrument and incorporated into the fair value and fair value movements of the
inflation linked swaps to which it relates.

Certain historic derivative ‘exit’ costs (carrying value at 30 June 2015: £75.9m within non-current assets;
30 June 2014: £85.5m; 1 July 2013: £95.0m) which had been recognised on balance sheet under UK GAAP
were de-recognised as they reflect the crystallisation of losses on previously held derivatives (not
recognised under UK GAAP) when these instruments were disposed of. Under IFRS, the losses on
de-recognition of the derivative instruments would have been recorded in profit and loss and therefore
impact brought forward retained earnings under IFRS.

Under UK GAAP, the Group applied an adjustment (following the principles of SSAP 20 Foreign Currency
_Translation) to reduce foreign currency volatility on the balance sheet and profit and loss account in_
relation to its US dollar denominated borrowings. The cumulative effective of this adjustment has been
reversed on transition to IFRS (carrying value at 30 June 2015: £7.8m; 30 June 2014: £25.1m; 1 July 2013
£0.6m).

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**35 First time adoption of IFRSs (Continued)**

**E.** **Debt issue costs**

Under UK GAAP, certain costs capitalised and amortised in association with the issue of debt and its
maturity profile (respectively), are treated as profit and loss items under IFRS where the instrument itself
is measured on a fair value through profit and loss basis. These costs (carrying value at 30 June 2015:
£1.3m; 30 June 2014: £2.9m; 1 July 2013: £6.7m) have been de-recognised in full.

**F.** **Deferred tax**

IFRS defines deferred tax in relation to temporary differences between carrying values and their related
tax bases, rather than timing differences in the profit or loss, therefore adjustments are required to
recognise a number of items for which no deferred tax was recognised under UK GAAP. This principally
relates to the fair value moment on derivative financial instruments (which was not required to be recorded
on the Group’s UK GAAP balance sheet). The Group’s accounting policy under IFRS, and previously
under UK GAAP, is to recognise these differences as a deferred tax asset to the extent to which it is
considered recoverable. Based on the forecasts available to management as at 1 July 2013 an additional
£103.4m of deferred tax was recognised.

**G.** **Retirement benefits—Statement of Financial Position**

In the UK GAAP reported financial position at 30 June 2015, the Group restricted its recognition of its
retirement benefit surplus on application of the rules of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits. On adoption of IFRS
and application of IAS 19 _Employee benefits, the Group has been able to support its recognition of its_
retirement benefits surplus in full and therefore presents an asset of £6.6m as at 30 June 2015.

**H.** **Non-controlling interest**

A presentational adjustment has been made to analyse the comprehensive loss for the year between that
attributable to the owners of the Company and that attributable to non-controlling interests, i.e. the loss
for the year is presented on a gross-basis.

**I.** **Income statement classification**

A presentational adjustment has been made to align the classification of certain operating costs and costs
relating to certain cost of sales activities.

**J.** **Retirement benefits—Income Statement**

Under IFRS the net finance cost associated with the Group’s defined benefit scheme is calculated based
upon the deficit/surplus position in place at the start of the accounting period and the discount rate in
force. Under UK GAAP, this was calculated based upon the expected return on assets.

**K.** **Finance costs**

Finance costs have been adjusted to reflect:

- The impact of the de-recognition of the swap premium, deferred derivative close out costs, certain
debt issue costs and adjustments for foreign currency movements (2015 aggregate impact: £21.7m
charge on conversion; 2014: £35.7m credit on conversion);

- The presentation of unrealised foreign currency movements on US$ denominated debt as ‘other gains
and losses’ (2015: £17.5m charge; 2014: £24.2m gain)

- Adjustments with respect to the IAS 19 calculation of the return on scheme assets (2015: £1.6m; 2014:
£3.5m);

- The grossing up of the fair value movement on derivatives to include the movement of principal
accretion on inflation linked swaps charged to profit and loss (2015: £15.0m; 2014: £39.7m) (see
note L); and

F-62

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**35 First time adoption of IFRSs (Continued)**

- The de-recognition of swap break costs (2015: £100.5m; 2014: £112.3m), classified as exceptional
financing costs under UK GAAP where these are represented in the opening balances.

**L.** **Other gains and losses**

Other gains and losses present:

- Fair value movements on derivatives including principal accretion (see notes D and K);

- Unrealised foreign currency movements on US$ denominated debt as described in note K.

- Exceptional break costs on the exit of swap arrangements which were cash settled (in the year ended
30 June 2014);

- Exceptional proceeds on the disposal of the swap options (in the year ended 30 June 2015) reclassified
from exceptional finance income.

**M.** **Restatement of cash flow statement from UK GAAP to IFRS**

The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect upon the cash flows generated by the Group. The
IFRS cash flow statement is presented in a different format from that required under UK GAAP with cash
flows split into three categories of activities—operating activities, investing activities and financing
activities. The reconciling items between the UK GAAP presentation and the IFRS presentation have no
net impact on the cash flows generated.

**Independent Auditors’ report to the Members of Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited**

Report on the audit of the financial statements

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the
‘‘financial statements’’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s
affairs as at 30 June 2017 and of the Group’s loss and cash flows for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the European Union;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising
FRS 101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the financial statements, included within the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial
Statements (the ‘‘Annual Report’’), which comprise: the consolidated statement of financial position and
the Company statement of financial position as at 30 June 2017, the consolidated income statement, the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated cash flow statement, the consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the Company notes to the financial statements,
which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘‘ISAs (UK)’’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applicable to
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

financial statements.

**_The scope of our audit_**

As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement
in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of
management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the
directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.

**_Key audit matters_**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks
of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing
the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our
procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and
in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a
complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

Where contract variations arose we assessed the
appropriateness and timing of the recognition of
the related revenues by obtaining an understanding
of the reason for the variations and the timing of
their delivery and validated this to the signed
contract variation addendums.

Through our procedures performed we assessed
whether the revenue recognised on the contracts
was in line with the Group accounting policies and

Our testing did not identify any material differences
in relation to revenue and profit recognition on
these complex contracts.

This is considered a key audit matter due to the
complexity of the valuations and the quantum of
balances involved.

what we would expect for the business units.

Based on this testing, we considered whether the
carrying value of these intangibles was adequately
supported by the value-in-use impairment model
prepared by management, and found there to be a
significant level of headroom.

For the Company’s investment in subsidiaries we
have compared the net assets of the subsidiary at
30 June 2017 with the carrying value of the
investment. For any subsidiaries where net assets do
not exceed the carrying value, for example the
entities which hold the Group’s debt, we have
looked further down the Group hierarchy at the
subsidiaries held by that entity and confirmed that,
by taking into account the net assets of these, the
carrying value of the investment held in the
Company is supported.

We also considered for both the Group and
Company positions whether there are any further
indicators which would cause there to be an
impairment and found that to be unlikely.

**_How we tailored the audit scope_**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company,
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited’s business is carried out through two principal trading subsidiaries,
aligned into three customer-facing business units; Terrestrial Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and Satellite
and Media, supported by the Group’s corporate functions. In addition there are a number of entities which
provide financing to the operations.

All of the audit work including the audit of the consolidation has been performed by the Group
engagement team since the accounting is performed in Arqiva’s Winchester location.

**_Materiality_**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

**_Overall materiality_** £15.5 million (2016: £14.8 million). £86.7 million (2016: £14.8 million).

**_How we determined_** 5% of profit before interest, tax, other 2% of total assets, capped in the prior

generally accepted auditing benchmark. benchmark.

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components was between £0.7 million and
£14 million. Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than
our overall Group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our
audit above £0.5 million (Group audit) (2016: £0.5 million) and £0.5 million (Company audit) (2016:
£0.5 million) as well as misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for
qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to
report to you when:

- the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is not appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as
to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Reporting on other information

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report and Consolidated Financial
Statements other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are
responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other
information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, any form of assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report, we also considered whether the disclosures
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs
(UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2017 is consistent with the financial
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and parent Company and their environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report
and Directors’ Report.

Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 57, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such
internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or
the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Notes to the Group financial statements**

**1 General information, authorisation of financial statements and Statement of Compliance**

Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited (‘ABPL’) (‘the Company’) is a private company limited by shares and
incorporated in England, in the United Kingdom (‘UK’) under the Companies Act 2006 under registration
number 08085823. The address of the registered office is Crawley Court, Winchester, Hampshire, England
SO21 2QA.

These consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 30 June
2017 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together the ‘‘Group’’).

The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in the strategic report on
pages 8 to 40.

**_Statement of Compliance_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘‘IFRS’’) (including International Accounting Standards (‘‘IAS’’) and interpretations
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘‘IASB’’) and its committees) as adopted for use
in the European Union (‘‘EU’’) and the Companies Act 2006.

The Company has elected to prepare its financial statements in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced
Disclosure Framework. These are presented on pages 126 to 134.

**2 Adoption of new and revised Standards**

Management have performed an impact assessment on the adoption of IFRS 15 and do not expect it to
have a material impact on the financial statements. With the exception of IFRS 16, the directors do not
expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material
impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.

IFRS 16 Leases, which is not yet endorsed for use in the EU, is expected to have a material impact on the
financial statements of the Group in future periods. This is primarily through the recognition of the
Group’s operating leases on the balance sheet and reclassification of costs in the income statement leading
to an increase in EBITDA, however it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of
this standard until a more detailed review has been completed. Further details of the Group’s operating
lease commitments are shown in note 28.

**3 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**

The financial framework which now applies to entities preparing financial statements in accordance with
legislation, regulation or accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland is
FRS 100, Application of Financial Reporting Requirements, which was issued in November 2012. These
standards are mandatory for statutory financial statements for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 January 2015. Pursuant to the introduction of these new standards, the Group adopted EU-endorsed
IFRS, which is an acceptable basis of reporting under FRS 100, and therefore the Group financial
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to
companies applying IFRS and in accordance with IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of
financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in
the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given
in exchange for goods and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. These
policies have been applied consistently across the comparative financial periods included within these
financial statements.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared under FRS 101 and are included in this report—
see page 126.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries, together the Group) made up to 30 June 2017.

Control is achieved when the Company:

- has demonstrable power over the relevant activities of the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date the Company
gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Intra-group profits have been eliminated. Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the
Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts
significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. Where the Group has an investment that has
joint control, this is treated as a joint venture. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’.

**Going concern**

The Group meets its day-to-day working capital and financing requirements through the net cash
generated from its operations. The Group has access to sufficient financial resources which, together with
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its current
operations, including its contractual and commercial commitments as set out in note 28. For this reason
the Directors are confident that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for
the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing
these financial statements.

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for the allocation of
resources and assessment of performance of the operating segments, has been identified as collectively the
Board of Directors, which includes the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the gross inflow of economic benefit for services provided utilising Arqiva’s
communications infrastructure, completion of significant engineering projects and the sale of
communications equipment. Revenue is stated net of value added tax. Revenue is measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable.

Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more elements that are separable and have value to a
customer on a standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
The total contract consideration is allocated between the separate elements on the basis of relative fair
value and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are applied to each element. Likewise where
elements of a contract, or multiple contracts, are so intrinsically linked that it is necessary to consider the

F-79


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

elements on a bundled basis revenue is recognised in respect of the bundled contractual obligations taken
as a whole.

Cash received or invoices raised in advance is taken to deferred income and recognised as revenue when
the services are provided. Where consideration received in advance is discounted, reflecting a significant
financing component, it is reflected within revenue and interest payable and similar charges on a gross
basis. Revenue recognised in advance of cash being received or an invoice being raised is recognised as
accrued income.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in line with the service provision over the contractual
period. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction
will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Such
revenues include television and radio transmission services, tower site rental to mobile network operators,
installation services, in-building and small cells, network provision, media services, and
machine-to-machine connectivity.

For long-term services contracts revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the contract.
However, if the performance pattern is other than straight line, revenue is recognised as services are
provided, usually on an output or network coverage basis. Such revenues include Smart metering network
build and service operation.

Pre-contract costs incurred in the initial set up phase of a contract are deferred. These costs are then
recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining contractual term, unless the
pattern of service delivery indicates a different profile is appropriate. These costs are directly attributable
to specific contracts, relate to future activity, will generate future economic benefits and are assessed for
recoverability on a regular basis. Costs related to delivering services under long-term contractual
arrangements are expensed as incurred.

_Delivery of engineering projects_

Arqiva provides support to its customers by undertaking various engineering projects.

Revenue from such projects, which are long-term (greater than 12 months) contractual arrangements, are
recognised based on the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is estimated using an
appropriate measure according to the nature of the contract. Profit is recognised, if the final outcome can
be assessed with reasonable certainty, by including revenue and related costs in the income statement as
contract activity progresses.

A loss on a fixed price contract is recognised immediately when it becomes probable that the contract cost
will exceed the total contract revenue.

_Sale of communications equipment_

Revenue from the sale of communications equipment is recognised when the significant risks and rewards
of ownership are transferred to the buyer, which is typically upon delivery and acceptance by the customer.

**Business combinations, including goodwill**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Goodwill is measured as the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree

F-80


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

(if any) less the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is indication of
impairment.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on
a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, on the following bases:

**Asset Description** **Estimated Useful Life**

Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of the licence period (no more than 20 years)
Development costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
Access rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of the agreement (no more than 20 years)
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 10 years

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an
internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

- the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

- how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and
to use or sell the intangible asset; and

- the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure
incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no
internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or
loss in the period in which it is incurred.

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that
are acquired separately.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from
use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit
or loss when the asset is derecognised.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical purchase cost (which includes costs directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition), being fair value for tangible assets acquired on
acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Assets in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, are carried at cost,
less any recognised impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and

F-81


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

direct labour. Labour costs are capitalised within the cost of an asset to the extent that they are directly
attributable to the construction of the asset. The value capitalised captures all elements of employee
benefits as defined by IAS 19.

Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with
the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets,
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than freehold land and
properties under construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line
method, on the following bases:

**Asset Description** **Estimated Useful Life**

Freehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 – 80 years
Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of lease (typically between 20 – 80 years)
Plant and equipment
—Communications infrastructure network . 8 – 100 years
—Network computer equipment . . . . . . . . 3 – 20 years
—Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 5 years

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each
reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their lease term and their expected
useful lives (on the same basis as owned assets).

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal
of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset, and is recognised in the income statement.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any).

Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and
consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual
cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for
which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, is tested for impairment at least annually
and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

F-82


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the impairment relates to goodwill, in which case it cannot
be reversed.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from
the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss, presented as an ‘other gain or
loss’.

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe
established by the market concerned.

The Group’s **_financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair_**
value through profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL’), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. The
Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents:

_Trade receivables_

Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk
of change in value.

The Group’s **_financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial_**
liabilities’ according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

_Borrowings_

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method, and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.

F-83

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Trade other payables_

Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current liabilities,
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current
liabilities.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of
money is material).

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered
from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be
received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

Decommissioning provisions are recognised within provisions for liabilities and charges and included
within property, plant and equipment, where the costs of dismantling assets are considered material. The
amounts recognised within property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the useful economic life of
the asset. The provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where material.

When the probability that the Group will be required to settle an obligation or a reliable estimate cannot
be made of the amount of the obligation the Group discloses a contingent liability in the notes to the
financial information.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross
currency swaps.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered
into and are revalued at fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value of these instruments is
determined from the expected future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The future cash flows
are estimated based on forward (interest/inflation/exchange) rates observable from rates and yield curves
at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates. The difference between the fair value at the
risk-adjusted rate and the fair value at the risk-free rate is used to determine the debit valuation
adjustment and/or credit valuation adjustment to these instruments. The Group does not apply hedge
accounting principles.

A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Otherwise derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. Where derivatives have an
amortising profile, the fair value of the element (i.e. the notional principal) that matures within 12 months
is presented as a current asset or current liability.

**Fair value measurement**

IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of
an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is

F-84


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

determined on such a basis. Exceptions to this principle have been made for leasing transactions that are
within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that are approximations to fair value but are not fair value,
such as value in use in IAS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance
of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the entity can access at the measurement date;

- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

**Retirement benefits**

_Defined contribution schemes_

For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement benefits is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable for the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the statement of financial position.

F-85


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Defined benefit schemes_

Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the
Group, in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and
liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and terms
to the scheme liabilities.

The Plan closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 January 2016.

Prior to closing the scheme to future accrual, the Group presented current and past service costs within
cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 30) in its consolidated income statement. Curtailments
gains and losses are accounted for as a past-service cost.

Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance income (see note 9).

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents
the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is
limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the schemes or
reductions in future contributions to the schemes.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw
the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

_The Group as lessor_

Equipment leased to customers under finance leases is deemed to be sold at normal selling price and this
value is recognised as revenue at the inception of the lease. The associated asset is recognised within cost
of sales at the inception of the lease. Receivables under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due
under these agreements, less finance charges allocated to future periods. Finance lease interest is
recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash
investments.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_The Group as lessee_

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease
obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which
case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs. Contingent
rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating
leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised
as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the
time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**Government grants**

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with
the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the
Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or
otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the consolidated statement of
financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of
the related assets.

**Operating profit and exceptional items**

Operating profit is stated after exceptional impairment and restructuring costs, and after the share of
results of associates but before finance income and finance costs.

Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature or material, either
by magnitude or nature, that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid the
distortion of underlying performance, for example one-off impairments, redundancy programmes,
restructuring and costs related to significant corporate finance. The Directors believe the resulting
EBITDA represents underlying performance, excluding significant one-off and non-recurring events, that
more fairly represents the on-going trading performance of the business. These items are therefore
presented separately on the face of the income statement.

**Foreign currencies**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction,
except in the case of certain financing transactions where hedging arrangements are in place and
transactions are recorded at the contracted rate.

Monetary assets and liabilities denoted in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at
the balance sheet date or the contracted rate if applicable. Any exchange differences arising are taken to
the income statement. Transactions in the income statement of overseas operations are translated using an
average exchange rate.

Exchange differences on translation of overseas branches are recognised through the statement of
comprehensive income.

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

**Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements and those involving estimations that the Directors have made in
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in financial statements.

_Revenue recognition (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_

In applying the Group’s revenue recognition policy, as set out in note 3, judgements are made in respect of
certain areas including:

- determination of distinct contract components and performance obligations;

- measurement of variable consideration;

- determination of fair value of non-cash consideration; and

- the recognition of a significant financing component.

Such judgments are consistently applied across similar contracts and key estimates are regularly monitored
throughout the relevant contractual periods with reference to the stage of completion and any applicable
customer milestone acceptance. This is particularly relevant to the approach for significant engineering
projects which typically contain a programme build phase and a long-term operational phase.

_Deferred tax (critical accounting judgement)_

The largest element of deferred tax that requires judgement relates to tax losses carried forward (see
note 20). Applicable accounting standards permit the recognition of deferred tax assets only to the extent
that future taxable profits will be generated to utilise the tax losses carried forward. The assessment of
future taxable profits involves significant estimation uncertainty, principally relating to an assessment of
management’s projections of future taxable income based on business plans and on-going tax planning
strategies in relation to substantively enacted tax legislation.

_Useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangibles (key source of estimation uncertainty)_

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires estimation. Depreciation or
amortisation is charged to the income statement based upon the useful lives selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will derive benefit from these assets.

The Group manages its property, plant and equipment on a portfolio basis through a central estates team.
This team contains qualified surveyors who have a wealth of experience working for the Group and within
the industry as a whole.

The carrying values of intangibles are disclosed in note 15, and those for property, plant and equipment are
disclosed in note 16.

_Provisions and contingent liabilities (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_

As disclosed in note 26, the Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising from contractual
obligations, restructuring and property remediation plans and decommissioning obligations.

Estimates have been made in respect of the probable future obligations of the Group. These estimates are
reviewed annually to reflect current economic conditions and strategic plans.

Management exercises judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 28)
through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise, and in quantifying the possible
range of financial outcomes.

_Impairment of goodwill (critical accounting judgement and key source of estimation uncertainty)_

The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill is reviewed at each statement of financial position date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment, in compliance with the Group’s accounting

F-88

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

policies. Deciding the recoverable amount of a line of business to which goodwill is attributed involves
management estimates. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the
value in use.

The Group determines these values using methods based on discounted cash flows. These discounted cash
flows are founded on five-year projections built on financial plans approved by the Board. The cash flow
projections take account of past experience, and are based on management’s best estimates of future
developments based on contracted growth and necessary expenditure to maintain the assets required to
generate that expected revenue. Cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using an expected
terminal growth rate.

The key assumptions underlying the changes in value in use involve estimates of the discount rate (with
reference to weighted average costs of capital), projected cash flows and terminal growth rate.

The carrying amount of goodwill at the statement of financial position date is disclosed in note 14.

_Actuarial assumptions used to determine the carrying amount of the Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities (key_
_source of estimation uncertainty)_

The Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities are discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the
end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is required when
setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived. The
most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate bonds,
quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The Group selects these
assumptions in consultation with an external qualified actuary. Additionally, the present value of the
scheme liabilities depend on such factors as the life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of
our current employees and price inflation.

Estimates are used for all of these factors in determining the pension costs and liabilities incorporated in
our financial statements. The assumptions reflect historical experience and our judgement regarding future
expectations. The value of the net pension surplus at 30 June 2017, the key financial assumptions used for
measurement, the sensitivity of the IAS 19 (Revised 2011) pension surplus at 30 June 2017 and of the
income statement charge in the year then ended to changes in these assumptions are disclosed in note 30.

_Fair value measurements and valuation processes (key source of estimation uncertainty)_

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is
available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses estimation techniques in accordance with
the requirements of IFRS 13. This includes the assessment of the fair value adjustments with respect to
credit risk (specifically debit valuation adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities) for which
the Group incorporates market-observable data into its valuation techniques.

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets
and liabilities are disclosed in notes 14 and 25.

The Group derives its revenue from the rendering of services, engineering projects, and the sale of
communications equipment. See note 3 for the accounting policies adopted.

**Segmental reporting**

Information reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) (which is collectively the
Group’s Board of Directors, including the CEO and CFO) for the purposes of resource allocation and the
assessment of segmental performance is focused on the three customer-facing business units, supported by
central corporate functions which are non-revenue generating. The Group’s reportable segments under
IFRS 8 are therefore:

- Terrestrial Broadcast;

- Telecoms & M2M; and

- Satellite and Media.

‘Other’ segment refers to our corporate business unit, which is non-revenue generating.

Information regarding the nature of these business units is contained on pages 13 to 15 within the Strategic
report.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies
described in note 3.

Segmental result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of the reconciling items
above or central administration costs including investment revenue and finance costs, and income tax
expense. This is the measure reported to the Group’s CODM for the purpose of resource allocation and
assessment of segment performance.

1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation’ and includes
add-backs for certain items charged to operating profit that do not reflect the underlying business performance. The table
above reconciles this adjusted profit measure back to operating profit as presented in the income statement.

2 Includes add-backs for certain profit or loss on disposal of other intangibles and property, plant and equipment and includes
deductions for non-interest related finance costs, principally bank charges that are not considered relevant in understanding the
underlying performance of the business.

**7 Exceptional items (Continued)**

Reorganisation and severance expenses include costs relating to delivery of the Group’s FutureFit
programme. This is a transformation programme that will help Arqiva streamline processes, modernise IT
systems and achieve significant cost efficiencies and savings. This includes one-off compensation payments
to align employee Terms and Conditions.

Corporate finance activity costs relate to costs associated with the shareholder strategic review.

Loss on disposal of subsidiary relates to the disposal of Arqiva WiFi Limited, a subsidiary undertaking of
the Group that operated in non-core business areas, specifically certain WiFi contracts.

In November 2016 the Group refinanced its £353.5m term loan with new debt issues that extend the final
maturity date to December 2029. Accordingly certain swap arrangements relating to the former term loan
were closed out and new swap arrangements were entered into to match the maturity profiles of the new
debt.

The Group also disposed of the remainder of its swap options (total notional principal of £353.2m). As a
result, certain charges crystallised in respect of the de-recognition of these instruments at their fair value.
See note 25 for further information.

The expense amounts included within exceptional items above are deductible for the purpose of taxation.
The loss on disposal of subsidiary (see note 29 for further information) is not subject to corporation tax as
a result of the substantial shareholding exemption.

**Total tax charge / (credit) for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **0.1** **(0.1)**

UK Corporation tax is calculated at the weighted average rate of 19.75% (2016: 20.00%) of the estimated
taxable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the
respective jurisdictions.

The charge / (credit) for the year can be reconciled to the loss in the income statement as follows:

**Total tax charge / (credit) for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **0.1** **(0.1)**

Change in unrecognised deferred tax assets includes the changes in the tax losses in the year which have
not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.

The main rate of UK corporation tax decreased from 20% to 19% during the period and a 19.75% blended
tax rate (2016: 20.00%) has therefore been used for the reconciliation of total tax. Finance Act 2016 was
substantively enacted in the period ended 30 June 2017 and further reduced the main rate of corporation
tax from 19% to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020. UK deferred tax has been valued at 17% (2016: 18%)
as this is the rate at which the deferred tax balances are forecast to unwind.

There were no amounts relating to tax recognised in other comprehensive loss.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The CGUs that have associated
goodwill are Terrestrial Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and Satellite & Media. These are the smallest
identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.

The Group disposed of £6.8m of goodwill in relation to its investment in Arqiva WiFi Limited which was
disposed of by the Group on 1 November 2016. See note 29 for further information.

The carrying value of goodwill as at the balance sheet date by the principal CGUs is shown as follows:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that
goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use
calculations (‘VIU’). The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding the discount rates,
growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the year for which management has detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Growth rates are based on internal and external

F-97

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**14 Goodwill (Continued)**

growth forecasts. Changes to cash flows are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in
the market.

_Projected cash flows and the ‘recoverable amount’_

The value in use of each CGU is determined from the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent
financial forecasts approved by the Board for the next five years. They reflect management’s expectations
of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure and working capital based on past experience and future
expectations of performance.

_Discount rate_

The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived using the capital asset pricing
model for comparable businesses. The assumptions used are benchmarked to externally available data.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 8.0% (2016: 7.7%).

_Terminal growth rates_

The terminal growth rate is determined based on the long-term growth rates of the regions in which the
CGU operates (2017: 1.8%; 2016: 2.1%). The growth rate has been benchmarked against externally
available data. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

_Sensitivities_

There is significant headroom in all CGUs. No reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would
cause the carrying amount of the goodwill by CGU to exceed the recoverable amount based upon the VIU.

Freehold land included above but not depreciated amounts to £180.0m (2016: £180.0m).

The Group’s current and non-current assets have been pledged as security under the terms of the Group’s
external debt facilities (see note 23). In addition, the Group’s obligations under finance leases (see
note 24) are secured by the lessors’ title of the leased assets, which have a carrying amount of
£5.8m (2016: £6.2m) included within leasehold buildings.

During the year, £nil (2016: £1.7m) of interest was capitalised, as set out in note 10. The carrying value of
capitalised interest included within property, plant and equipment was £14.8m (2016: £20.5m).

At 30 June 2017, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property,
plant and equipment amounting to £49.1m (2016: £22.4m)—see note 28 for further details.

Included within plant and equipment are telecommunications assets initially recognised on a fair value
basis at a value of £30.9m (2016: £20.6m) and accumulated depreciation of £6.1m (2016: £3.6m). Fair value
was determined using observable inputs (fair value hierarchy level 2).

Share of results of associates and joint ventures was £0.3m (2016: £0.1m) for the year with the interest in
associates and joint ventures being £5.1m (2016: £4.8m).

There are no other associates or joint ventures that are considered material, either individually or in
aggregate, to the Group’s position or performance.

The Directors consider the carrying value of the Group’s investments on an annual basis, or more
frequently should indicators arise, and believe that the carrying values of the investments are supported by
the underlying trade and net assets.

Transactions with associates and joint ventures in the year are disclosed in note 31.

The Group’s policy is to recommend providing for trade receivables outstanding for more than 30 days
beyond the agreed terms, or where the business environment indicates a specific risk. Management will
make an assessment of the level of provision based on the Group policy. Adjustments to the calculated
level of provision will be made accordingly.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Before accepting
any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s
credit quality. For further information on how the Group manages credit risk see note 25.

**19 Finance lease receivables (Continued)**

The Group entered into finance leasing arrangements for certain sites. The average outstanding term of
finance leases entered in to is 6.8 years at 30 June 2017 (2016: 7.8 years).

**20 Deferred tax**

The balance of deferred tax recognised at 30 June 2017 is £nil (2016: £nil). The movement in deferred
income tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances
within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows:

**Derivative**

**Deferred tax assets** **depreciation** **instruments** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m**

Deferred tax assets are not recognised unless it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits against
which they will be realised. Due to the level of tax deductible interest and capital allowances available, the
Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £258.2m (2016: £205.4m). This is in respect of tax losses
of £53.7m (2016: £39.9m), derivative financial instruments £166.3m (2016: £163.8m), fixed asset temporary
differences £38.1m (2016: £1.7m) and other temporary differences £0.2m (2016: £nil). These deferred tax
assets may be carried forward indefinitely.

This value has been calculated based on the UK corporation tax rate of 17.0% (2016: 18.0%); the rate
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £nil (2016: £nil) relating to the
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timings of the reversal of
these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

In the March 2016 budget the UK Government announced that it planned to introduce new rules to
restrict the deductibility of net interest costs from 1 April 2017. The proposed changes had not been
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore their effects are not included in the financial
statements. However, it remains the UK Government’s stated intention that the rules will have
retrospective effect from 1 April 2017.

Subject to other recognition criteria and based on published draft legislation setting out these new rules, it
is likely that the overall effect of the changes, if they had been substantively enacted by the balance sheet
date, would have been to recognise certain additional deferred tax assets primarily in relation to financial
instruments and fixed asset temporary differences.

- Senior debt includes £nil (2016: £120.0m) drawn down on the capital expenditure facility.

The fair value of the quoted senior bonds based upon observable market prices (fair value hierarchy
level 1) was £1,020.4m (2016: £996.0m) whilst their carrying value was £914.0m (2016: £914.0m).

The fair value of the quoted junior bonds based upon observable market prices (fair value hierarchy
level 1) was £640.4m (2016: £642.1m) whilst their carrying value was £600.0m (2016: £600.0m).

The fair value of fixed rate privately placed senior debt determined from observable market prices for
quoted instruments as a proxy measure (fair value hierarchy level 2) was £476.0m (2016: £458.0m) whilst
their carrying value was £438.1m (2016: £429.5m).

The directors consider the fair value of all other un-quoted borrowings to be a close approximate to their
carrying amount.

The weighted average interest rate of borrowings is 7.94% (2016: 7.86%).

**Bank loans form part of the Group’s senior debt. Other loans comprise the Group’s senior bonds and notes**
and junior bonds.

In November 2016, the Group completed the refinancing of all of the bank facilities that were due to
mature in 2018, namely the £353.5m term bank loan and working capital and capex facilities. These were
replaced with a new bank term loan with an expected maturity of June 2020, a £218.5m sterling
denominated floating rate amortising US private placement with a maturity date of December 2029 and
new working capital and capital expenditure facilities with an expected maturity of March 2021. In
addition, the Group replaced the existing £200m liquidity facility with a new £250m facility that supports
the payment of scheduled interest and principal.

**23 Borrowings (Continued)**

The remaining senior notes relate to a number of US private placement issues in both sterling and US
dollars with fixed and floating interest rates. The Group has £518.5m of sterling denominated floating rate
US private placements that are amortising in nature with repayments due between December 2018 and
December 2029. These instruments have a margin over LIBOR of between 210 and 220 bps. In addition,
the Group has issued £398.5m of fixed rate US private placements in sterling and US dollar denominated
notes. These notes have fixed interest rates which range between 4.101% and 4.420% and have amortising
repayment profiles commencing December 2018 with a final maturity date of June 2025. Arqiva PP
Financing Plc (‘APPF’) is the issuer of all of the Group’s private placement notes.

All of the above financing instruments have covenants attached, principally an interest cover ratio and a
debt leverage ratio, and benefit from security over substantially all of the Group’s assets under a Whole
Business Securitisation structure. The Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

**Junior bonds of £600.0m represent amounts raised from the issuance of notes by Arqiva Broadcast**
Finance Plc. These notes have a fixed interest rate of 9.5% and are repayable in March 2020. These notes
are listed on the Luxembourg Market and have interest cover and debt leverage covenants attached. The
Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

In December 2013, the Group established facilities in Arqiva Smart Financing Limited (an Arqiva
company that sits outside the main WBS financing group) that support the Group’s smart energy metering
contracts by financing the purchase of communication hubs. This £30m facility matures in Jun 2028 and
£0.1m was drawn at the end of June 2017 (June 2016: £nil). There is also an associated £1.6m fee facility
that matures by June 2019 which was £1.1m drawn as at June 2017 (June 2016: £0.9m). These loans have
floating rates of interest with margins ranging from LIBOR + 1.20% to 2.50%.

The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

The Group’s obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

**25 Financial instruments and risk management**

**Capital risk management**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going
concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (as set out in note 27; see note 21 for cash and cash
equivalents and note 23 for borrowings) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital and share
premium, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests).

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

**Significant accounting policies**

Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis
of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset and
financial liability are disclosed in full in note 3.

The Group’s derivatives (i.e. interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps) are measured on a fair value
through profit and loss basis. Whilst the Group’s derivatives act as an effective hedge in economic terms,
hedge accounting principles are not applied. This means that the Group’s derivatives are recognised at
their risk-adjusted fair value (i.e. risk-adjusted Mark-to-Market value) at the date they are entered into
and are revalued at each balance sheet date, with gains and losses being reported separately in the income
statement within ‘other gains and losses’. Net amounts paid in the year (excluding termination amounts)
on interest rate swaps (together with similar amounts under the cross currency and index linked swaps) are
reported as a component of net bank and other loan interest within finance costs.

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and
international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the
Group using financial instruments wherever it is appropriate to do so. The treasury function reports
directly into the Chief Financial Officer and the Group’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, an
independent function with a scope that includes monitoring the risks and policies implemented to mitigate
risk exposures. The main risks addressed by financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign
currency exchange risk. The Group’s policies in respect of these risks remain unchanged throughout the
year.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign
currency and interest rate risk, including:

- Interest rate swaps, including inflation-linked interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of movement in
interest rates;

- Cross-currency swaps to mitigate the risk of currency exposures on foreign denominated borrowings;
and

- Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage exchange risks arising from transactional foreign
exchange exposures.

The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,
for speculative purposes.

**Foreign currency risk management**

The Group principally operates from UK sites and predominantly in the UK market, but has some
overseas subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. While some customer and
supplier contracts are denominated in other currencies (mainly US dollars (‘USD’) and Euro), the majority
of the Group’s revenue and costs are Sterling based and accordingly exposure to foreign exchange risk is
limited.

Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation
risk:

**_Transactional risk:_** The Group’s policy is to hedge material transactional currency exposures via the use of
forward foreign exchange contracts. The measurement and control of this risk is monitored on a
Group-wide basis.

**_Translation risk:_** The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting
policy in note 3. Given the Group predominantly operates in the UK, there is a relatively small exposure
with overseas entities accounting for only 0.2% (2016: 0.5%) of operating profit and 0.1% (2016: 0.1%) of
total assets for the Group.

The Sterling equivalents of the carrying amounts of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary

- refers to Singapore dollar, being the most frequently transacted currency within ‘other monetary assets and liabilities’.

Foreign currency denominated cash balances have a weighted average interest rate of 0.0% (2016: 0.0%).

During the year cross currency swaps (nominal value USD 358.0m) were used to fix the exchange rate to
$1.52/£1 in relation to US dollar-denominated senior notes (nominal value USD 358.0m). This provides an
effective economic hedge of the foreign currency impact on the Sterling cost of future interest and capital
repayment obligations.

After taking into account our hedging activities, management does not consider there to be a material
residual exposure to exchange rates. Accordingly no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

**Interest rate risk management**

The Group has variable rate bank and US private placement debt and uses interest rate swaps (‘IRS’) and
inflation-linked swaps (‘ILS’) to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates. The Group maintains a hedging
policy to manage interest rate risk and to ensure the certainty of future interest cash flows. The Group has
fixed rate hedging, split between IRS and ILS. IRS convert variable rate interest costs to fixed rate interest
costs while ILS convert fixed or variable rate interest costs to RPI-linked costs, which fluctuate in line with
the RPI index as do a portion of the Group’s revenue contracts. These swaps are entered into on terms
(including maturity) that mirror the debt instrument they hedge, and therefore act as an effective economic
hedge.

As the Group uses hedging to maintain fixed interest rates on all of its material borrowings (excluding
revolving facilities), there is minimal exposure on the interest expense to interest rate movements. A rise or
fall in interest rates would therefore not materially impact the interest expense payable by the Group.

**Liquidity risk management**

To ensure it has sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth, the Group
maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast requirements. The
Group carefully manages the counterparty credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments
with balances currently spread across a range of major financial institutions, which have satisfactory credit
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The levels of credit risk are monitored through the
Group’s ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of counterparty credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level and term for deposits with any single
counterparty.

The following tables set out the maturity profile of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and
derivative financial liabilities. The amounts presented in respect of the non-derivative financial liabilities

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

When debt has been refinanced the Group has also restructured the associated swaps to reflect the new
maturity profile.

**Credit risk management**

The Group is exposed to credit risk on customer receivables, which is managed through credit-checking
procedures prior to taking on new customers and higher risk customers paying in advance of services being
provided. Performance is closely monitored to ensure agreed service levels are maintained, reducing the
level of queried payments and mitigating the risk of uncollectable debts.

**Financial instruments**

With the exception of derivative financial instruments (which are recognised and measured at fair value
through profit and loss) the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and measured
following the loans and receivables recognition category.

The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 30 June 2017 was 6.10% (2016:
6.10%) and the weighted average period of funding was 5.9 years (2016: 6.8 years).

Within the Group’s financial liabilities were borrowings of £2,862.9m (2016: £3,150.2m) (see note 23),
which includes £1,118.5m (2016: £1,023.5m) with floating rate interest and the remainder with fixed rate
interest (prior to the hedging arrangements described previously).

The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents of £35.6m (2016: £39.3m) and loans and
receivables of £225.3m (2016: £220.0m) as presented in notes 21 and 18 respectively.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group seeks to manage the exposures of its debt payment obligations through a combination of
indexed linked, interest rate and cross currency swaps.

In conjunction with the November 2016 refinancing (see note 23), the Group restructured the derivatives
held by Arqiva Senior Finance Limited (‘ASFL’). £353.2m notional value of swap options were fully closed
out for cash proceeds of £3.2m and £353.2m of notional value of interest rate swaps were terminated for a
cash payment of £163.3m. Simultaneously, AF1 entered into new interest rate swap contracts with a
notional amount of £353.5m to hedge the interest obligations of the newly established bank term loan and
US private placement notes which resulted in a premium of £127.2m being received. These amendments to
the derivative portfolio resulted in a £15.4m exceptional loss being recognised in other gains and losses
(see note 11). As part of these amendments, the mandatory break clauses were removed.

The above amendments were completed in order to comply with the covenants under its WBS platform
and the Group’s overall strategy to ensure that a majority of interest exposures are hedged.

At the year end, the Group held interest rate swaps with notional amounts of £1,023.5m which hedge the
interest obligations of the Group’s floating rate debt. The average fixed rate on these instruments is 7.02%.
The swap contracts have termination dates that match the maturities of the underlying floating rate debt
instruments (see note 23).

The Group has also entered into index linked swaps (notional amounts of £1,312.5m) where the Group
receives floating and pays fixed interest obligations to an average rate of 2.939% indexed with RPI. The
notional amounts of these swaps increase with RPI and these accretion amounts are cash settled annually,
most recently in June 2017 (£53.4m). All of these instruments have a maturity date of April 2027; however
£235.0m of these have a mandatory break clause in 2023. These instruments were established to hedge the
Group’s fixed rate debt (namely fixed rate sterling bonds and the fixed rate US Private Placement issues)
and in order to ensure that the cash flow characteristics align with these instruments, the Group has
entered into £1,312.5m of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps to match the cash flows on both the
fixed rate debt instruments and the index linked swaps set out above.

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

The Group also holds USD 358.0m of cross-currency swaps to fix the Sterling cost of future interest and
capital repayment obligations relating to the US dollar denominated private placement issue at an
exchange rate of 1.52.

The fair value of the interest rate, inflation and cross currency swaps at 30 June 2017 is a liability of
£1,179.7m (2016: £1,157.2m). This fair value is calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate.

Following their close-out in November 2016, the Group no longer holds any swap options (2016: £353.2m
notional).

Where possible, the Group seeks to match the maturity of any derivative contracts with that of debt
instruments that it has issued. In some of the Group’s derivative instruments, break clauses have been
included to both match underlying facility maturities and to optimise the availability and cost of hedging
lines with the Group’s derivative counterparties.

**Fair value hierarchy**

Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into
levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices); and

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for
the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Interest rate swaps, inflation rate swaps, swap options and cross-currency swaps (as disclosed above) are all
classed as level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. In each case the items are valued based upon discounted cash
flow. Future cash flows are estimated based on forward (interest/inflation/exchange) rates observable from
rates and yield curves at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates, discounted at a risk-adjusted
rate.

The onerous contracts provision relates to supplier contracts where the costs are expected to exceed the
benefits, and onerous lease contracts where the buildings are empty but lease costs are being incurred. The
provision is expected to be utilised over the next five years.

Provisions are made for decommissioning and asset at risk costs where the Group has an obligation to
restore sites and the cost of restoration is not recoverable from third parties. The provision is in relation to
assets of which the remaining useful economic life ranges up to 18 years.

The restructuring provision relates to the costs of exceptional activities to reorganise the Group through its
FutureFit programme which will be utilised during the next financial year.

The remediation provision represents the cost of works identified as being required across a number of the
Group’s sites and is expected to be utilised over the next one to ten years.

Other provisions represent a variety of smaller items which are expected to be utilised over the next one to
three years.

**29 Disposal of business (Continued)**

On 11 December 2015 the Group sold 100% interest in the ordinary share capital of NWP Street Limited,
a subsidiary undertaking. The profit on disposal recognised in other gains and losses as an exceptional item
was £14.4m at 30 June 2016. The total consideration was £16.4m, satisfied by cash and cash equivalents.

**30 Retirement benefits**

**Defined contribution scheme**

Arqiva Limited has operated a Defined Contribution Scheme during the year, for those employees who are
not members of the Group’s Defined Benefit Plan. Contributions payable in respect of this Scheme for the
year were £10.7m (2016: £7.0m). The assets of the Scheme are held outside of the Group.

An amount of £0.7m (2016: £0.6m) is included in accruals being the outstanding contributions to the
Defined Contribution Scheme.

**Defined benefit plan**

In the year to 30 June 2017, the Group operated one Defined Benefit Plan, sponsored by Arqiva Limited.
The Defined Benefit Plan is administered by a separate entity that is legally separated from the Group,
and therefore the Plan assets are held separately from those of Arqiva Limited. The trustees of the Plan
are required by law to act in the interests of the Plan and of all relevant stakeholders in the Plan. The
trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the Plan assets.

The Plan typically exposes the Group to risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity risk.

**Investment risk . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability for IAS19 purposes is
calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality
corporate bond yields, which is different to how the Plan assets are invested.
Currently the Plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities, debt
instruments and real estate. Due to the long-term nature of the Plan liabilities,
the trustees of the Plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable portion of the
Plan assets should be invested in equity securities to leverage the expected return
generated by the Plan assets.

**Interest risk . . . . . . .** A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the valuation of the Plan’s
IAS19 liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the
Plan’s corporate bond investments.

**Longevity risk . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference
to a best estimate of the mortality of Plan participants both during and after their
retirement. An increase in the life expectancy of the Plan participants will
increase the Plan’s assessed liability.

**Salary risk . . . . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by reference
to the future salaries of Plan participants. As such, an increase in the salary of the
Plan participants will increase the Plan’s liability.

The Plan closed to the future accrual of benefits on 31 January 2016. The weighted average duration of the
expected benefit payments from the Plan is around 21 years.

The most recent triennial actuarial funding valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the
defined benefit liability was carried out at 30 June 2014 by an independent firm of consulting actuaries.
The present value of the IAS19 defined benefit liability, and the related current service cost and past
service cost, have been measured using the projected unit credit method based on roll-forward updates to
the triennial valuation figures.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**30 Retirement benefits (Continued)**

The Plan includes holdings of gilts and corporate bonds, which are intended to partially hedge the financial
risk from liability valuation movements associated with changes in gilt and corporate bond yields. IAS19
liability movements from changes in the discount rate will also be partially hedged by the Plan’s corporate
bond holding.

No amounts within the fair value of the Plan assets are in respect of the Group’s own financial instruments
or any property occupied by, or assets used by, the Group.

Following completion of the latest funding valuation as at 30 June 2014, Arqiva Limited has agreed to pay
deficit contributions of £2.5m per annum to 31 July 2018, and then payments of £3.3m per annum to July
2020. The Group anticipates that cash contributions to the defined benefit plan for the year ending 30 June
2018 will be £5.0m.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The assumptions considered to be the most significant are the discount rate adopted, inflation represented
by RPI, and the longevity assumptions.

The sensitivity of the 2017 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **RPI movement** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **movement of 0.1%** **of 0.1%** **movement of +1 year**

Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £5.1m £5.2m £7.1m

The sensitivity of the 2016 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **RPI movement** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **movement of 0.1%** **of 0.1%** **movement of +1 year**

Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £4.7m £4.8m £5.6m

This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as
it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.

**31 Related party transactions**

Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been
eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. Transactions with the Group’s pension
scheme are disclosed in note 30. Transactions between the Group and its associates, joint ventures and

The disclosure of transactions with related parties reflects the periods in which the related party
relationships exist. The disclosure of amounts outstanding to/from related parties at the reporting date
reflects related party relationships at that date.

**Independent Auditors’ report to the Members of Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited**

**Report on the audit of the financial statements**

**Opinion**

In our opinion:

- Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited’s Group financial statements and Company financial statements (the
‘‘financial statements’’) give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s
affairs as at 30 June 2018 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

- the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising
FRS 101 ‘‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’’, and applicable law); and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

We have audited the Group and Company financial statements (together the ‘financial statements’),
included within the Annual Report, which comprise: the Consolidated statement of financial position and
the Company statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018; the Consolidated income statement, the
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated
statement of changes in equity and the Company statement of changes in equity for the year then ended;
and the notes to the financial statements, which include a description of the significant accounting policies.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (‘‘ISAs (UK)’’) and
applicable law. Our responsibilities under ISAs (UK) are further described in the Auditors’ responsibilities
for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Independence**

We remained independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to
our audit of the financial statements in the UK, which includes the FRC’s Ethical Standards, applicable to
listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

**_The scope of our audit_**



- Overall Group materiality: £16.5m (2017: £15.5m)—Group financial
statements.

- Based on 5% of profit before interest, tax, exceptional items and other gains
and losses.

- Overall Company materiality: £44.4m (2017: £43.4m)—Company financial
statements

- Based on 1% of total assets.

- For the Group financial statements we performed an audit of the complete
financial information of 8 reporting units.

- The audit work performed gave us coverage of 91% of revenue and 97% of

profit before interest, tax, other gains and losses and exceptional items.

- All entities have been audited by the Group team and hence no component
auditor has been involved in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements.

- Revenue and profit recognition on complex contracts (Group).

- Accruals and provisions, including amounts relating to infrastructure and
bonuses and decommissioning of sites (Group).

- Valuation of financial instruments (Group).

- Classification of exceptional items (Group).

- Impairment of intangible assets and goodwill (Group) and investments in
subsidiaries (Company only).

- Recognition of deferred tax asset (Group).


As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement
in the financial statements. In particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for
example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering
future events that are inherently uncertain.

As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including
testing journals and evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk
of material misstatement due to fraud.

**_Key audit matters_**

Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors’ professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks
of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which
had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing
the efforts of the engagement team.

These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in
the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we
do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our
audit.

We assessed whether the revenue recognised on the
contracts was in line with the Group accounting
policies and IAS 18.

Our testing did not identify any material differences
in relation to revenue and profit recognition on
these complex contracts.

to the long term plan which has been approved by
the board.

any material differences or where the rationale for

As a result of our work performed no material
differences were noted in respect of the amount of
deferred tax asset recognised in the financial
statements at 30 June 2018.

**_How we tailored the audit scope_**

We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion
on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group and the Company,
the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which they operate.

Arqiva Group Limited’s business is carried out through two principal trading subsidiaries, aligned into
three customer-facing business units; Terrestrial Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and Satellite and Media,
supported by the Group’s corporate functions. In addition there are a number of entities which provide
financing to the operations.

**_Materiality_**

The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative
thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the
scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial
statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in
aggregate on the financial statements as a whole.

Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as
follows:

**Group financial statements** **Company financial statements**

**_Overall materiality_** £16.5m (2017: £15.5m). £44.4m (2017: £43.4m).

**_How we determined_** 5% of profit before interest, tax, 1% of total assets.

generally accepted auditing benchmark.

F-126


-----

For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall
Group materiality. The range of materiality allocated across components between £1m and £15.7m.
Certain components were audited to a local statutory audit materiality that was also less than our overall
Group materiality.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our
audit above £0.75m (Group audit) (2017: £0.5m) and £0.75m (Company audit) (2017: £0.5m) as well as
misstatements below those amounts that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

Conclusions relating to going concern

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which ISAs (UK) require us to
report to you when:

- the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is not appropriate; or

- the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that
may cast significant doubt about the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue to adopt the going
concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial
statements are authorised for issue.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as
to the Group’s and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Reporting on other information**

The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial
statements and our auditors’ report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information. Our
opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion or, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, any form of
assurance thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information
and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial
statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we
identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform
procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material
misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to
report based on these responsibilities.

With respect to the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report we also considered whether the disclosures
required by the UK Companies Act 2006 have been included.

Based on the responsibilities described above and our work undertaken in the course of the audit, ISAs
(UK) require us also to report certain opinions and matters as described below.

**Strategic Report and Directors’ Report**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit, the information given in the
Strategic Report and Directors’ Report for the year ended 30 June 2018 is consistent with the financial
statements and has been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

In light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and Company and their environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we did not identify any material misstatements in the Strategic Report and
Directors’ Report.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**Responsibilities of the directors for the financial statements**

As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities set out on page 55, the directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the applicable framework
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. The directors are also responsible for such

F-127

internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern
and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or
the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the
basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the
FRC’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditors’
report.

**Use of this report**

This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not,
in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.

**Other required reporting**

Companies Act 2006 exception reporting

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- the Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**2 Adoption of new and revised Standards (Continued)**

**Impact Assessment of new Standards**

_IFRS 9 Financial Instruments_

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will be effective for the Group for the year ended 30 June 2019. The new
standard addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial
liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and debt modifications and a new impairment model
for financial assets.

The majority of the Groups assets and liabilities are currently classified at fair value through profit or loss
or amortised cost and hence there is no expected change to the accounting treatment of these instruments.
The changes to debt modifications will result in any changes to debt that do not result in the full
extinguishment of the instrument needing to be fair valued based on the effective interest rate of the new
instrument and a gain or loss to the carrying value recognised in other gains and losses. Management have
performed an impact assessment of previous debt refinancing for retrospective application of the standard
and do not expect these changes to have a material impact on the financial statements.

The new impairment model under IFRS 9, requires the recognition of impairment provisions against
financial assets based on an expected credit loss model rather than incurred credit losses as required under
the current standard. Based on the impact assessments undertaken by the Group to date, there is not
currently expected to be a material impact on the loss allowance recognised by the Group. The new
standard will also introduce additional disclosure requirements for the Group.

_IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers_

IFRS 15 is effective for periods beginning from 1 January 2018 and is mandatory for the Group to adopt
the standard for its year ended 30 June 2019. Comparative information in the 30 June 2019 financial
statements will be restated to appropriately present the new standards and impact on initial recognition
will be recognised through retained earnings. The new standard provides a more prescriptive framework
toward revenue recognition and centres around five key revenue recognition steps:

1. Identify the contract with the customer;

2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract;

3. Determine the transaction price;

4. Allocation of the contract price to the performance obligations; and

5. Recognise revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.

Whilst these concepts are not new, the standard includes several clarifications to the interpretations of
existing standards, focussing on the transfer of control of goods and services rather than the transfer of
risks and rewards. Management have performed an impact assessment on the adoption of IFRS 15. The
expected impact to the financials is based on performance criteria of specific contracts and the timing of
revenue recognition. The impact assessment on the financial statements includes a £10.8m reduction in
retained earnings on transition, with an immaterial change in annual revenues. IFRS 15 also includes
additional disclosure requirements for the annual financial statements, both qualitative and quantitative in
nature.

_IFRS 16 Leases_

IFRS 16 Leases, is effective for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and therefore is
expected to have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group for the year ending 30 June
2020. This is primarily through the recognition of the Group’s operating leases on the balance sheet and
reclassification of costs in the income statement leading to an increase in EBITDA.

Further details of the Group’s operating lease commitments are shown in note 28. It is not practicable to
provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of this standard until a more detailed review has been
completed. A more detailed impact assessment is expected to be provided in the Group financial
statements for the year ended 30 June 2019.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies**

**Basis of preparation**

The financial framework which now applies to entities preparing financial statements in accordance with
legislation, regulation or accounting standards applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland is
FRS 100, Application of Financial Reporting Requirements, which was issued in November 2012.

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to
companies applying IFRS and in accordance with IFRS Interpretations Committee interpretations.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the valuation of
financial instruments that are measured at fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in
the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given
in exchange for goods and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. These
policies have been applied consistently across the comparative financial periods included within these
financial statements.

The Company’s financial statements have been prepared under FRS 101 and are included in this report—
see page 124.

**Basis of consolidation**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities
controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries, together the Group) made up to 30 June 2018.

Control is achieved when the Company:

- has demonstrable power over the relevant activities of the investee;

- is exposed, or has rights, to variable return from its involvement with the investee; and

- has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.

The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that
there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or
disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date the Company
gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.

Intra-group profits have been eliminated. Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the
Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts
significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. Where the Group has an investment that has
joint control, this is treated as a joint venture. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the
equity method of accounting in accordance with IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’.

**Going concern**

Historically the Group has reported losses and had a significant net liability position on the Statement of
Financial Position, caused primarily by ongoing financing costs. However, the Group has continued to
generate cashflows over and above the financing costs.

The Group meets its day-to-day working capital and financing requirements through the net cash
generated from its operations. The Group has access to sufficient financial resources which, together with
internally generated cash flows, will continue to provide sufficient sources of liquidity to fund its current
operations, including its contractual and commercial commitments as set out in note 28. In addition,
forecast covenant compliance remains strong. For this reason the Directors are confident that the Group
has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing these financial statements.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

**Segmental reporting**

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief
operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for the allocation of
resources and assessment of performance of the operating segments, has been identified as collectively the
Board of Directors, which includes the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents the gross inflow of economic benefit for services provided utilising Arqiva’s
communications infrastructure, completion of significant engineering projects and the sale of
communications equipment. Revenue is stated net of value added tax. Revenue is measured at the fair
value of the consideration received or receivable.

Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more elements that are separable and have value to a
customer on a standalone basis, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
The total contract consideration is allocated between the separate elements on the basis of relative fair
value and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are applied to each element. Likewise where
elements of a contract, or multiple contracts, are so intrinsically linked that it is necessary to consider the
elements on a bundled basis revenue is recognised in respect of the bundled contractual obligations taken
as a whole.

Cash received or invoices raised in advance is taken to deferred income and recognised as revenue when
the services are provided. Where consideration received in advance is discounted, reflecting a significant
financing component, it is reflected within revenue and interest payable and similar charges on a gross
basis. Revenue recognised in advance of cash being received or an invoice being raised is recognised as
accrued income.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue from the rendering of services is recognised in line with the service provision over the contractual
period. Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction
will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue and the associated costs can be measured reliably. Such
revenues include television and radio transmission services, tower site rental to mobile network operators,
installation services, in-building and small cells, network provision, media services, and
machine-to-machine connectivity.

For long-term services contracts revenue is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the contract.
However, if the performance pattern is other than straight line, revenue is recognised as services are
provided, usually on an output or network coverage basis. Such revenues include Smart metering network
build and service operation.

Pre-contract costs incurred in the initial set up phase of a contract are deferred. These costs are then
recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the remaining contractual term, unless the
pattern of service delivery indicates a different profile is appropriate. These costs are directly attributable
to specific contracts, relate to future activity, will generate future economic benefits and are assessed for
recoverability on a regular basis. Costs related to delivering services under long-term contractual
arrangements are expensed as incurred.

_Delivery of engineering projects_

Arqiva provides support to its customers by undertaking various engineering projects.

Revenue from such projects, which are long-term (greater than 12 months) contractual arrangements, are
recognised based on the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is estimated using an
appropriate measure according to the nature of the contract. Profit is recognised, if the final outcome can
be assessed with reasonable certainty, by including revenue and related costs in the income statement as
contract activity progresses.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

A loss on a fixed price contract is recognised immediately when it becomes probable that the contract cost
will exceed the total contract revenue.

_Sale of communications equipment_

Revenue from the sale of communications equipment is recognised when the significant risks and rewards
of ownership are transferred to the buyer, which is typically upon delivery and acceptance by the customer.

**Business combinations, including goodwill**

Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The
consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the
sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group
to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interest issued by the Group in exchange for control of
the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

Goodwill is measured as the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling
interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree
(if any) less the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed.

Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is indication of
impairment.

On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on
a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, on the following bases:

**Asset Description** **Estimated Useful Life**

Licences . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of the licence period (no more than 20 years)
Development costs . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10 years
Access rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of the agreement (no more than 20 years)
Software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 – 10 years

Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.

An internally-generated intangible asset arising from development (or from the development phase of an
internal project) is recognised if, and only if, all of the following conditions have been demonstrated:

- the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;

- the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it;

- the ability to use or sell the intangible asset;

- how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits;

- the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and
to use or sell the intangible asset; and

- the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its
development.

The amount initially recognised for internally-generated intangible assets is the sum of the expenditure
incurred from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria listed above. Where no
internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised in profit or
loss in the period in which it is incurred.

F-138

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Subsequent to initial recognition, internally-generated intangible assets are reported at cost less
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that
are acquired separately.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from
use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset, measured as the
difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit
or loss when the asset is derecognised.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical purchase cost (which includes costs directly
attributable to bringing the assets into working condition), being fair value for tangible assets acquired on
acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.

Assets in the course of construction for production, supply or administrative purposes, are carried at cost,
less any recognised impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and
direct labour. Labour costs are capitalised within the cost of an asset to the extent that they are directly
attributable to the construction of the asset. The value capitalised captures all elements of employee
benefits as defined by IAS 19.

Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with
the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets,
commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.

Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets (other than freehold land and
properties under construction) less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line
method, on the following bases:

**Asset Description** **Estimated Useful Life**

Freehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 – 80 years
Leasehold buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Length of lease (typically between 20 – 80 years)
Plant and equipment
—Communications infrastructure network . 8 – 100 years
—Network computer equipment . . . . . . . . 3 – 20 years
—Motor vehicles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 – 5 years

The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each
reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.

Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their lease term and their expected
useful lives (on the same basis as owned assets).

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic
benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The gain or loss arising on the disposal
of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the
asset, and is recognised in the income statement.

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

At each reporting period date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets
to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the
impairment loss (if any).

Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates
the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and
consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual
cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for
which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

F-139


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, is tested for impairment at least annually
and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. In assessing value in use,
the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying
amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating
unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying
amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss
been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is
recognised immediately in profit or loss unless the impairment relates to goodwill, in which case it cannot
be reversed.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group’s statement of financial position when
the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are
directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than
financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from
the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair
value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in profit or loss, presented as an ‘other gain or
loss’.

All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a
financial asset is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe
established by the market concerned.

The Group’s **_financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets ‘at fair_**
value through profit or loss’ (‘FVTPL’), ‘held-to-maturity’ investments, ‘available-for-sale’ (AFS) financial
assets and ‘loans and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial
assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not
quoted in an active market. They are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at
amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current assets, except for
maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current assets. The
Group’s loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents:

_Trade receivables_

Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.

_Contract receivables_

Contract receivables are amounts owed for future services from signed contracts. Revenue is measured at
the amount receivable under the contract. It is discounted to present value if deferred payments have been
agreed and the impact of discounting is material.

F-140

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid
investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk
of change in value.

The Group’s **_financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ or ‘other financial_**
liabilities’ according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

_Borrowings_

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption, and direct issue costs are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method, and are
added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in
which they arise.

_Trade other payables_

Trade and other payables are not interest bearing and are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are included in current liabilities,
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the reporting date, which are classified as non-current
liabilities.

_Provisions_

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a
past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation.

The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the
present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding
the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present
obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (when the effect of the time value of
money is material).

When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered
from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be
received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.

Decommissioning provisions are recognised within provisions for liabilities and charges and included
within property, plant and equipment, where the costs of dismantling assets are considered material. The
amounts recognised within property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the useful economic life of
the asset. The provisions are discounted to reflect the time value of money where material.

When the probability that the Group will be required to settle an obligation or a reliable estimate cannot
be made of the amount of the obligation the Group discloses a contingent liability in the notes to the
financial information.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross
currency swaps.

Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contract is entered
into and are revalued at fair value at each balance sheet date. The fair value of these instruments is
determined from the expected future cash flows discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The future cash flows
are estimated based on forward (interest/inflation/exchange) rates observable from rates and yield curves
at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates. The difference between the fair value at the
risk-adjusted rate and the fair value at the risk-free rate is used to determine the debit valuation

F-141


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

adjustment and/or credit valuation adjustment to these instruments. The Group does not apply hedge
accounting principles.

A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the
instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Otherwise derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities. Where derivatives have an
amortising profile, the fair value of the element (i.e. the notional principal) that matures within 12 months
is presented as a current asset or current liability.

**Fair value measurement**

IFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that
price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of
an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market
participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the
measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is
determined on such a basis. Exceptions to this principle have been made for leasing transactions that are
within the scope of IAS 17, and measurements that are approximations to fair value but are not fair value,
such as value in use in IAS 36.

In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3
based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance
of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:

- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that
the entity can access at the measurement date;

- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

**Taxation**

The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.

_Current tax_

The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as
reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or
deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s
liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the
balance sheet date.

_Deferred tax_

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities in the financial information and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax
liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible
temporary differences can be utilised.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the
extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the
asset to be recovered.

Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is
settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted

F-142


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it
relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also
dealt with in other comprehensive income.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

**Retirement benefits**

_Defined contribution schemes_

For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the income statement in respect of pension costs
and other post-retirement benefits is the contribution payable in the year. Differences between
contributions payable for the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or
prepayments in the statement of financial position.

_Defined benefit schemes_

Defined benefit schemes are funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the
Group, in separate trustee administered funds. Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and
liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate
equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and terms
to the scheme liabilities.

The Plan closed to future accrual of benefits on 31 January 2016.

Prior to closing the scheme to future accrual, the Group presented current and past service costs within
cost of sales and administrative expenses (see note 30) in its consolidated income statement. Curtailments
gains and losses are accounted for as a past-service cost.

Net-interest expense or income is recognised within finance income (see note 9).

The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position represents
the deficit or surplus in the Group’s defined benefit schemes. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is
limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the schemes or
reductions in future contributions to the schemes.

A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw
the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs.

**Leases**

Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

_The Group as lessor_

Equipment leased to customers under finance leases is deemed to be sold at normal selling price and this
value is recognised as revenue at the inception of the lease. The associated asset is recognised within cost
of sales at the inception of the lease. Receivables under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due
under these agreements, less finance charges allocated to future periods. Finance lease interest is
recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash
investments.

Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant
lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

F-143


-----

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

_The Group as lessee_

Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the
present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the statement of financial position as a finance lease
obligation.

Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to
achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses are
recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which
case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group’s general policy on borrowing costs. Contingent
rentals are recognised as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred.

Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the
relevant lease except where another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in
which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating
leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.

In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised
as a liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the
time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.

**Government grants**

Government grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with
the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.

Government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the
Group recognises as expenses the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.
Specifically, government grants whose primary condition is that the Group should purchase, construct or
otherwise acquire non-current assets are recognised as deferred revenue in the consolidated statement of
financial position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of
the related assets.

**Operating profit and exceptional items**

Operating profit is stated after exceptional items, including restructuring costs, impairment, and after the
share of results of associates but before finance income and finance costs.

Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature or material, either
by magnitude or nature, that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid the
distortion of underlying performance, for example one-off impairments, redundancy programmes,
restructuring and costs related to significant corporate finance activities. The Directors believe the
resulting EBITDA represents underlying performance, excluding significant one-off and non-recurring
events, that more fairly represents the on-going trading performance of the business. These items are
therefore presented separately on the face of the income statement.

**Foreign currencies**

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction,
except in the case of certain financing transactions where hedging arrangements are in place and
transactions are recorded at the contracted rate.

Monetary assets and liabilities denoted in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at
the balance sheet date or the contracted rate if applicable. Any exchange differences arising are taken to
the income statement. Transactions in the income statement of overseas operations are translated using an
average exchange rate.

F-144

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**3 Significant accounting policies (Continued)**

Exchange differences on translation of overseas branches are recognised through the statement of
comprehensive income.

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty**

In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 3, the directors are
required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are
based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may
differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that
period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future
periods.

**Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty in applying the Group’s accounting policies**

The following are the critical judgements and those involving estimations that the Directors have made in
the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the
amounts recognised in financial statements.

**Revenue recognition**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

In applying the Group’s revenue recognition policy, as set out in note 3, judgements are made in respect of
certain areas including:

- determination of distinct contract components and performance obligations;

- the recognition of a significant financing component.

_Key estimations:_

In applying the Group’s revenue recognition policy, as set out in note 3, estimations are made in respect of
certain areas including:

- measurement of variable consideration;

- in the application of the percentage of completion approach to long-term contractual arrangements
which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs, as well as reliable
measurement of the progress made towards completion.

The aforementioned judgements are consistently applied across similar contracts and key estimates are
regularly monitored throughout the relevant contractual periods with reference to the stage of completion
and any applicable customer milestone acceptance. This is particularly relevant to the approach for
significant engineering projects, such as the 700MHz clearance programme, which typically contain a
programme build phase and a long-term operational phase.

**Deferred tax**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

The largest element of deferred tax that requires judgement relates to tax losses carried forward (see
note 20).

Applicable accounting standards permit the recognition of deferred tax assets only to the extent that future
taxable profits will be generated to utilise the tax losses carried forward.

F-145

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

**Useful lives for property, plant and equipment and intangibles**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.

Depreciation or amortisation is charged to the income statement based upon the useful lives selected. This
assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will derive benefit from these assets.

The Group manages its property, plant and equipment on a portfolio basis through a central estates team.
This team contains qualified surveyors who have a wealth of experience working for the Group and within
the industry as a whole.

The carrying values of intangibles are disclosed in note 15, and those for property, plant and equipment are
disclosed in note 16.

**Provisions and contingent liabilities**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

As disclosed in note 26, the Group’s provisions principally relate to obligations arising from contractual
obligations, restructuring and property remediation plans and decommissioning obligations.

The identification of such obligations in the context of daily operations which require provisions to be
made requires judgement.

Judgement is also required to distinguish between provisions and contingent liabilities.

_Key estimations:_

Estimates have been made in respect of the probable future obligations of the Group. These estimates are
reviewed annually to reflect current economic conditions and strategic plans.

Management exercises judgement in measuring the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 28)
through assessing the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise, and in quantifying the possible
range of financial outcomes.

**Impairment of goodwill**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

The carrying amount of the Group’s goodwill is reviewed at each statement of financial position date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment, in compliance with the Group’s accounting
policies.

Judgement is used to identify indicators of impairment and their impact upon the goodwill balances.

_Key estimations:_

Deciding the recoverable amount of a line of business to which goodwill is attributed involves management
estimates. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and the value in use.

The Group determines these values using methods based on discounted cash flows. These discounted cash
flows are founded on five-year projections built on financial plans approved by the Board. The cash flow
projections take account of past experience, and are based on management’s best estimates of future
developments based on contracted growth and necessary expenditure to maintain the assets required to
generate that expected revenue. Cash flows beyond the planning period are extrapolated using an expected
terminal growth rate.

The key assumptions underlying the changes in value in use involve estimates of the discount rate (with
reference to weighted average costs of capital), projected cash flows and terminal growth rate.

The carrying amount of goodwill at the statement of financial position date is disclosed in note 14.

F-146

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)**

**Actuarial assumptions used to determine the carrying amount of the Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities**

_Critical accounting judgements:_

The Group’s defined benefit plan liabilities are discounted at a rate set by reference to market yields at the
end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. Significant judgement is required when
setting the criteria for bonds to be included in the population from which the yield curve is derived.

The most significant criteria considered for the selection of bonds include the issue size of the corporate
bonds, quality of the bonds and the identification of outliers which are excluded. The Group selects these
assumptions in consultation with an external qualified actuary.

_Key estimations:_

Estimates are used in determining the present value of the scheme liabilities, which depend on such factors
as the life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of our current employees and price inflation.

**Fair value measurements and valuation processes**

_Key estimations_

Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In
estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is
available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group uses estimation techniques in accordance with
the requirements of IFRS 13. This includes the assessment of the fair value adjustments with respect to
credit risk (specifically debt/credit valuation adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities) for
which the Group incorporates market-observable data into its valuation techniques.

Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets
and liabilities are disclosed in notes 14 and 25.

**5 Revenue and segmental information**

The Group derives its revenue from the rendering of services, engineering projects, and the sale of
communications equipment. See note 3 for the accounting policies adopted.

Information reported to the Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) (which is collectively the
Group’s Board of Directors, including the CEO and CFO) for the purposes of resource allocation and the
assessment of segmental performance is focused on the three customer-facing business units, supported by
central corporate functions which are non-revenue generating. The Group’s reportable segments under
IFRS 8 are therefore:

- Terrestrial Broadcast;

- Telecoms & M2M; and

- Satellite and Media.

The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies
described in note 3.

Segmental result represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of the reconciling items
above or central administration costs including investment revenue and finance costs, and income tax
expense. This is the measure reported to the Group’s CODM for the purpose of resource allocation and
assessment of segment performance.

For the purpose of monitoring segment performance and allocating resources between segments, the
CODM monitors the capital expenditure of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets
(presented on a cash basis) planned and utilised by each segment, an analysis of which is shown below.

**Terrestrial** **Telecoms &** **Satellite and**
**Broadcast** **M2M** **Media** **Other*** **Consolidated**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**
**Capital expenditure:**
For the year ended 30 June 2018 . . . . . . . . . . 73.2 48.9 10.2 32.8 **165.1**
For the year ended 30 June 2017 . . . . . . . . . . 44.6 79.4 11.7 25.6 **161.3**

- Includes maintenance capex which is managed centrally and not allocated to individual business segments.

Note: the above is presented on a cash basis and therefore cannot be agreed directly to the capital additions presented in notes 15 and
16. The total balance comprises property, plant and equipment of £161.4m (2017: £151.0m) and intangible assets of £3.7m (2017:
£10.3m) as referred to in the cash flow statement.

**Geographical information**

The UK is the Group’s country of domicile and the Group generates the majority of its revenue from
external customers in the UK. The geographic analysis of revenue is on the basis of the country of origin in
which the customer is invoiced.

1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and refers to ‘earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation’ and includes
add-backs for certain items charged to operating profit that do not reflect the underlying business performance. The table
above reconciles this adjusted profit measure back to operating profit as presented in the income statement.

2 Includes add-backs for certain profit or loss on disposal of other intangibles and property, plant and equipment and includes
deductions for non-interest related finance costs, principally bank charges that are not considered relevant in understanding the
underlying performance of the business.

**Total tax (credit) / charge for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(227.8)** **0.1**

UK Corporation tax is calculated at the weighted average rate of 19.0% (2017: 19.75%) of the estimated
taxable profit for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the
respective jurisdictions.

The (credit) / charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit / (loss) in the income statement as follows:

**Year ended** **Year ended**

**Total tax (credit) / charge for the year . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **(227.8)** **0.1**

The main rate of UK corporation tax was 19.0% during the year. In the Finance Act 2016 it was enacted
that the main rate of UK corporation tax would be further reduced to 17.0% from 1 April 2020. UK
deferred tax has been valued at 17.0% (30 June 2017: 17.0%) as this is the rate at which the deferred tax
balances are forecast to unwind.

The current tax credit in the period ended 30 June 2018 represents group relief surrendered by companies
within the Arqiva Broadcast Parent Limited group of consolidated companies to other companies within
the Arqiva Group Limited corporation tax group. This group relief is paid for at the UK corporation tax
rate of 19%.

There is a tax charge of £1.8m (2017: £nil) in respect of the actuarial movement of £10.8m (2017: £(0.5m))
in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

(a) Finance (No. 2) Act 2017 was substantively enacted on 31 October 2017 and introduced new rules to
restrict the deductibility of interest costs from 1 April 2017.

The overall effect of these changes, is that certain previously unrecognised deferred tax assets have been
recognised at 30 June 2018, as a result of the forecast utilisation of these assets being accelerated and their
realisation therefore being assessed as probable. These relate primarily to financial instruments, fixed asset
temporary differences and tax losses.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units
(‘CGUs’) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. The CGUs that have associated
goodwill are Terrestrial Broadcast, Telecoms & M2M and Satellite & Media. These are the smallest
identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows
from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.

The Group disposed of £6.8m of goodwill in relation to its investment in Arqiva WiFi Limited which was
disposed of by the Group on 1 November 2016. See note 29 for further information.

The carrying value of goodwill as at the balance sheet date by the principal CGUs is shown as follows:

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that
goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use
calculations (‘VIU’). The key assumptions for the VIU calculations are those regarding the discount rates,
growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the year for which management has detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the
time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. Growth rates are based on internal and external
growth forecasts. Changes to cash flows are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in
the market.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**14 Goodwill (Continued)**

_Projected cash flows and the ‘recoverable amount’_

The value in use of each CGU is determined from the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent
financial forecasts approved by the Board for the next five years. They reflect management’s expectations
of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure and working capital based on past experience and future
expectations of performance.

_Discount rate_

The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived using the capital asset pricing
model for comparable businesses. The assumptions used are benchmarked to externally available data.
The pre-tax discount rate used is 8.0% (2017: 8.0%).

_Terminal growth rates_

The terminal growth rate is determined based on the long-term growth rates of the markets in which the
CGU operates (2018: 1.4%; 2017: 1.8%). The growth rate has been benchmarked against externally
available data. This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.

_Sensitivities_

There is significant headroom in all CGUs. No reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would
cause the carrying amount of the goodwill by CGU to exceed the recoverable amount based upon the VIU.

The Group’s policy is to recommend providing for trade receivables outstanding for more than 30 days
beyond the agreed terms, or where the business environment indicates a specific risk. Management will
make an assessment of the level of provision based on the Group policy. Adjustments to the calculated
level of provision will be made accordingly.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality
of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Before accepting
any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s
credit quality. For further information on how the Group manages credit risk see note 25.

Deferred tax assets are not recognised unless it is probable that there are sufficient taxable profits against
which they will be realised. The Group has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £31.8m (2017: £255.3m).
This is in respect of tax losses of £31.8m (2017: £50.8m), derivative financial instruments of £nil (2017:
£166.3m) fixed asset temporary differences of £nil (2017: £38.1m) and other temporary differences of £nil
(2017: £0.2m). These deferred tax assets may be carried forward indefinitely.

This value has been calculated based on the UK corporation tax rate of 17.0% (2017: 17.0%); the rate
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date effective from 1 April 2020, which is the rate at which the
deferred tax balances are forecast to unwind.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £nil (2017: £nil) relating to the
unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timings of the reversal of
these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.

Finance (No. 2) Act 2017 was substantively enacted on 31 October 2017 and introduced new rules to
restrict the deductibility of interest costs from 1 April 2017.

Due to the impact of these changes, significant previously unrecognised deferred tax assets were assessed
as being recoverable during the period ended 30 June 2018. This is a result of the forecast utilisation of
these assets being accelerated and their realisation therefore being assessed as probable.

A net deferred tax asset of £206.1m has therefore been recognised within these financial statements as at
30 June 2018. This asset relates primarily to financial instruments, fixed asset temporary differences and
tax losses.

There remains an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £31.8m. This asset has not been recognised since it is
not probable that these assets will be able to be utilised against future taxable profits of the Group.

The forecasts used for deferred tax asset recognition are the same as those used in the Group’s impairment
testing. It is not considered probable that the remaining unrecognised deferred tax asset can be utilised by
the Group in the foreseeable future. The recognised deferred tax asset is not considered to be materially
exposed to the performance of the Group based on reasonably possible trading forecasts.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**23 Borrowings (Continued)**

The remaining senior notes relate to a number of US private placement issues in both sterling and US
dollars with fixed and floating interest rates. The Group has £518.5m of sterling denominated floating rate
US private placements that are amortising in nature with repayments due between December 2018 and
December 2029. These instruments have a margin over LIBOR of between 210 and 220 bps. In addition,
the Group has issued £398.5m of fixed rate US private placements in sterling and US dollar denominated
notes. These notes have fixed interest rates which range between 4.101% and 4.420% and have amortising
repayment profiles commencing December 2018 with a final maturity date of June 2025. Arqiva PP
Financing Plc (‘APPF’) is the issuer of all of the Group’s private placement notes.

All of the above financing instruments have covenants attached, principally an interest cover ratio and a
debt leverage ratio, and benefit from security over substantially all of the Group’s assets under a Whole
Business Securitisation structure. The Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

**Junior bonds of £600.0m represent amounts raised from the issuance of notes by Arqiva Broadcast**
Finance Plc. These notes have a fixed interest rate of 9.5% and are repayable in March 2020. These notes
are listed on the Luxembourg Market and have interest cover and debt leverage covenants attached. The
Group continues to comply with all covenant requirements.

**25 Financial instruments and risk management**

**Capital risk management**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going
concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity
balance.

The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (as set out in note 27; see note 21 for cash and cash
equivalents and note 23 for borrowings) and equity of the Group (comprising issued capital and share
premium, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests).

Levels of debt are maintained on an ongoing basis to ensure that no breaches occur and repayments can be
and are made as necessary with refinancings carried out as required.

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

**Significant accounting policies**

Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted (including criteria for recognition, the basis
of measurement and the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset and
financial liability are disclosed in full in note 3.

The Group’s derivatives (i.e. interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps) are measured on a fair value
through profit and loss basis. Whilst the Group’s derivatives act as an effective hedge in economic terms,
hedge accounting principles are not applied. This means that the Group’s derivatives are recognised at
their risk-adjusted fair value (i.e. risk-adjusted Mark-to-Market value) at the date they are entered into
and are revalued at each balance sheet date, with gains and losses being reported separately in the income
statement within ‘other gains and losses’. Net amounts paid in the year (excluding termination amounts)
on interest rate swaps (together with similar amounts under the cross currency and index linked swaps) are
reported as a component of net bank and other loan interest within finance costs.

**Financial risk management**

The Group’s treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and
international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the
Group using financial instruments wherever it is appropriate to do so. The treasury function reports
directly into the Chief Financial Officer and the Group’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, an
independent function with a scope that includes monitoring the risks and policies implemented to mitigate
risk exposures. The main risks addressed by financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign
currency exchange risk. The Group’s policies in respect of these risks remain unchanged throughout the
year.

The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign
currency and interest rate risk, including:

- Interest rate swaps, including inflation-linked interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of movement in
interest rates;

- Cross-currency swaps to mitigate the risk of currency exposures on foreign denominated borrowings;
and

- Forward foreign exchange contracts to manage exchange risks arising from transactional foreign
exchange exposures.

The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments,
for speculative purposes.

**Foreign currency risk management**

The Group principally operates from UK sites and predominantly in the UK market, but has some
overseas subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. While some customer and
supplier contracts are denominated in other currencies (mainly US dollars (‘USD’) and Euro), the majority
of the Group’s revenue and costs are Sterling based and accordingly exposure to foreign exchange risk is
limited.

Foreign currency exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation
risk:

**_Transactional risk:_** The Group’s policy is to hedge material transactional currency exposures via the use of
forward foreign exchange contracts. The measurement and control of this risk is monitored on a Group—
wide basis.

**_Translation risk:_** The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting
policy in note 3. Given the Group predominantly operates in the UK, there is a relatively small exposure
with overseas entities accounting for only 0.3% (2017: 0.2%) of operating profit and 0.3% (2017: 0.1%) of
total assets for the Group.

- refers to Singapore dollar, being the most frequently transacted currency within ‘other monetary assets and liabilities’.

Foreign currency denominated cash balances have a weighted average interest rate of 0.0% (2017: 0.0%).

During the year cross currency swaps (nominal value USD 358.0m) were used to fix the exchange rate to
$1.52/£1 in relation to US dollar-denominated senior notes (nominal value USD 358.0m). This provides an
effective economic hedge of the foreign currency impact on the Sterling cost of future interest and capital
repayment obligations.

After taking into account our hedging activities, management does not consider there to be a material
residual exposure to exchange rates. Accordingly no sensitivity analysis has been presented.

**Interest rate risk management**

The Group has variable rate bank and US private placement debt and uses interest rate swaps (‘IRS’) and
inflation-linked swaps (‘ILS’) to hedge its exposure to rising interest rates. The Group maintains a hedging
policy to manage interest rate risk and to ensure the certainty of future interest cash flows. The Group has
fixed rate hedging, split between IRS and ILS. IRS convert variable rate interest costs to fixed rate interest
costs while ILS convert fixed or variable rate interest costs to RPI-linked costs, which fluctuate in line with
the RPI index as do a portion of the Group’s revenue contracts. These swaps are entered into on terms
(including maturity) that mirror the debt instrument they hedge, and therefore act as an effective economic
hedge.

As the Group uses hedging to maintain fixed interest rates on all of its material borrowings (excluding
revolving facilities), there is minimal exposure on the interest expense to interest rate movements. A rise or
fall in interest rates would therefore not materially impact the interest expense payable by the Group.

**Liquidity risk management**

To ensure it has sufficient available funds for working capital requirements and planned growth, the Group
maintains cash reserves and access to undrawn committed facilities to cover forecast requirements. The
Group carefully manages the counterparty credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments
with balances currently spread across a range of major financial institutions, which have satisfactory credit
ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies. The levels of credit risk are monitored through the
Group’s ongoing risk management processes, which include a regular review of counterparty credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level and term for deposits with any single
counterparty.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

The Group is due to repay £1.6bn of debt in the next 5 years to 30 June 2023. Regular reviews are
performed to assess headroom between interest and capital repayments against forecast cash flows, thus
monitoring the liquidity risk and the Group’s ability to repay the debt.

The following tables set out the maturity profile of the Group’s non-derivative financial liabilities and
derivative financial liabilities. The amounts presented in respect of the non-derivative financial liabilities
represent the gross contractual cash flows on an un-discounted basis. Accordingly, these amounts may not
reconcile directly with the amounts disclosed in the statement of financial position. The amounts presented
in respect of the Group’s derivative financial instruments represent their fair value and are accordingly
consistent with the amounts included in the statement of financial position.

When debt has been refinanced the Group has also restructured the associated swaps to reflect the new
maturity profile.

**Credit risk management**

The Group is exposed to credit risk on customer receivables, which is managed through credit-checking
procedures prior to taking on new customers and higher risk customers paying in advance of services being
provided. Performance is closely monitored to ensure agreed service levels are maintained, reducing the
level of queried payments and mitigating the risk of uncollectable debts.

**Financial instruments**

With the exception of derivative financial instruments (which are recognised and measured at fair value
through profit and loss) the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and measured
following the loans and receivables recognition category.

The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 30 June 2018 was 6.10%
(2017: 6.10%) and the weighted average period of funding was 5.0 years (2017: 5.9 years).

Within the Group’s financial liabilities were borrowings of £2,999.6m (2017: £2,862.9m) (see note 23),
which includes £1,038.5m (2017: £1,118.5m) with floating rate interest and the remainder with fixed rate
interest (prior to the hedging arrangements described previously).

The Group’s financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents of £38.8m (2017: £35.6m) and loans and
receivables of £218.8m (2017: £225.3m) as presented in notes 21 and 18 respectively.

**Derivative financial instruments**

The Group seeks to manage the exposures of its debt payment obligations through a combination of
indexed linked, interest rate and cross currency swaps.

In conjunction with the November 2016 refinancing (see note 23), the Group restructured the derivatives
held by Arqiva Senior Finance Limited (‘ASFL’). £353.2m notional value of swap options were fully closed
out for cash proceeds of £3.2m and £353.2m of notional value of interest rate swaps were terminated for a
cash payment of £163.3m. Simultaneously, AF1 entered into new interest rate swap contracts with a
notional amount of £353.5m to hedge the interest obligations of the newly established bank term loan and
US private placement notes which resulted in a premium of £127.2m being received. These amendments to
the derivative portfolio resulted in a £15.4m exceptional loss being recognised in other gains and losses
(see note 11). As part of these amendments, the mandatory break clauses were removed.

The above amendments were completed in order to comply with the covenants under its WBS platform
and the Group’s overall strategy to ensure that a majority of interest exposures are hedged.

At the year end, the Group held interest rate swaps with notional amounts of £976.5m which hedge the
interest obligations of the Group’s floating rate debt. The average fixed rate on these instruments is 6.96%.
The swap contracts have termination dates that match the maturities of the underlying floating rate debt
instruments (see note 23).

The Group has also entered into index linked swaps (notional amounts of £1,312.5m) where the Group
receives floating and pays fixed interest obligations to an average rate of 2.906% indexed with RPI. The

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**25 Financial instruments and risk management (Continued)**

notional amounts of these swaps increase with RPI and these accretion amounts are cash settled annually,
most recently in June 2018 (£58.6m; 2017: £53.4m). All of these instruments have a maturity date of April
2027 except for a notional amount of £235.0m which have a mandatory break clause in 2023. These
instruments were established to hedge the Group’s fixed rate debt (namely fixed rate sterling bonds and
the fixed rate US Private Placement issues) and in order to ensure that the cash flow characteristics align
with these instruments, the Group has entered into £1,312.5m of fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps to
match the cash flows on both the fixed rate debt instruments and the index linked swaps set out above.

The Group also holds USD 358.0m of cross-currency swaps to fix the Sterling cost of future interest and
capital repayment obligations relating to the US dollar denominated private placement issue at an
exchange rate of 1.52.

The fair value of the interest rate, inflation and cross currency swaps at 30 June 2018 is a liability of
£1,030.8m (2017: £1,179.7m). This fair value is calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate.

Following their close-out in November 2016, the Group no longer holds any swap options (2017: £nil).

The following table details the fair value of financial instruments recognised on the statement of financial
position within non-current liabilities:

**Total change in fair value . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **148.9** **(33.4)**

Where possible, the Group seeks to match the maturity of any derivative contracts with that of debt
instruments that it has issued. In some of the Group’s derivative instruments, break clauses have been
included to both match underlying facility maturities and to optimise the availability and cost of hedging
lines with the Group’s derivative counterparties.

**Fair value hierarchy**

Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into
levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:

- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included
within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices); and

- Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for
the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

Interest rate swaps, inflation rate swaps, swap options and cross-currency swaps (as disclosed above) are all
classed as level 2 on the fair value hierarchy. In each case the items are valued based upon discounted cash
flow. Future cash flows are estimated based on forward (interest / inflation / exchange) rates observable
from rates and yield curves at the end of the reporting period, and contract rates, discounted at a
risk-adjusted rate.

Provisions are made for decommissioning and asset at risk costs where the Group has an obligation to
restore sites and the cost of restoration is not recoverable from third parties. The provision is in relation to
assets of which the remaining useful economic life ranges up to 18 years.

The restructuring provision relates to the costs of exceptional activities to reorganise the Group through its
FutureFit programme, the majority of which has been utilised during the current financial year.

The remediation provision represents the cost of works identified as being required across a number of the
Group’s sites and is expected to be utilised over the next one to ten years.

Other provisions represent a variety of smaller items which are expected to be utilised over the next one to
three years.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**30 Retirement benefits**

**Defined contribution scheme**

Arqiva Limited has operated a Defined Contribution Scheme during the year, for those employees who are
not members of the Group’s Defined Benefit Plan. Contributions payable in respect of this Scheme for the
year were £10.8m (2017: £10.7m). The assets of the Scheme are held outside of the Group.

An amount of £1.3m (2017: £0.7m) is included in accruals being the outstanding contributions to the
Defined Contribution Scheme.

**Defined benefit plan**

In the year to 30 June 2018, the Group operated one Defined Benefit Plan, sponsored by Arqiva Limited.
The Defined Benefit Plan is administered by a separate entity that is legally separated from the Group,
and therefore the Plan assets are held separately from those of Arqiva Limited. The trustees of the Plan
are required by law to act in the interests of the Plan and of all relevant stakeholders in the Plan. The
trustees are responsible for the investment policy with regard to the Plan assets.

The Plan typically exposes the Group to risks such as: investment risk, interest rate risk, longevity risk, and
salary risk.

**Investment risk . . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability for IAS19 purposes is
calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high quality
corporate bond yields, which is different to how the Plan assets are invested.
Currently the Plan has a relatively balanced investment in equity securities,
debt instruments and real estate. Due to the long-term nature of the Plan
liabilities, the trustees of the Plan consider it appropriate that a reasonable
portion of the Plan assets should be invested in equity securities to leverage
the expected return generated by the Plan assets.

**Interest risk . . . . . . . . .** A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the valuation of the Plan’s
IAS19 liability but this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the
Plan’s corporate bond investments.

**Longevity risk . . . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by
reference to a best estimate of the mortality of Plan participants both during
and after their retirement. An increase in the life expectancy of the Plan
participants will increase the Plan’s assessed liability.

**Salary risk . . . . . . . . . .** The present value of the defined benefit Plan liability is calculated by
reference to the future salaries of Plan participants. As such, an increase in the
salary of the Plan participants will increase the Plan’s liability.

The Plan closed to the future accrual of benefits on 31 January 2016. The weighted average duration of the
expected benefit payments from the Plan is around 20 years.

The most recent triennial actuarial funding valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the
defined benefit liability was carried out as at 30 June 2017 by an independent firm of consulting actuaries,
and is in the final stages of approval. The present value of the IAS19 defined benefit liability, and the
related current service cost and past service cost, have been measured using the projected unit credit
method based on roll-forward updates to the triennial valuation figures.

The majority of the Plan’s equity and debt instruments have quoted prices in active markets.

The Plan includes holdings of gilts and corporate bonds, which are intended to partially hedge the financial
risk from liability valuation movements associated with changes in gilt and corporate bond yields. IAS19
liability movements from changes in the discount rate will also be partially hedged by the Plan’s corporate
bond holding.

**Notes to the Group financial statements (Continued)**

**30 Retirement benefits (Continued)**

No amounts within the fair value of the Plan assets are in respect of the Group’s own financial instruments
or any property occupied by, or assets used by, the Group.

Following completion of the funding valuation as at 30 June 2014, Arqiva Limited agreed to pay deficit
contributions of £2.5m per annum to 31 July 2018, and then payments of £3.3m per annum to July 2020.
The Group anticipates that cash contributions due to the defined benefit plan for the year ending 30 June
2019 will be £5.8m. These future contributions will be determined upon approval of the funding valuation
as at 30 June 2017.

**Sensitivity Analysis**

The assumptions considered to be the most significant are the discount rate adopted, inflation represented
by RPI, and the longevity assumptions.

The sensitivity of the 2018 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **decrease of 0.1%** **RPI increase of 0.1%** **increase of +1 year**

Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £4.2m £3.1m £6.4m


The sensitivity of the 2017 year end results to changes in the three key assumptions is shown below:

**Discount rate** **Longevity assumption**
**Funding Position** **decrease of 0.1%** **RPI increase of 0.1%** **increase of +1 year**

Increase in Plan liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . £5.1m £5.2m £7.1m


This sensitivity analysis may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as
it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the
assumptions may be correlated.

**31 Related party transactions**

Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been
