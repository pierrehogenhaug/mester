statements other than those of historical fact. Disclosures that use words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,”

forward-looking statements reflect our then-current expectations and are based upon data available to us at the time the statements are
made. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from
expectations. The most material, known risks are detailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum, and the
sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” incorporated by
reference into this offering memorandum. All forward-looking statements in, or incorporated by reference into, this offering
memorandum are qualified by these cautionary statements and are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum or the date

forward-looking statements fall under the safe harbors of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). The following risks, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from
those described in any forward-looking statements:

    - we have substantial debt and, after issuance of the notes offered hereby, and the use of proceeds as described herein, we
will have the ability to incur significant additional debt, including additional secured debt, any of which could restrict our
future operating and strategic flexibility and expose us to the risks of financial leverage;

    - the agreements governing our various debt and other obligations restrict, and are expected to continue to restrict, our
business and limit our ability to take certain actions;

    - our ability to meet our debt service obligations on the notes and our other debt will depend on our future performance,
which is, and will be, subject to many factors that are beyond our control;

    - our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to
increase significantly;

    - we are dependent on advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and may also fluctuate as a result of a
number of other factors, including any continuation of uncertain financial and economic conditions;

    - we are highly dependent upon a limited number of advertising categories;

    - we intend to seek to grow through strategic acquisitions, and acquisitions involve risks and uncertainties;

    - we may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition;

    - we purchase television programming in advance of earning any related revenue, and may not earn sufficient revenue to
offset the costs thereof;

    - we are highly dependent on network affiliations and may lose a significant amount of television programming if a
network terminates or significantly changes its affiliation with us;

    - we are dependent on our retransmission consent agreements with multichannel video programming distributors
(“MVPDs”) and any potential changes to the retransmission consent regime could materially adversely affect our
business;

    - we may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business and operating results;

    - cybersecurity incidents impacting our information technology infrastructure or those of our third-party service providers
could interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our
business and reputation to suffer;

    - we are subject to risks of competition from local television stations as well as from cable systems, the internet and other
video providers;

iv


-----

    - we may incur impairment charges related to our assets;

    - we are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash;

    - we may incur significant capital and operating costs, including costs related to our obligations under our defined benefit
pension plans;

    - we are subject to risks and limitations due to government regulation of the broadcasting industry, including Federal
Communications Commission (“FCC”) control over the renewal and transfer of broadcasting licenses, which could
materially adversely affect our operations and growth strategy;

    - certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability to exert significant influence over us;

    - we may be subject to changes in or the application of new or revised accounting standards or tax policies which could
have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition; and

_of factors, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” elsewhere in the offering memorandum. Unless otherwise_

**Our Company**

**_General_**

We are a multimedia company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. We are the nation’s largest owner of top-rated local
television stations and digital assets in the United States. As of March 31, 2024, our television stations serve 114 television markets
that collectively reach approximately 36% of U.S. television households, including 79 markets with the top-rated television station and
102 markets with the first and/or second highest rated television station. We also own video program companies Raycom Sports,
Tupelo Media Group, PowerNation Studios, as well as the studio production facilities Assembly Atlanta and Third Rail Studios.

Our operating revenues are derived primarily from broadcast and internet advertising, retransmission consent fees and, to a
lesser extent, other sources such as production of television and event programming, television commercials, tower rentals and
management fees. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenue of $3.3 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of
$816 million. As of March 31, 2024, our L8QA Leverage Ratio Denominator was $1,079 million. For a reconciliation of Adjusted
EBITDA and Leverage Ratio Denominator, see “— Summary Historical Consolidated Financial and Other Data.”

We were incorporated in 1897, initially to publish the Albany Herald in Albany, Georgia, and entered the broadcasting
industry in 1953. We have a dedicated and experienced senior management team.

**_Markets and Stations_**

We believe a key driver for our strong market position is our focus on strong local news and information programming. We
believe that our market position and our strong local teams have enabled us to maintain more stable revenues compared to many of our
peers.

We are diversified across our markets and network affiliations. In 2023 and 2022, our largest market, by revenue, was
Phoenix, Arizona, which contributed 4% and 5% of our revenue, respectively. Our top 10 markets by revenue contributed
approximately 25% and 26% of our total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, our CBS-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 39% of total revenue; our NBC-affiliated channels
accounted for approximately 27% of total revenue; our FOX-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 14% of total revenue;
and our ABC-affiliated channels accounted for approximately 11% of total revenue. We refer to CBS, NBC, ABC and FOX as the
“Big Four” networks.

In each of our markets, we own and operate at least one television station broadcasting a primary channel affiliated with one
of the Big Four networks. We also own additional stations in some markets, some of which also broadcast primary channels affiliated
with one of the Big Four networks. Nearly all of our stations broadcast secondary digital channels that are affiliated with various
networks or are independent of any network. The terms of our affiliations with broadcast networks are governed by network affiliation
agreements. Each network affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by
the affiliated network. Our network affiliation agreements with the Big Four broadcast networks currently expire at various dates
through January 1, 2026.

**_Business Strategy_**

Our success is based on the following strategies:

1


-----

**_Grow by Leveraging Our Diverse National Footprint.  We serve a diverse and national footprint of television stations. We_**
currently operate in DMAs ranked between 7 and 209. We operate in many markets that we believe have the potential for significant
political advertising revenue in periods leading up to elections. We are also diversified across our broadcast programming.

**_Maintain and Grow Our Market Leadership Position.  According to Comscore, during 2023, our owned and operated_**
television stations achieved the #1 ranking in overall audience in 79 of the 113 markets we served as of December 31, 2023. In
addition, our stations achieved the #1 and/or #2 ranking in overall audience in 102 of those 113 markets.

We believe there are significant advantages in operating the #1 or #2 television broadcasting stations in a local market.
Strong audience and market share allow us to enhance our advertising revenue through price discipline and leadership. We believe a
top-rated local news platform is critical to capturing incremental sponsorship and political advertising revenue. Our high-quality
station group allows us to generate higher operating margins, which allows us additional opportunities to reinvest in our business to
further strengthen our network and local news ratings. Furthermore, we believe operating the top ranked stations in our various
markets allows us to attract and retain top talent.

We also believe that our local market leadership positions help us in negotiating more beneficial terms in our major network
affiliation agreements, which currently expire at various dates through January 1, 2026, and in our syndicated programming
agreements. These leadership positions also give us additional leverage to negotiate retransmission contracts with cable system
operators, telephone video distributors, direct broadcast satellite operators and other MVPDs.

We intend to maintain our market leadership position through continued prudent investment in our local news and syndicated
programs, as well as continued technological advances and workflow improvements. We expect to continue to invest in technological
upgrades in the future. We believe the foregoing will help us maintain and grow our market leadership, thereby enhancing our ability
to grow and further diversify our revenues and cash flows.

**_Continue to Pursue Strategic Growth and Accretive Acquisition Opportunities.  Over the last several years, the television_**
broadcasting industry has been characterized by a high level of acquisition activity. We believe that there are a number of television
stations, and a few station groups, that have attractive operating profiles and characteristics, and that share our commitment to local
news coverage in the communities in which they operate and to creating high-quality and locally-driven content. On a highly selective
basis, from time to time we may pursue opportunities for the acquisition of additional television stations or station groups that fit our
strategic and operational objectives, and where we believe that we can improve revenue, efficiencies and cash flow through active
management and cost controls. As we consider potential acquisitions, we primarily evaluate potential station audience and revenue
shares and the extent to which the acquisition target would positively impact our existing station operations. We also consider the
amount of leverage that an acquisition would entail and our ability to carry such additional leverage at and after the time of
acquisition. Consistent with this strategy, between late 2013 and early 2023, we have completed numerous acquisition and divestiture
transactions, including some that had a material impact on our results of operations.

On April 1, 2022, we acquired television station WKTB-TV (a Telemundo Network Group, LLC affiliate) in the Atlanta,
Georgia market, as well as certain digital media assets, for a combined purchase price of $31 million, using cash on hand (the “2022
**_Acquisition”)._**

On May 1, 2023, we sold television station KNIN (FOX) in the Boise, Idaho market for $6 million to Marquee Broadcasting,
Inc., and subsequently purchased television station WPGA (MeTV) in the Macon, Georgia market for $6 million from Marquee
Broadcasting, Inc. (the “2023 Transactions”).

Collectively, we refer to the 2022 Acquisition and the 2023 Transactions as the “Transactions”. We expect that the
Transactions will create opportunities to reduce or eliminate redundancies in our combined operations, and that these synergies will be
implemented in phases over several years.

**_Continue to Monetize Digital Spectrum.  In addition to each station’s primary channel, we also broadcast a number of_**
secondary channels. Certain secondary channels are simultaneously affiliated with more than one network. Our strategy includes
expanding upon our digital offerings and sales. We continuously evaluate opportunities to use spectrum for future delivery of data to
mobile devices using a new transmission standard.

**_Continue to Maintain Prudent Cost Management.  Historically, we have closely managed costs to maintain and improve_**
our margins. We believe that our market leadership position provides additional negotiating leverage that enables us to lower, on a
relative basis, our syndicated programming costs. We are pursuing opportunities to use spectrum more efficiently for content and sales
by transitioning our stations to the new transmission standard called NextGen TV.

2


-----

**_Further Strengthen Our Balance Sheet.  During the last several years, we have leveraged our strong cash flow and_**
efficient operating model to grow our diverse national footprint. In 2023 and 2022, we made net principal payments totaling $310
million (including with proceeds from our Securitization Facility) and $315 million, respectively, reducing the balance outstanding
under our Senior Credit Agreement, including both voluntary and required payments. In 2021 and in other recent years, we acted to
improve the terms of our debt by amending or replacing our long-term debt to secure favorable terms while interest rates were at
historically low levels. During 2021, we completed the acquisition of all the equity interests of Meredith Corporation (“Meredith”)
and Quincy Media, Inc. (“Quincy”), and other transactions including divestitures resulting from the Meredith and Quincy acquisitions
using a financing plan composed of our cash on hand, attractively priced fixed rate debt, proceeds from divestitures, and amendments
to our Senior Credit Agreement. We continually evaluate opportunities to improve our balance sheet.

**Recent Developments**

**_Credit Agreement Amendment_**

In connection with this offering, we expect to enter into a third amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the Fifth Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Senior **_Credit Agreement”), dated as of December 1, 2021, by and among the_**
Company, the guarantors party thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the “Administrative
**_Agent”), and the other agents and lenders party thereto, pursuant to which, among other things, we expect to (i) incur $750 million of_**
new tranche F term loans (the “2024 Term Loan”) with a maturity date in 2029, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments under our
existing $625 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) by $55 million, resulting in aggregate commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility of $680 million and (iii) terminate the separate commitments under a $72.5 million tranche of the
Revolving Credit Facility that matures on December 1, 2026. The closing of this offering of notes is conditioned on the closing of the
Third Amendment, and the closing of the Third Amendment is conditioned on the closing of this offering. The completion of the
Third Amendment is subject to market and other conditions and there can be no assurance as to whether or when the Third
Amendment may be completed, if at all.

**_Tender Offer_**

Concurrently with the commencement of this offering, we are commencing a cash tender offer (the “Tender Offer”) to

**The Offering**

_The summary below describes the principal terms of the notes offered hereby. Certain of the terms and conditions described_
_below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum contains_
_a more detailed description of the terms of the notes offered hereby._

Issuer ...................................................................... Gray Television, Inc.

Notes Offered ......................................................... $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of    % senior secured first lien notes
due 2029 (the “notes”).

Issue Price .............................................................. %, plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2024

Maturity Date ........................................................., 2029.

Interest ................................................................... Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of    % per annum, payable semiannually, in cash in arrears, on       and        of each year,
commencing       , 2024.

Guarantees ............................................................. The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured first
lien basis by all of our existing and certain future domestic restricted
subsidiaries (other than certain subsidiaries who are not guarantors of
indebtedness incurred under the Senior Credit Agreement) (the “guarantees”).

Ranking .................................................................. The notes and the guarantees will be our and the guarantors’ senior secured
first lien obligations and will rank:

                        - equally in right of payment with all of our and the guarantors’ existing and
future pari passu senior debt (including the Senior Credit Agreement and
the existing notes);

                        - senior in right of payment to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and
future subordinated debt;

                        - effectively senior to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future
unsecured debt (including our existing notes and the existing note
guarantees) or junior lien debt to the extent of the value of the Collateral
securing the notes;

                        - effectively subordinated to any existing and future debt that is secured by
a lien on any assets not constituting Collateral securing the notes to the
extent of the value of such assets (including the collateral sold to the
Receivables SPV pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement); and

                        - structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt and liabilities of
our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes.

After giving effect to the Refinancing, as of March 31, 2024, the Company and
the guarantors would have had approximately $6.2 billion in aggregate
principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany debt
and before deducting financing costs), all of which would have been senior
debt (including the notes offered hereby), and of which approximately
$3.3 billion (including the notes offered hereby), plus an additional
$580 million of undrawn availability under our Revolving Credit Facility
(excluding approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit), would
have been secured by substantially all of the assets of us and the guarantors.

As of the issue date of the notes, we expect that all of the Company’s
subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted
subsidiaries) will be guarantors of the notes. After giving effect to the
Refinancing, as of March 31, 2024, the Company’s unrestricted subsidiaries
would have held approximately $883 million of assets.

-----

Collateral ............................................................... The notes and the guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests
in the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Credit
Agreement and our future senior secured indebtedness, subject to certain
excluded assets, exceptions and permitted liens, as described under
“Description of Notes — Collateral and Security.”

First Lien Intercreditor Agreement ........................ On the issue date, we will enter into a first lien intercreditor agreement (as
amended or otherwise modified from time to time, the “First Lien
**_Intercreditor Agreement”) by and among the Administrative Agent, the_**
Collateral Agent (as defined in “Description of Notes”), us and the guarantors,
and authorized representatives of the holders of any other future pari passu
debt incurred from time to time after the issue date. The First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement sets forth the rights of, and relationship among, the
Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent, and the applicable representatives
of the holders under any other future pari passu debt in respect of the exercise
of rights and remedies against us and the guarantors, the relative rights and
obligations of the holders of first lien obligations with respect to shared
collateral, and certain other matters relating to the administration of the
security interests. See “Description of Notes — Collateral and Security —
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.”

Optional Redemption ............................................. On or after       , 2026, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at
any time, at the redemption prices described under “Description of Notes —
Redemption — Optional Redemption.” In addition, we may redeem up to 40%
of the aggregate principal amount of the notes before       , 2026 with the
net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price
of      % of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the redemption date. We may also redeem some or all of the notes
before       , 2026 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus a “make
whole” premium.

Prior to        , 2026, we may redeem up to 10% of the original principal
amount of the notes (including any additional notes) in any twelve-month
period, at a price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to, but not including, the
redemption date.

Change of Control .................................................. If we experience certain kinds of changes of control, we will be required to
offer to purchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest. For more details, see “Description of Notes — Change of
Control.”

Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following
Certain Asset Sales ............................................... If we sell certain assets under certain circumstances, we will be required to use
the net proceeds from such sale to offer to purchase the notes at 100% of their
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as described under
“Description of Notes — Certain Covenants — Limitation on Asset Sales.”

Certain Covenants .................................................. The indenture will contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability
and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to:

                       - incur additional debt;

                       - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to
stockholders;

                       - make investments;

                       - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

5


-----

                        - enter into agreements restricting certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to pay
dividends or make certain other payments;

                        - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all
of our assets;

                        - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

                        - sell or transfer assets.

Certain covenants will be suspended for so long as the notes have investment
grade ratings from any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard &
Poor’s Rating Services, Fitch Ratings, Inc., or other nationally recognized
statistical rating organizations (as set forth in the “Description of Notes”). Any
covenants that should cease to apply to the notes as a result of achieving such
investment grade rating will later be reinstated if the credit rating of the notes
no longer meets such investment grade rating. See “Description of Notes —
Certain Covenants.”

These covenants will be subject to a number of important qualifications and
limitations.

Transfer Restrictions .............................................. The notes will not be registered under the Securities Act and may not be
offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. We do not intend
to list the notes on any securities exchange.

No Registration Rights .......................................... The notes will not have the benefit of any registered exchange offer or other
registration rights.

Absence of an Established Market for the Notes ... The notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently no
market. Although certain of the initial purchasers have informed us that they
intend to make a market in the notes, such initial purchasers are not obligated
to do so, and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without
notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the notes
will develop or be maintained.

Use of Proceeds ..................................................... We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with the net
proceeds of the 2024 Term Loan, availability under our Revolving Credit
Facility and cash on hand, to (i) refinance the 2019 Term Loan, (ii) finance the
Tender Offer and (iii) pay all fees and expenses in connection with this
offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may be lenders
under the 2019 Term Loan and therefore would receive a portion of the
proceeds of this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective
affiliates) may hold positions in the 2026 Notes that we may purchase in the
Tender Offer with the net proceeds from this offering, and those entities would
receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering as tender offer
consideration if they tender their 2026 Notes in accordance with the terms of
the Tender Offer. See “Use of Proceeds.”

Trustee ................................................................... U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

We have derived the following summary historical consolidated financial and other data as of and for each of the years ended
December 31, 2023 and 2022 from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes, and as of and for each of the three
months ended March 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, each
of which (other than data as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2022) is incorporated by reference in this offering
memorandum. We have derived the following summary historical consolidated financial and other data as of and for the twelve
months ended March 31, 2024 by adding the financial and other data from our audited consolidated financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2023 to the financial and other data from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three
months ended March 31, 2024 and subtracting the financial and other data from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023. You should not consider our results for the three month periods or the twelve
month period, or our financial condition as of any such dates, to be indicative of our results or financial condition to be expected for or
as of any other interim period or any full year period. The summary historical consolidated financial and other data presented below
does not contain all of the information you should consider before deciding whether or not to invest in the notes, and should be read in
conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated
financial statements, and notes thereto, incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum. We have made rounding adjustments
to reach some of the figures included in this offering memorandum. As a result, numerical figures shown as totals in some tables may
not be arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.

(1) Our operating results fluctuate significantly between years, in accordance with, among other things, increased political advertising expenditures
in even-numbered years.

(2) We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock-based
compensation, non-cash 401(k) expense, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, net, miscellaneous (income) expense, impairment of investments,
goodwill and other intangible assets, interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt and income tax expense (benefit).

We define Leverage Ratio Denominator as net income (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock-based
compensation costs, non-cash 401(k) expense, loss (gain) on asset disposals, loss (gain) on disposal of investments not in ordinary course,
impairment of investments, goodwill and other intangible assets, interest expense, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income tax expense
(benefit), amortization of program broadcast rights, payments for program broadcast rights, pension (gain) expense, contribution to pension
plan, adjustments for unrestricted subsidiaries, synergies, Transaction Related Expenses and certain other miscellaneous items.

Leverage Ratio Denominator is a metric that management uses to calculate our compliance with the financial covenants in our indebtedness
agreements. This metric is calculated as specified in our Senior Credit Agreement and is the denominator of a formula used to calculate material
financial covenants within the Senior Credit Agreement. These covenants govern our ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make
investments and make restricted payments, among other limitations usual and customary for credit agreements of this type. Accordingly,
management believes this metric is a very material metric to our debt and equity investors.

We define Free Cash Flow as net income (loss), adjusted for depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, non-cash stock-based compensation
costs, non-cash 401(k) expense, loss (gain) on asset disposals, loss (gain) on disposal of investments not in ordinary course, impairment of
investments, goodwill and other intangible assets, loss on early extinguishment of debt, income tax expense (benefit), amortization of program
broadcast rights, payments for program broadcast rights, pension (gain) expense, contribution to pension plan, adjustments for unrestricted
subsidiaries, synergies, Transaction Related Expenses, certain other miscellaneous items, amortization of deferred financing costs, preferred and
common dividends, purchase of property and equipment (net of reimbursements and certain defined purchases) and income taxes paid (net of
any refunds).

We use Free Cash Flow to approximate amounts of liquidity available to us to repay indebtedness, make investments, restricted payments and
other general corporate uses of liquidity.

Leverage Ratio Denominator and Free Cash Flow give effect to the revenue and broadcast expenses of all completed acquisitions and
divestitures as if they had been acquired or divested, respectively, on April 1, 2022. They also give effect to certain operating synergies expected
from the acquisitions and related financings and adds back professional fees incurred in completing the acquisitions. Certain financial
information related to the acquisitions, if applicable, has been derived from, and adjusted based on, unaudited, un-reviewed financial
information prepared by other entities, which Gray cannot independently verify. We cannot assure you that such financial information would not
be materially different if such information were audited or reviewed and no assurances can be provided as to the accuracy of such information,
or that our actual results would not differ materially from this financial information if the acquisitions had been completed on the stated date.

These non-GAAP terms are not defined in GAAP and our definitions may differ from, and therefore not be comparable to, similarly titled
measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness. Such terms are used by management in addition to and in conjunction with
results presented in accordance with GAAP and should be considered as supplements to, and not as substitutes for, net income and cash flows
reported in accordance with GAAP.

_are not the only ones we will face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair_
_our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could_
_be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of the notes could decline due to any of these risks, and you_
_may lose all or part of your investment. This offering memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements as a result of certain_
_factors, including the occurrence of one or more of the factors described in the following risk factors._

**Risks Related to an Investment in the Notes**

**_The notes will be effectively subordinated to the claims of the creditors of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and to indebtedness_**
**_secured by assets not constituting Collateral to the extent of the value of such assets (including the collateral sold to the_**
**_Receivables SPV pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement)._**

We conduct substantially all of our business through our subsidiaries, all of which (other than subsidiaries which we have
designated as unrestricted subsidiaries) are currently guarantors under our outstanding 5.375% senior notes due 2031 (the “2031
**_Notes”), 4.750% senior notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), 7.0% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) and the 2026 Notes_**
(together with the 2031 Notes, the 2030 Notes and the 2027 Notes, the “existing notes”) and the guarantees related thereto
(collectively, the “existing note **_guarantees”), and initially will be guarantors of the notes. As of the issue date of the notes, it is_**
expected that all of the Company’s subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted subsidiaries) will be
guarantors of the notes. After giving effect to the Refinancing, as of March 31, 2024, the Company’s unrestricted subsidiaries would
have held approximately $883 million of assets.

The notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured first lien basis, by each existing and future subsidiary
of the Company, other than any subsidiary of the Company that does not guarantee the Senior Credit Agreement or any permitted
refinancing thereof. The notes will be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our
subsidiaries that are not guarantors under the notes. The indenture governing the notes will also allow any non-guarantor subsidiaries
that may be designated in the future to incur certain additional indebtedness in the future. Any right that the Company or the
guarantors have to receive any assets of any of the non-guarantor subsidiaries upon the liquidation or reorganization of those
subsidiaries, and the consequent rights of holders of the notes to realize proceeds from the sale of any of those subsidiaries’ assets, will
be effectively subordinated to the claims of those non-guarantor subsidiaries’ creditors, including trade creditors and holders of
preferred equity interests of those subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, or reorganization of any of the
non-guarantor subsidiaries, such non-guarantor subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debts, holders of their preferred equity
interests, and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company or the guarantors. While all
of our subsidiaries will be guarantors (other than subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted subsidiaries), we may have
additional non-guarantor subsidiaries in the future. See “Description of Notes — Subsidiary Guarantees.”

In addition, certain assets that are excluded from the Collateral that will secure the notes and the guarantees may be pledged
to secure other indebtedness. See “Description of Notes.” Consequently, our obligations under the notes and the guarantees are
effectively subordinated to other indebtedness that is secured by assets not constituting Collateral that will secure the notes to the
extent of the value of such assets (including the assets sold to the Receivables SPV pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement). As a
result, if the value of the Collateral pledged as security for the notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the notes,
those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of our unsecured creditors are paid.

**_A court could void the notes, our subsidiaries’ guarantees of the notes, and the related security interests under fraudulent transfer_**
**_or conveyance laws._**

Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of the
guarantees of the notes and the related security interests. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent
transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or the guarantees thereof and the related grant of the
security interests could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the
notes, incurred the guarantee or granted the security interests with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b)
received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes, incurring the guarantee or
granting the security interests and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

12


-----

    - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, was or were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the
notes, the incurrence of the guarantee or the grant of the security interests;

    - the issuance of the notes, the incurrence of the guarantee or the grant of the security interests left us or any of the
guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business as engaged in
or contemplated; or

    - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such
guarantor’s ability to pay as such debts mature.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is
transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee and the grant of the security interests to the extent we or such
guarantor did not obtain a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes. Specifically, if the guarantees were legally
challenged, it may be asserted (and a court may consequently determine) that the guarantors incurred their guarantees for our benefit
and did not themselves receive a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes, such that they incurred the obligations under
the guarantees for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the
guarantees (and any related liens) or security interests, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action
detrimental to the holders of the notes.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations varies depending on the law of the jurisdiction that is
being applied in any such proceeding, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not
we or any of the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions that we and the
guarantors are not insolvent or will not be rendered insolvent as a result of the issuance of the notes and the guarantees, regardless of
the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments
to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other
grounds; or that the issuance of the notes, the guarantees or the grant of the security interests would not be voided or otherwise
subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on
its existing debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

Each guarantee and security interest will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum
amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee and security interest to be a fraudulent
transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees or the security interests from being voided under fraudulent
transfer or conveyance law. To the extent that any of the guarantees or security interests is voided, then, as to that subsidiary, the
guarantee nor the grant of the security interests will be enforceable.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes, the incurrence of a guarantee or the grant of a security interest was a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes, that guarantee or that grant of security
interest, could subordinate the notes, that guarantee or that grant of security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of
ours or of the related guarantor or could require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee
or that security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any
repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’
other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.

In addition, any payment by us under the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee or security interest made at a time that we
or such guarantor were to be found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for
the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy
filing or within 90 days for any non-insider party and such payment would give such insider or non-insider party more than such
creditor would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of
equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the notes to other claims against us under the principle of
equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holders of notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the
inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of notes and
(3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_We may be unable to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

13


-----

Upon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, we will be required to offer to repurchase the notes in
cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A change of control will
also constitute an event of default under our Senior Credit Agreement that will permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the
borrowings thereunder and may trigger similar rights under our other indebtedness then outstanding. Our Senior Credit Agreement
may prohibit us from repurchasing any notes. The failure to repurchase the notes would result in an event of default under the notes. In
the event of a change of control, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all of the notes and to repay the amounts outstanding
under our Senior Credit Agreement or other indebtedness.

**_We cannot be sure that a market for the notes will develop or continue._**

We cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any trading market for the notes;

    - your ability to sell your notes; or

    - the price at which you may be able to sell your notes.

The notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for
similar securities and other factors, including general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and
prospects for companies in our industry generally. In addition, the liquidity of any trading market in the notes and the market prices
quoted for the notes may be adversely affected by changes in the overall market for high-yield securities.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the notes as permitted by
applicable law. They are not obligated, however, to make a market in the notes and any such market-making may be discontinued at
any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. As a result, you cannot be sure that an active trading market will develop or be
sustained for the notes. The lack of any such trading market may adversely affect the trading prices of the notes.

**_Key covenants of the indenture governing the notes will be suspended if the notes achieve investment grade ratings._**

Most of the restrictive covenants in the indenture will not apply during any period in which the notes have investment grade
ratings from any two of Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Fitch Ratings, Inc. or any other
nationally recognized statistical rating organization. At such time, we may take actions such as incur additional debt or make certain
dividends or distributions that would otherwise be prohibited under the indenture. Such prior actions will be permitted even if we later
become subject again to the restrictive covenants. Ratings are given by these rating agencies based upon analyses that include many
subjective factors. We cannot assure you that the notes will achieve or maintain investment grade ratings, nor can we assure you that
investment grade ratings, if granted, will reflect all of the factors that would be important to holders of the notes. See “Description of
Notes — Certain Covenants.”

**_Holders of the notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the notes under applicable_**
**_securities laws._**

There will be restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the notes without registration under applicable securities laws.
The notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under U.S. and applicable state securities laws, and
we do not currently intend to register the notes or guarantees. The holders of the notes will not be entitled to require us to register the
notes for resale or otherwise. Because you may transfer or resell the notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or
exempt from the registration requirements of U.S. and applicable state securities laws, you may be required to bear the risk of your
investment for an indefinite period of time. By purchasing the notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgements,
representations and agreements to this effect as set forth under “Notice to Investors.”

**_An adverse rating on the notes may cause their trading price to fall._**

We are seeking to have the notes rated by securities ratings agencies. It is possible that any initial rating may be lower than
expected. Ratings agencies may lower their ratings on the notes in the future. If rating agencies assign a lower-than-expected rating or
reduce, or indicate that they may reduce, their ratings in the future, the trading price of the notes could significantly decline.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes (after taking into_**
**_account all of other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis)._**

By its nature, some or all of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. The value of
the assets pledged as Collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, competition

14


-----

or other future trends. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the issuance of the notes and the
value of the Collateral at any time is subject to fluctuations that will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the
availability of suitable buyers for the Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no
assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral (or other consideration or currency provided in
connection with claims relating to the Collateral during or as a result of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency or reorganization
proceeding) will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other
obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis), in full or at all, after first satisfying our obligations in full under
claims that are effectively senior to the notes, if any. Moreover, the lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement will share the
proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage. There also can be no
assurance that the Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there
may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if
any, realized by the holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other
obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s
and the guarantors’ senior unsecured indebtedness and other unsecured obligations, including trade and other payables.

In addition, in any U.S. bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that we, as debtor in
possession, any trustee in bankruptcy, or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the
notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing is less than the then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our and the guarantor’s
other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis. In the event that the notes were under-collateralized at the time of such
Collateral valuation (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis), the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim in an_
amount equal to the value of the Collateral and an unsecured claim with respect to the remainder of its claim, which would not be
entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. The consequences of such under-collateralization would include, among other
things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, including attorneys’ fees,
expenses, and costs, and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under
U.S. bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at any time prior to such a finding of
under-collateralization, those payments would be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the
secured claim with respect to the notes.

Thus, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount
of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, including the Senior Credit
Agreement (and any future pari passu obligations) interest, fees, and expenses would cease to accrue on the notes from and after the
date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you
that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral (or other consideration or currency provided in connection with claims
relating to the Collateral during or as a result of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency or reorganization proceeding) will be sufficient to
pay the obligations due under the notes (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other obligations that are secured by the
Collateral on a pari passu basis). Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or other court of competent jurisdiction were to
determine that the obligations in connection with the notes are unenforceable, subordinated, not subject to valid perfected security
interests or intervening security interests, then the value of the Collateral may be impaired to the extent of such ruling with respect to
the notes.

The Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining
third party consents and making additional filings, including as discussed in “—The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon
and sell the Collateral after an event of default has occurred may also be subject to limitations under the Communications Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Communications Act”) and the regulations under the FCC”. If we fail to obtain these consents or make these filings,
the security interests may not be perfected and the holders will not be entitled to realize on the Collateral or any recovery with respect
thereto. We cannot assure any holder of the notes that any such required consents can be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These
requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of
which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the
Collateral by the Collateral Agent, subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, may, without the appropriate consents and filings,
be limited.

The indenture will also permit the Company and the guarantors to create or suffer to exist additional liens on the Collateral,
including liens on excluded property, under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens
securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further limit the recovery from the realization of or foreclosure on the
Collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes. See “Description of Notes — Certain Covenants — Limitation on Liens.”

**_The terms of the notes permit, without the consent of the holders of the notes, various releases of the Collateral securing the notes_**
**_and guarantees that could be adverse to holders of the notes._**

15


-----

There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the notes under which the Collateral securing the notes will be
released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Collateral Agent or the Trustee and the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement will permit, without consent of holders of notes or the Collateral Agent, changes with respect to who controls actions with
respect to the Collateral, that could be adverse to the holders of the notes. Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the
notes and the guarantees will be released, including:

    - upon a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral (other than to the Issuer or a Guarantor) in a transaction not
prohibited under the indenture;

    - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantees;

    - designation of a guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary; and

    - pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in the event the Controlling Collateral Agent (as defined in the First
Lien Intercreditor Agreement) is exercising remedies with respect to the Collateral.

**_Even though the holders of the notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Collateral, the Administrative Agent will initially_**
**_control actions with respect to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the notes with respect to the Collateral that will secure the notes on a first-priority basis will be
subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis,
including the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and the notes offered hereby (and any future pari passu obligations).
Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to any Collateral, including the ability to
cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such Collateral or to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive
direction of the “Controlling Collateral Agent”, which on the issue date will be the Administrative Agent. The “Major NonControlling Authorized Representative” will be (1) at any time when the Administrative Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the
authorized representative for the holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness (other than the obligations
under the Senior Credit Agreement) secured by a first-priority lien on the Collateral and (2) at any time when the Administrative
Agent is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, the authorized representative for the holders of the then largest outstanding principal
amount of indebtedness (including the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement) secured by a first-priority lien on the
Collateral. In the event that (1) our obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement are discharged (which discharge does not include
certain refinancings of the Senior Credit Agreement) or (2) an event of default has occurred and is continuing under any agreement
governing first lien obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (other than the Credit Agreement) for 150
consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 150 day period the authorized representative for the holders of such obligations was
the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and which period will be extended if the Controlling Collateral Agent has
commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the Collateral or at any time
we or a guarantor is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) and
satisfaction of certain other conditions and the authorized representative for such obligations has delivered a notice to all other
authorized representatives and collateral agents thereunder certifying as such and that such first lien obligations are due and payable,
then the right to direct such actions will pass to the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative. Accordingly, the Trustee, the
Collateral Agent, and the holders of the notes may never have the right to control (or direct the control of) remedies and take (or
direct) other actions with respect to the Collateral.

In addition, under the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent
forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the notes on such
Collateral will be automatically released and discharged and the proceeds thereof applied in accordance with the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral so released will no longer secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the notes and the
guarantees. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement also prohibits the Trustee and the Collateral Agent from objecting following the
filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed use of cash collateral by us or “debtor-in-possession” financing to be provided to us to be
secured by such Collateral unless the Controlling Collateral Agent objects thereto (provided that certain conditions with respect
thereto are satisfied).

Also, under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the notes obtain possession of any
Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other
obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or
payment in trust for the other holders of such other obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement for distribution in
accordance with the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations secured on
a pari passu basis by such Collateral. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the holders
of the notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of such obligations subject to such First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement certain funds they may receive.

16


-----

**_Intervening creditors may have a perfected security interest in the Collateral and/or a security interest in the Collateral with a_**
**_higher priority than the liens securing the notes._**

The Collateral securing the Senior Credit Agreement and the notes is subject to liens permitted under the terms of the Credit
Agreement and the indenture, whether arising before, on or after the date the notes are issued. There is a risk that there may be a
creditor whose liens are permitted under the Credit Agreement or the indenture or other intervening creditor that has a security interest
in the Collateral securing the notes, and if there is such an intervening creditor, the lien of such creditor, whether or not permitted
under the Credit Agreement or the indenture may be entitled to a higher priority than the liens securing the notes. The existence of
any liens securing intervening creditors, including liens permitted under the Credit Agreement or the indenture and incurred or
perfected prior to the liens securing the notes (or which may be otherwise entitled to a lien with a higher priority than the liens
securing the notes), could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the notes as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent
for the notes to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. We cannot assure holders of the notes that no intervening creditors exist.

The Collateral will also be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
by the Credit Agreement or the indenture. Any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral that will secure the notes and the guarantees as well as the ability of the Collateral Agent for the notes
to realize or foreclose on the Collateral for the benefit of holders of the notes.

**_The ability of the holders of the notes to exercise remedies against the equity interests of certain of the Company’s or a guarantor’s_**
**_foreign subsidiaries pledged as Collateral may be limited by the laws of the jurisdictions of organization of these foreign_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Part of the security for the repayment of the notes consists of a pledge of up to 65% of the voting equity interests and 100%
of the non-voting equity interests of first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”) that may be owned
by us or a guarantor. We currently do not have any foreign subsidiaries that are CFCs but could create such entities in the future. Some
or all of the equity pledges relating to the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries will be governed by the laws of their country of
organization, and these laws may be significantly different than the laws of the United States. The Collateral Agent may not be able to
enforce the security interest in any such equity pledges in the same manner and on as timely of a basis as a pledge of the capital stock
of a U.S. entity. The implementation and the perfection of an equity pledge may be subject to local law, and failure of the Collateral
Agent to comply with local requirements may result in a pledge not being effective. We will only be required to deliver security
documents granting a security interest in the capital stock of certain first tier foreign subsidiaries which are governed by the laws of
their country of organization to the extent the same is delivered to the Administrative Agent in accordance with the terms of the Senior
Credit Agreement. In addition, the lien of the Collateral Agent in such capital stock will be created pursuant to security documents and
perfected in a manner that may give it as a matter of law, junior priority to the rights of the Administrative Agent. In such cases,
holders of the notes will have to rely on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement to provide first-priority liens on such capital stock
subject to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be. As a result, the first-priority lien of the holders of the notes
with respect to such capital stock will be dependent on the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, which will provide that the rights of the
holders of the notes with respect to the capital stock are secured on a first-priority basis. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may
not be recognized in certain jurisdictions.

**_We will, in most cases, retain control over the Collateral._**

Until the occurrence and continuation of an event of default, the security documents generally allow the Company and the
guarantors to remain in possession of and retain control over, to operate, and to collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the
Collateral with certain limited exceptions. Therefore, the pool of assets constituting the Collateral will change from time to time, and
its fair market value may decrease from its value on the date the notes are originally issued.

**_Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain Collateral. Even_**
**_if such security interests are perfected, it may not be practicable for a holder of the notes to enforce or economically benefit from_**
**_their rights with respect to such security interests._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly perfected and its
priority retained only through the taking of certain actions. The security interests of holders of the notes will not be perfected with
respect to certain items of Collateral that cannot be perfected by the filing of financing statements or the filing of a notice of security
interest with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the U.S. Copyright Office or subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
by delivery of any certificated equity or notes representing pledged Collateral to the Collateral Agent (or its bailee) together with any
proper endorsements executed in blank or by delivery of control agreements with respect to certain deposit accounts and securities
accounts (and our obligation to obtain such control agreements will discharge if we fail to deliver them after using commercially
reasonable efforts). To the extent that the security interests in any portion of the Collateral are unperfected, the liens securing the

17


-----

notes and guarantees may be avoided in a bankruptcy and, if avoided, the rights of holders of the notes with respect to such Collateral
will be equal to the rights of our general unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filed by or against us under applicable U.S.
federal bankruptcy laws.

In addition, the security interest of the Collateral Agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the
realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, we may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional
filings for certain types of Collateral. If we fail to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and
the holders of the notes will not be entitled to realize on the Collateral or any recovery with respect to the Collateral. Furthermore, the
consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral
Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Under the
terms of the security documents related to the notes, we are also not required to obtain third party consents with respect to certain
categories of Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor Collateral Agent has any obligation to obtain such consents or make any filings with
respect to the Collateral.

In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest or
lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Company and the guarantors have
limited obligations to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the notes in specified Collateral. The Trustee and
the Collateral Agent will not monitor the Collateral, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the Collateral
Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly
perfect the lien on such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the
acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral, to monitor the perfection of any security interests therein or to
make any filings or recordings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any of the security interests. Such failure to perfect the security
interest may result in the loss of the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the notes against third
parties. Even if the liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable
as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge or perfection of a lien on
Collateral or future guarantee might be avoidable in bankruptcy or in a state law or other proceeding.”

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, security interests created over particular assets can only be perfected by possession or
“control” of the asset by the secured party. The terms of the security documents may not require possession or “control” be granted to
the secured party, meaning that the security interest will remain unperfected until possession or “control” is granted.

**_There are certain categories of property that are excluded from the Collateral securing the notes._**

The assets securing the notes and the related guarantees are limited to certain of our assets and the assets of the guarantors.
Certain categories of assets are excluded from the Collateral and the guarantees. See “Description of Notes — Collateral and
Security.” Excluded assets include, but are not limited to, (i) any license or authorization issued by the FCC or any successor or
similar regulatory authority to the extent that the granting of a security interest therein is prohibited under applicable law, (ii) assets
subject to a certificate of title statute to the extent that a security interest in such assets cannot under such statute obtain priority over
the rights of a lien creditor without such security interest being indicated on the applicable certificate of title, (iii) certain deposit
accounts and securities accounts and (iv) the capital stock of certain subsidiaries, including voting equity interests in subsidiaries that
are CFC holding companies or first-tier foreign subsidiaries that are CFCs, in each case, in excess of 65% of the issued and
outstanding voting equity interests of such subsidiaries.

**_Any future pledge or perfection of a lien on Collateral or future guarantee might be avoidable in bankruptcy or in a state law or_**
**_other proceeding._**

Collateral pledged or guarantees issued after the issue date of the notes may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were
pledged to secure, or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge of Collateral or grant
of a security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent for the notes, including security documents delivered after the date of the
indenture, or any guarantee delivered in the future might be avoidable by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its
trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially our other creditors) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if
the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or guarantee, the pledge or guarantee permits the holders of the notes to
receive a greater recovery than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or
guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or guarantee (or one year if the creditor that benefited from the pledge or
guarantor is an “insider” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). The same risk applies to perfection of a lien within the applicable period
in connection with a pledge granted prior to the commencement of such period. Such pledges, perfection, and guarantee may also be
avoidable in a state law or other proceeding, subject to the timeframes and other terms of applicable law.

18


-----

Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date of the notes and any pledge of
collateral not pledged, or any guarantees not issued, on the issue date of the notes had been pledged or perfected or issued (as
applicable) less than 90 days (or potentially a longer period in the case of any insiders) before the commencement of such bankruptcy
proceeding, such pledges or guarantees are materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if
delivered on the issue date of the notes (even if the other guarantees or liens (as applicable) issued on the issue date of the notes would
no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of any such security interest and/or guarantee is avoided as a preference
or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest and/or guarantee (as applicable).

**_Rights of holders of the notes would generally be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings._**

If a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us, the ability of holders of the notes to collect on the notes would
generally be significantly impaired. A bankruptcy case may be commenced by us or by certain unsecured or undersecured creditors as
provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The right of the Collateral Agent (and as to the extent permitted under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) to repossess
and dispose of the Collateral securing the notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired (and at a minimum likely
delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to, or possibly even after, the
Collateral Agent for the notes has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the “automatic stay”
prohibits a secured creditor, such as the Collateral Agent for the notes, from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy
case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may be denied under
the particular facts and circumstances). Moreover, applicable bankruptcy law and/or the bankruptcy court generally permit the debtor
to continue to retain and to use Collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the Collateral,
even if the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.”

The meaning of the term “adequate protection” is undefined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and may vary according to
circumstances (and is within discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is generally intended to protect the value of a secured creditor’s
interest in its collateral from diminution as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor
during the pendency of the bankruptcy case and may include periodic cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement
security of such type, at such times, and in such amount if and as the court in its discretion, may determine, for any diminution in the
value of such creditor’s collateral as a result of the automatic stay or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the
bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy court has broad discretionary powers in all these matters, including the valuation of the collateral
and the nature, accessibility or value of any other Collateral that may be substituted for it. A bankruptcy court could conclude that a
secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is “adequately protected” against any diminution in value during the bankruptcy case
without the need of providing any additional protection, and, among other things, a bankruptcy court may determine that a secured
creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it
secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate
protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a
bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent for the notes could
repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter, or
whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral
through the requirement of “adequate protection” or otherwise.

Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the holders of the
notes would be “undersecured.” Federal bankruptcy laws generally do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses,
costs and fees during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to a creditor holding “undersecured” claims; nor is a creditor entitled to adequate
protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims.

In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, the following factors, among others, might bear on recoveries by holders of the
notes:

    - a debtor in a bankruptcy case does not have the ability to compel performance of a “financial accommodation,” including
the funding of any undrawn loans that might be contemplated to fund operations;

    - the bankruptcy court may approve debtor-in-possession financing that may be required to be repaid before secured and
other creditors are paid or that may be secured by liens on the Collateral that are granted a higher priority than those liens
securing the notes;

    - lenders with higher priority liens or other secured creditors may seek, and perhaps receive, relief from the automatic stay
to foreclose on their respective liens; and

19


-----

    - the cost, delay, and procedures of bankruptcy, including potentially pursuing a reorganization plan, could affect
operations, revenues, and the value available for creditors.

Moreover, in a bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court would have broad discretion to approve transactions (such as
those outside of the ordinary course of business) and otherwise take actions that could disadvantage the holders of the notes. Among
other things, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case would require prior permission from the bankruptcy court
(which may be denied under the particular facts and circumstances). Accordingly, there can be no assurances, pending or following
the completion of such a proceeding, with respect to the following, among other things: whether and when any payments under the
notes would be made (or the length of the delay in making any such payments); whether the terms and conditions of the notes or any
rights of the holders of the notes would be altered or ignored without the consent of holders of notes (including potentially under a
plan of reorganization which, under certain circumstances as set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, may be confirmed over the dissent
of the holders of the notes); whether holders of the notes would be able to enforce their rights against the guarantors under their
guarantees; and whether and to what extent holders of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or receive any payment
at all.

Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a bankruptcy court could order substantive consolidation of the Company or a
guarantor with one or more of their affiliates or subsidiaries (even those that themselves are not then a debtor under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code). We believe that the Company and the guarantors have observed and will observe certain formalities and operating
procedures that are generally recognized requirements for maintaining their respective separate existences, and that their respective
assets and liabilities can be readily identified as distinct from each other’s and from those of their affiliates and subsidiaries.

We cannot assure holders of the notes, however, that a bankruptcy court would agree. If a bankruptcy court concludes that
substantive consolidation of the Company or a guarantor with any affiliate or subsidiary is warranted, holders of the notes should
expect that any payments on account of their claims may be delayed and/or reduced and that the creditors of such other consolidated
entities would assert a claim with respect to the Collateral. Also, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide
that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the notes will be subject to various restrictions with respect to their ability to object to
certain matters or to take other actions following the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to the Collateral prior to the discharge
of the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement (including with respect to our use of cash collateral or obtaining debtor-inpossession financing secured by the Collateral that satisfy certain express condition).

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks or risks beyond our control._**

We intend to maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards in a manner appropriate for our business. There
are, however, losses with respect to the Collateral that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. As a result, we cannot
assure you that the insurance proceeds will compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the Collateral,
we cannot assure holders of the notes that any insurance proceeds received by us will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured
obligations, including the obligations under the notes and the related guarantees.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the notes will reveal any or all existing liens on
such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens
securing the notes and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral
securing the notes.

**_Security over certain Collateral will not be in place at closing, will not be perfected on the closing date of this offering and may be_**
**_invalidated or avoided following closing._**

Certain security interests will neither be in place nor perfected on the closing date of this offering. To the extent any security
interest in the Collateral cannot be or is not otherwise perfected on or prior to the closing date of this offering, the indenture will
require us to use commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected to the extent required by the indenture
and the security documents within 120 days following the issue date. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date may be treated
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. To the extent a security interest
in certain Collateral is perfected following the closing date of this offering, that security interest would remain at risk of having been a
preference (in which case it might be voided in bankruptcy) if granted within 90 days of a bankruptcy filing by the Company or the
guarantors (or potentially a longer period). Accordingly, if the Company or a guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection and the
liens had been perfected less than 90 days (or potentially a longer period) before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding,
or not yet perfected at all, the liens securing the notes may be subject to challenge as a preferential transfer or otherwise as a result of

20


-----

having not been perfected before the closing date of this offering. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, you would lose the
benefit of the security that such Collateral was intended to provide.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness**

**_We have substantial debt and have the ability to incur significant additional debt. The principal and interest payment obligations_**
**_on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations._**

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we and the guarantors would have had approximately $6.2
billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany debt and before deducting deferred
financing costs), all of which would have constituted senior debt (including the notes), and of which approximately $3.3 billion
(including the notes), and an additional $580 million undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding
approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit), would have been secured by substantially all of the assets of us and the
guarantors.

Our substantial debt may have important consequences to you. For instance, it could:

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due
under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures,
acquisitions and investments;

    - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to
capital resources;

    - limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other
general corporate purposes; and

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the notes.

Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is
partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We
cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, that future borrowings will be available to us under our
Senior Credit Agreement or any other credit facilities, or that we will be able to complete any necessary financings, in amounts
sufficient to enable us to fund our operations or pay our debts and other obligations, or to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able
to generate sufficient cash flow to service our obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or
delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. Additional debt or equity financing may not be available in sufficient
amounts, at times or on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Specifically, volatility in the capital markets may also impact our ability to
obtain additional financing, or to refinance our existing debt, on terms or at times favorable to us. If we are unable to implement one
or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt or other obligations, which could result in us being in default
thereon, in which circumstances our lenders could cease making loans to us, and lenders or other holders of our debt could accelerate
and declare due all outstanding obligations due under the respective agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on us.

**_Despite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further_**
**_exacerbate the risks associated with our leverage._**

Subject to our ability to meet certain conditions, the Senior Credit Agreement, the terms of the indenture to be entered into in
connection with the issuance of the notes and the indentures governing our outstanding existing notes (as supplemented, the “existing
**_indentures”) also permit us to incur additional indebtedness, some of which may be secured.  Although the Credit Agreement that_**
governs the Senior Credit Agreement and the existing indentures contain, and the indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence
of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness
incurred in compliance with these qualifications and exceptions could be substantial. Upon consummation of this offering, we expect
to have capacity to incur additional indebtedness, which could be in the form of additional senior secured indebtedness. As of March
31, 2024, we had $619 million of additional borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility. As of March 31, 2024, on an as adjusted
basis for the Refinancing, our maximum available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility would have been $580
million (excluding approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit).

If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes and the guarantees thereof, the holders of that
indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any
insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of the Company. Further, subject to the restrictions in the
Credit Agreement that governs the Senior Credit Agreement and the indenture, we also will have the ability to incur additional senior

21


-----

secured indebtedness, which may also be guaranteed by the guarantors and may be secured by a first-priority senior secured lien on
the Collateral ranking equally with the lien securing the notes and the guarantees.

**_The agreements governing our various debt obligations impose restrictions on our operations and limit our ability to undertake_**
**_certain corporate actions._**

The agreements governing our various debt obligations, including the existing indentures, the indenture that will govern the
notes and the agreements governing our Senior Credit Agreement, include and will include covenants imposing significant restrictions
on our operations. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of
potential business opportunities as they arise. These covenants place, or will place, restrictions on our ability to, among other things:

    - incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations;

    - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;

    - make investments or acquisitions;

    - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions;

    - issue guarantees;

    - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets;

    - amend our articles of incorporation or bylaws;

    - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

    - purchase, sell or transfer certain assets.

Any of these restrictions and limitations could make it more difficult for us to execute our business strategy.

**_The existing indentures and our Senior Credit Agreement also require, and the indenture governing the notes will require, us to_**
**_comply with certain financial ratios and covenants; our failure to do so would result in a default thereunder, which would have a_**
**_material adverse effect on us._**

We are required to comply with certain financial or other covenants under the existing indentures and our Senior Credit
Agreement and will be required to comply with certain covenants under the indenture governing the notes. Our ability to comply with
these requirements may be affected by events affecting our business, but beyond our control, including prevailing general economic,
financial and industry conditions. These covenants could have an adverse effect on us by limiting our ability to take advantage of
financing, investment, acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in
a default under the existing indentures, our Senior Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the notes.

Upon a default under any of our debt agreements, the lenders or debtholders thereunder could have the right to declare all
amounts outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable, which could, in turn, trigger
defaults under other debt obligations and could result in the termination of commitments of the lenders to make further extensions of
credit under our Senior Credit Agreement. If we were unable to repay our secured debt to our lenders, or were otherwise in default
under any provision governing our outstanding secured debt obligations, our secured lenders could proceed against us and the
subsidiary guarantors and against the collateral securing that debt. Any default resulting in an acceleration of outstanding
indebtedness, a termination of commitments under our financing arrangements or lenders proceeding against the collateral securing
such indebtedness would likely result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our annual debt service obligations to increase_**
**_significantly._**

Borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If the rates
on which our borrowings are based were to increase from current levels, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness
would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available to service our other
obligations, including making payments on the notes, would decrease.

To partially mitigate this risk, we have entered into interest rate caps pursuant to an International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Master Agreement with two counterparties. The interest rate caps protect us against adverse fluctuations in
interest rates by reducing our exposure to variability in cash flows on a portion of our variable-rate debt. At March 31, 2024, our
interest rate caps had a combined notional value of approximately $2.6 billion. The interest rate caps effectively limit the annual

22


-----

interest charged on our Senior Credit Agreement’s current term loans to a maximum of one-month Term SOFR of 4.96% and 5.047%.
We are required to pay aggregate fees in connection with the interest rate caps of approximately $34 million that is due and payable at
maturity on December 31, 2025. In 2023, we received $4 million of cash payments from the counterparties that we reclassify to reduce
interest expense from the interest rate caps in our consolidated statement of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result_**
**_of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control._**

Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends
on, among other things:

    - economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole;

    - the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations;

    - changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located;

    - local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity
of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising;

    - our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital
platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies;

    - the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason;

    - decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason;

    - the competitiveness of local, regional, and federal elections and ballot initiatives;

    - labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and

    - other factors beyond our control.

Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and
broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is
primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth
quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue
and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for
various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often
significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue
earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by
our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically
derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 2% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If
political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial
condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games
and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of
our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income
during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our
revenue and results of operations.

**_Continued uncertain financial and economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations or_**
**_financial condition._**

Financial and economic conditions continue to be uncertain over the longer term and the continuation or worsening of such
conditions could reduce consumer confidence and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial
condition. If consumer confidence were to decline, this decline could negatively affect our advertising customers’ businesses and their
advertising budgets. In addition, volatile economic conditions could have a negative impact on our industry or the industries of our
customers who advertise on our stations, resulting in reduced advertising sales. Furthermore, it may be possible that actions taken by
any governmental or regulatory body for the purpose of stabilizing the economy or financial markets will not achieve their intended
effect. In addition to any negative direct consequences to our business or results of operations arising from these financial and

23


-----

economic developments, some of these actions may adversely affect financial institutions, capital providers, advertisers or other
consumers on whom we rely, including for access to future capital or financing arrangements necessary to support our business. Our
inability to obtain financing in amounts and at times necessary could make it more difficult or impossible to meet our obligations or
otherwise take actions in our best interests.

**_Our dependence upon a limited number of advertising categories could adversely affect our business._**

We consider broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned primarily from the sale of advertisements broadcast by our
stations. Although no single customer represented more than 5% of our broadcast advertising revenue for the years ended December
31, 2023 and 2022, we derived a material portion of non-political broadcast advertising revenue from advertisers in a limited number
of industries, particularly the services sector, comprising financial, legal and medical advertisers, and the automotive industry. The
services sector has become an increasingly important source of advertising revenue over the past few years. During the years ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 approximately 27%, 28% and 29%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding
political advertising revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to the services sector. During the years ended December 31, 2023,
2022 and 2021 approximately 20%, 17% and 17%, respectively, of our broadcast advertising revenue (excluding political advertising
revenue) was obtained from advertising sales to automotive customers. Our results of operations and financial condition could be
materially adversely affected if broadcast advertising revenue from the services sector, automotive or certain other industries, such as
the medical, restaurant, communications, or furniture and appliances industries, declined.

**_We intend to continue to evaluate growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions, and there are significant risks associated_**
**_with an acquisition strategy._**

We intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for growth through selective acquisitions of television stations or station
groups, subject to our commitment to reducing our leverage ratio over time. There can be no assurances that we will be able to
identify any suitable acquisition candidates, and we cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing or completing any
acquisitions, or what the consequences of not completing any acquisitions would be. Consummation of any proposed acquisition at
any time may also be subject to various conditions such as compliance with FCC rules and policies. Consummation of acquisitions
may also be subject to antitrust or other regulatory requirements. In addition, as we operate in a highly regulated industry, we could be
subject to litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions on a variety of matters, the result of which could limit our
acquisition strategy.

An acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:

    - identifying suitable acquisition candidates and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms;

    - integrating operations and systems and managing a large and geographically diverse group of stations;

    - obtaining financing to complete acquisitions, which financing may not be available to us at times, in amounts, or at rates
acceptable to us, if at all, and potentially the related risks associated with increased debt;

    - diverting our management’s attention from other business concerns;

    - potentially losing key employees; and

    - potential changes in the regulatory approval process that may make it materially more expensive, or materially delay our
ability, to consummate any proposed acquisitions.


Our failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or to complete any acquisitions and integrate any acquired business, or
to obtain the expected benefits therefrom, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may fail to realize any benefits and incur unanticipated losses related to any acquisition._**

The success of any strategic acquisition depends, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the acquired business and
assets with our business and our ability to successfully manage the assets so acquired. It is possible that the integration process could
result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and
policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated
benefits of an acquisition. Successful integration may also be hampered by any differences between the operations and corporate
culture of the two organizations. Additionally, general market and economic conditions may inhibit our successful integration of any
business. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of an acquisition may not be realized fully,
or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues

24


-----

from the acquired business, any assets or operations disposed of in connection therewith or otherwise, or charges to earnings in
connection with such acquisitions.

**_We must purchase television programming in advance of knowing whether a particular show will be popular enough for us to_**
**_recoup our costs._**

One of our most significant costs is for the purchase of television programming. If a particular program is not sufficiently
popular among audiences in relation to the cost we pay for such program, we may not be able to sell enough related advertising time
for us to recover the costs we pay to broadcast the program. We also must usually purchase programming several years in advance,
and we may have to commit to purchase more than one year’s worth of programming, resulting in the incurrence of significant costs in
advance of our receipt of any related revenue. We may also replace programs that are performing poorly before we have recaptured
any significant portion of the costs we incurred in obtaining such programming or fully expensed the costs for financial reporting
purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues, result in the incurrence of impairment charges, or otherwise cause our costs
to escalate relative to revenues.

**_We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a_**
**_network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation_**
**_agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation_**
**_agreement._**

Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. One or more stations in each of our operating
markets are affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to individual affiliation agreements. Each
affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network
during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates between year-end 2024 and
January 1, 2026 (with respect to Big Four networks). See “Business — Markets and Stations” incorporated by reference into this
offering memorandum for additional information on all of our affiliation agreements and their respective expiration dates.

If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be
able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to create and/or obtain replacement
programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby
reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On the
other hand, replacement programming may provide additional advertising inventory than that provided to affiliated stations by their
networks. Our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business
relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC.

If we are able to renew or replace existing affiliation agreements, we can give no assurance that any future affiliation
agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the
future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect
on our business and results of operations.

In addition, if we are unable to renew or replace any existing affiliation agreements, we may be unable to satisfy certain
obligations under our existing or any future retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs and/or secure payment of retransmission
consent fees under such agreements. Furthermore, if in the future a network limited or removed our ability to retransmit network
programming to MVPDs, we may be unable to satisfy certain obligations or criteria for fees under any existing or any future
retransmission consent agreements. In either case, such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of
operations.

**_We are also dependent upon our retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs, and we cannot predict the outcome of potential_**
**_regulatory changes to the retransmission consent regime._**

We are also dependent, in significant part, on our retransmission consent agreements. Our current retransmission consent
agreements expire at various times over the next several years. No assurances can be provided that we will be able to renegotiate all of
such agreements on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or
regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated.

-----

The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the
carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to
ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint
retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly
controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals
that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from
deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods.

We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our
television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot
predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities.

The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated
exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our
program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our
ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming.

In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet
without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining
these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to
classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to
negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its
proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs.

In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the
Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the “TVPA of 2019”). Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright
license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of
network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all
DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was
defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or
multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters
and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate
retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with
a qualified MVPD buying group.

Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming.
Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would
weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will
become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business.

**_We may be unable to maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business and operating results._**

We generate a meaningful portion of our advertising revenue from the sale of advertisements on our digital platforms and
through the sale of inventory on digital platforms owned by third parties. Our ability to maintain and increase this advertising revenue
is largely dependent upon the number of users actively visiting the internet sites, digital apps, and platforms and our arrangements that
allow us to sell and service such inventory. Because digital advertising techniques are evolving, if our content, technology and/or
advertisement-serving techniques do not evolve to meet the changing needs of advertisers, our advertising revenue could decline.
Changes in our business model, advertising inventory or initiatives could also cause a decrease in our digital advertising revenue.

We do not have long-term agreements with most of our digital advertisers. Any termination, change or decrease in our
relationships with our largest digital advertising clients could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. If we do
not maintain or increase our digital advertising revenue, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially
adversely affected.

**_Cybersecurity incidents impacting our information technology infrastructure or those of our third-party service providers could_**
**_interfere with our operations, compromise client information and expose us to liability, possibly causing our business and_**
**_reputation to suffer._**

26


-----

We rely on technology and data owned or controlled by us or our third-party service providers in substantially all aspects of
our business operations. Our revenues are increasingly dependent on digital products and access to systems and data. Such use
exposes us to cybersecurity threats arising from a variety of causes, including from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. These
cybersecurity incidents could include, but are not limited to, unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating
assets or sensitive information, data corruption or operational disruption. If we are subject to a cybersecurity incident, it could result in
business interruption, disclosure of nonpublic information, decreased advertising revenues, misstated financial data, liability for stolen
assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation or investigations, financial consequences and reputational
damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence, among other things, any or all of which could materially adversely affect
our business. While we have experienced a cybersecurity incident in the past, and may experience additional cybersecurity incidents in
the future, we are not aware of any cybersecurity incident having a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or
financial condition to date. However, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future cybersecurity incidents that may be
material. Although we have systems and processes in place to try to protect against risks associated with cybersecurity incidents in the
future, depending on the nature of an cybersecurity incident, these protections may not be fully sufficient. In addition, because
techniques used in cybersecurity threats change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be
unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A cybersecurity incident may not be detected
until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been
discovered.

**_We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition occurs on multiple levels (for audiences, programming and_**
**_advertisers) and is based on a variety of factors. If we are not able to successfully compete in all relevant aspects, our revenues will_**
**_be materially adversely affected._**

Television stations compete for audiences, certain programming (including news) and advertisers. Signal coverage and
carriage on MVPD systems also materially affect a television station’s competitive position. With respect to audiences, stations
compete primarily based on broadcast program popularity. We cannot provide any assurances as to the acceptability by audiences of
any of the programs we broadcast. Further, because we compete with other broadcast stations for certain programming, we cannot
provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain any desired programming at costs that we believe are reasonable. Cable-network
programming, combined with increased access to cable, satellite TV, internet-delivered MVPDs, as well as internet video services
(such as YouTube) and internet streaming channels and services including subscription video on demand and advertising video on
demand have become significant competitors for television programming viewers. Cable networks’ viewership and advertising share
have been declining in recent years, while streaming viewership has accelerated and recently surpassed the combined viewership of
broadcast and cable-network programming combined. Further increases in the advertising share of cable networks, internet video
services, and internet streaming channels and services could materially adversely affect the advertising revenue of our television
stations.

In addition, new technologies and methods of buying advertising present an additional competitive challenge, as competitors
may offer products and services such as the ability to purchase advertising programmatically or bundled offline and online advertising,
aimed at more efficiently capturing advertising spend. The number of viewers and ratings of our television stations and advertising
revenues in general may be impacted by viewers moving to these programming alternatives and alternate media content providers, and
by eliminating or reducing subscriptions to traditional MVPD services (“cord cutting” and “cord shaving,” respectively). As these
programming alternatives continue to drive changes in consumer behavior and other consumption strategies, our business and results
of operations may be materially affected.

Our inability or failure to broadcast popular programs, or otherwise maintain viewership for any reason, including as a result
of increases in programming alternatives, or our loss of advertising due to technological changes, could result in a lessening of
advertisers, or a reduction in the amount advertisers are willing to pay us to advertise, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We recently have incurred impairment charges on our goodwill, other intangible assets and investments. In prior periods we have_**
**_incurred impairment charges on our broadcast licenses. Any such future charges may have a material effect on the value of our_**
**_total assets._**

As of March 31, 2024, the book value of our broadcast licenses was $5.3 billion and the book value of our goodwill was
$2.6 billion, in comparison to total assets of $10.7 billion.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of the bankruptcy of Diamond Sports Group, LLC, our production
companies segment recorded a non-cash charge of $43 million, for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.

27


-----

Also, during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recognized impairment charges of $29 million and $18
million, respectively, related to investments. These impairment charges were recorded upon our determination that the fair value of the
investments had declined on an other-than-temporary basis or that the recorded value was not recoverable.

Not less than annually, and more frequently if necessary, we are required to evaluate our goodwill and broadcast licenses to
determine if the estimated fair value of these intangible assets is less than book value. If the estimated fair value of these intangible
assets is less than book value, we will be required to record a non-cash expense to write down the book value of the intangible asset to
the estimated fair value. We cannot make any assurances that any required impairment charges will not have a material adverse effect
on our total assets.

**_We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash._**

We are a holding company with no material independent assets or operations, other than our investments in our subsidiaries.
Because we are a holding company, we are dependent upon the payment of dividends, distributions, loans or advances to us by our
subsidiaries to fund our obligations. These payments could be or become subject to dividend or other restrictions under applicable
laws in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. Payments by our subsidiaries are also contingent upon the subsidiaries’
earnings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations, our financial condition and ability to
meet our obligations may be materially adversely affected.

**_Our defined benefit pension plan obligations are currently funded, however, if certain factors worsen, we may have to make_**
**_significant cash payments, which could reduce the cash available for our business._**

We have funded obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. Notwithstanding that the Gray Television, Inc.
Retirement Plan and Gray Television, Inc. Retirement Plan for certain Bargaining Class Employees are frozen with regard to any
future benefit accruals, the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets,
the level of certain market interest rates and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on the plan’s
assets or unfavorable changes in applicable laws or regulations may materially change the timing and amount of required plan
funding, which could reduce the cash available for our business. In addition, any future decreases in the discount rate used to
determine pension obligations could result in an increase in the valuation of pension obligations, which could affect the reported
funding status of our pension plans and future contributions.

**_Certain stockholders or groups of stockholders have the ability, and are expected to continue to have the ability, to exert significant_**
**_influence over us._**

Hilton H. Howell, Jr., our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is the husband of Robin R. Howell, a member of
our Board of Directors (collectively with other members of their family, the “Howell-Robinson Family”). As of March 8, 2024,
collectively, the Howell-Robinson Family directly or indirectly beneficially owned shares representing approximately 46.1% of the
outstanding combined voting power of our common stock and Class A common stock.

As a result of these significant stockholdings and positions on the Board of Directors, the Howell-Robinson Family is able to
exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be consistent with the interests
of our debtholders.

**Risks Related to Regulatory Matters**

**_Federal broadcasting industry regulations limit our operating flexibility._**

The FCC regulates all television broadcasters, including us. We must obtain FCC approval whenever we (i) apply for a new
license, (ii) seek to renew, modify or assign a license, (iii) purchase a broadcast station and/or (iv) transfer the control of one of our
subsidiaries that holds a license. Our FCC licenses are critical to our operations, and we cannot operate without them. We cannot be
certain that the FCC will renew these licenses in the future or approve new acquisitions, mergers, divestitures or other business
activities. Our failure to renew any licenses upon the expiration of any license term could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

Federal legislation and FCC rules have changed significantly in recent years and may continue to change. These changes may
limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may affect our operating results.

**_The FCC can sanction us for programming broadcast on our stations that it finds to be indecent._**

28


-----

Over the past several years, the FCC has increased its enforcement efforts regarding broadcast indecency and profanity and
the statutory maximum fine for broadcasting indecent material is nearly $500,000 per incident, up to a maximum of more than $4
million for a continuing violation. In June 2012, the Supreme Court decided a challenge to the FCC’s indecency enforcement policies
without resolving the scope of the FCC’s ability to regulate broadcast content. In August 2013, the FCC issued a Public Notice
seeking comment on whether it should modify its indecency policies. The FCC has not yet issued a decision in this proceeding and the
courts remain free to review the FCC’s current policy or any modifications thereto. The outcomes of these proceedings could affect
future FCC policies in this area, and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such judicial proceeding, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business.

**_The FCC’s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market._**

The FCC’s ownership rules generally prohibit us from acquiring an “attributable interest” in two television stations that are
located in the same market unless at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the “top-four”
prohibition).

In December 2023, the FCC adopted two modifications to the top-four prohibition that make it more restrictive. These rule
changes took effect in March 2024. First, the FCC extended the top-four prohibition to low power television (“LPTV”) stations and
multicast streams. As a result of this change, a licensee will be prohibited from acquiring network-affiliated programming of another
top-four station in a DMA and then placing that programming on either the multicast stream of a full-power station or a LPTV station
in a DMA in which it already owns another top-four rated station. These additional restrictions will apply to transactions entered into
after December 26, 2023. Existing combinations will be grandfathered, but may not be transferred or assigned except in compliance
with the new rule, or a waiver of the new rule. Second, the FCC modified its methodology for determining a station’s audience share
for purposes of the top-four prohibition (and failing station waiver requests) to (i) consider audience share data over a 12-month period
immediately preceding the date the application is filed, (ii) expanding the relevant daypart for audience share data significantly, and
(iii) requiring the inclusion of audience share data for all free-to-consumer, non-simulcast multicast streams.

In November 2022, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order finding that Gray’s acquisition of CBS programming from another
broadcaster in the Anchorage market for Gray’s station KYES-TV was inconsistent with the local television ownership rule’s “topfour” prohibition given Gray’s ownership of KTUU-TV in the same market (a top-four ranked station) and imposed a fine of
$518,283. Gray has brought a judicial challenge to the FCC’s Order, which remains pending.

The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television
station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.”
Pursuant to the FCC’s ownership rules currently in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station
acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained.

**_The FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule limits the maximum number of households we can reach._**

Under the FCC’s National Television Station Ownership Rule, a single television station owner may not reach more than
39% of United States households through commonly owned television stations, subject to a 50% discount of the number of television
households attributable to UHF stations (the “UHF Discount”). In December 2017, the FCC issued an NPRM seeking comment on
whether it should modify or eliminate the national cap, including the UHF Discount. This proceeding remains pending. This rule may
constrain our ability to expand through additional station acquisitions.

**_The Company is subject to governmental oversight regarding compliance with antitrust law as well as related civil litigation._**

Various governmental agencies, including the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), have authority to enforce the antitrust laws of
the United States in the broadcast television industry. The DOJ has increased its enforcement activities within the industry. For
example, in the fourth quarter of 2018, the DOJ filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against
six broadcasters, including Raycom and Meredith, alleging an agreement to exchange certain competitively sensitive information
relating to advertising sales among certain stations in some local markets. The broadcasters and the DOJ entered into substantially
identical consent decrees, each of which, among other things, prohibits the defendant broadcasters from exchanging competitively
sensitive information and imposes certain compliance requirements. No party to the consent decrees, including Raycom and Meredith,
admitted to any wrongdoing. In addition, following the public disclosure of the DOJ’s investigation and consent decrees, various
putative class action lawsuits were filed against a number of owners of television stations. The cases have been consolidated in a
single multidistrict litigation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and the plaintiffs’ operative complaint alleges
price fixing and unlawful information exchange among the defendants’ advertisement sales teams. We are unable to predict the
outcome of the proceeding.

29


-----

**_The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon and sell the Collateral after an event of default has occurred may also be_**
**_subject to limitations under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) and the regulations under_**
**_the FCC._**

Under the Communications Act and implementing rules and regulations of the FCC, the consent of the FCC must be obtained
prior to any change in direct or indirect control of an entity holding licenses issued by the FCC. We and certain of our subsidiaries
hold licenses issued by the FCC. The foreclosure of our capital stock or of the capital stock of our subsidiaries which directly or
indirectly hold such licenses could result in a transfer of control of an entity holding FCC licenses. In the event of default, the
Collateral Agent may be required to obtain the consent of the FCC prior to exercising foreclosure rights or selling the Collateral
securing the notes and the guarantees. This limitation could complicate the ability of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon and sell
the Collateral. We can give no assurance that such consent can be obtained by the Collateral Agent on a timely basis or at all.
Therefore, the practical value of realizing on our capital stock or of the capital stock of our subsidiaries which hold such licenses may,
without the appropriate consents, prior approval of the FCC and related filings, be limited.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and the payment of our
estimated expenses related to this offering, will be approximately $      million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering,
together with the net proceeds of the 2024 Term Loan, availability under our Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand, to (i)
refinance the 2019 Term Loan, (ii) finance the Tender Offer and (iii) pay all fees and expenses in connection with this offering.

Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may be lenders under the 2019 Term Loan and therefore would
receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may hold positions in
the 2026 Notes that we may purchase in the Tender Offer with the net proceeds from this offering, and those entities would receive a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering as tender offer consideration if they tender their 2026 Notes in accordance with the terms
of the Tender Offer.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

_The following description contains a summary of our outstanding indebtedness. This description is only a summary of the_
_applicable obligations. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to,_
_all of the provisions of the corresponding agreements, including the definitions of certain terms therein that are not otherwise defined_
_in this offering memorandum._

**_Senior Credit Agreement_**

As of March 31, 2024, our Senior Credit Agreement consisted of the Revolving Credit Facility, a $1.5 billion term loan D
(the “2021 Term Loan”) and the 2019 Term Loan. Excluding accrued interest, the amount outstanding under our Senior Credit
Agreement as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was comprised solely of a 2019 Term Loan balance of $1.2 billion and a
2021 Term Loan balance of $1.5 billion. The maximum borrowing capacity available under the Revolving Credit Facility was
$619 million at March 31, 2024, net of $6 million of undrawn letters of credit. Our maximum borrowing capacity available under the
Revolving Credit Facility is limited by our required compliance with certain restrictive covenants, including, under certain
circumstances, our total first lien net leverage ratio covenant.

Borrowings under the 2021 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan currently bear interest at the one-month Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”) rate, plus an applicable margin of 3.0% and 2.5%, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the interest rate on
the balance outstanding under the 2021 Term Loan and the 2019 Term Loan were 8.4% and 7.9%, respectively. The 2021 Term Loan
and the 2019 Term Loan mature on December 1, 2028 and January 2, 2026, respectively.

We have entered into interest rate caps pursuant to an ISDA Master Agreement with two counterparties. The interest rate
caps protect us against adverse fluctuations in interest rates by reducing our exposure to variability in cash flows on a portion of our
variable-rate debt. At March 31, 2024, our interest rate caps had a combined notional value of approximately $2.6 billion through the
last business day in 2024 and then a reduction in notional value to approximately $2.1 billion until maturity on December 31, 2025.

The interest rate caps effectively limit the annual interest charged on our 2019 Term Loan and 2021 Term Loan to a
maximum of one-month Term SOFR of 4.96% and 5.047%. We are required to pay aggregate fees in connection with the interest rate
caps of approximately $34 million that is due and payable at maturity on December 31, 2025. In 2023, we received $4 million of cash
payments from the counterparties that we reclassify to reduce interest expense from the interest rate caps in our consolidated statement
of operations.

In connection with this offering, we expect to enter into the Third Amendment, pursuant to which, among other things, we
will (i) incur the 2024 Term Loan with a maturity date in 2029, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit
Facility by $55 million, resulting in aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility of $680 million and (iii) terminate
commitments under a $72.5 million tranche of the Revolving Credit Facility that matures on December 1, 2026. See “Summary —
Recent Developments — Credit Agreement Amendment.”

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the SOFR rate or the Base Rate, in each
case, plus an applicable margin based on the first lien leverage ratio test as set forth in the Senior Credit Agreement (the “First Lien
**_Leverage Ratio”). We are required to pay a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility,_**
which may range from 0.30% to 0.50% on an annual basis, based on the First Lien Leverage Ratio. “Base Rate” is defined as the
greatest of (i) the administrative agent’s prime rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) Adjusted Term SOFR (as
defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) for a one month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.0%.

The collateral for our obligations under our Senior Credit Agreement consists of substantially all of our and our subsidiaries’
personal property. In addition, our subsidiaries (other than subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted subsidiaries) are joint
and several guarantors of the obligations and our ownership interests in our subsidiaries are pledged to collateralize the obligations.
Our Senior Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, but not limited to, (i) limitations on additional
indebtedness, (ii) limitations on liens, (iii) limitations on the sale of assets, (iv) limitations on guarantees, (v) limitations on
investments and acquisitions, (vi) limitations on the payment of dividends and share repurchases, (vii) limitations on mergers and
(viii) maintenance of the First Lien Leverage Ratio while any amount is outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, as well as
other customary covenants for credit facilities of this type. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with
all covenants as required by our Senior Credit Agreement.

We are a holding company with no independent assets or operations. The aggregate assets, liabilities, earnings and equity of
the subsidiary guarantors as defined in our Senior Credit Agreement are substantially equivalent to our assets, liabilities, earnings and
equity on a consolidated basis. The subsidiary guarantors are, directly or indirectly, our wholly owned subsidiaries and the guarantees
of the subsidiary guarantors are full, unconditional and joint and several. All of our current direct and indirect subsidiaries, other than

33


-----

subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted subsidiaries, are guarantors under our Senior Credit Agreement and all of our
future direct and indirect subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions will be guarantors under our Senior Credit Agreement.

For further information concerning our Senior Credit Agreement, see Note 4 “Long-term Debt” to each of our unaudited and
audited consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum.

**_5.875% Senior Notes due 2026_**

As of March 31, 2024, we had $700.0 million of our 2026 Notes outstanding. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
the coupon interest rate and the yield on the 2026 Notes were 5.875%. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a
deferred loan cost balance, net of accumulated amortization, of $2 million and $3 million, respectively, related to our 2026 Notes.

We may redeem some or all of the 2026 Notes at specified redemption prices. If we sell certain of our assets or experience
specific kinds of changes of control, we must offer to repurchase the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes mature on July 15, 2026. Interest on
the 2026 Notes is payable semiannually, on May 15 and November 15 of each year.

The 2026 Notes have been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by all of our subsidiaries, other
than subsidiaries which we have designated as unrestricted subsidiaries. As of March 31, 2024, there were no significant restrictions
on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us or to other guarantor subsidiaries. The indenture governing the 2026 Notes
includes covenants with which we must comply which are typical for borrowing transactions of their nature. As of March 31, 2024

**_Receivables Purchase Agreement_**

On February 23, 2023, we, certain of our subsidiaries and a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary (the “Receivables SPV”),
entered into a three-year $300 million revolving accounts receivable securitization facility (the “Receivables Purchase Agreement”)
with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain third-party financial institutions (the “Purchasers”). The
Receivables Purchase Agreement permits the SPV to draw up to a total of $300 million (the “Securitization Facility”), subject to the
outstanding amount of the receivables pool and other factors. The Securitization Facility matures on February 23, 2026, and is subject
to customary termination events related to transactions of this type. The sale of receivables from the SPV is accounted for in the
Company’s financial statements as a “true-sale” under Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 860.

Under the Securitization Facility, the SPV sells to the Purchasers certain receivables, including all rights, title, and interest in the
related receivables (“Sold Receivables”). The SPV has guaranteed to each Purchaser the prompt payment of Sold Receivables, and to
secure the prompt payment and performance of such guaranteed obligations, the SPV has granted a security interest to the Purchasers
in all assets of the SPV and all Sold Receivables. In our capacity as servicer under the Securitization Facility, we are responsible for
administering and collecting receivables and have made customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities. We
do not record a servicing asset or liability since the estimated fair value of the servicing of the receivables approximates the servicing
income. We also provided a performance guarantee for the benefit of the Purchasers.

The Securitization Facility is subject to interest charges, at the adjusted one-month SOFR plus a margin (100 basis points) on the
amount of the outstanding facility. Servicing fee income recognized during 2023 was not material. The SPV is a separate legal entity
with its own separate creditors who will be entitled to access the SPV’s assets before the assets become available to us. As a result, the
SPV’s assets are not available to pay our creditors or any of our subsidiaries, although collections from the receivables in excess of
amounts required to repay the Purchasers under the Securitization Facility and other creditors of the SPV may be remitted to us.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

**General**

We will issue the Notes under an Indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date, among us, the Subsidiary
Guarantors and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Collateral
**_Agent”)._**

We summarize below certain material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents (as defined
below) and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). We do not restate those provisions in their entirety. We urge
you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement because they define
your rights. You can obtain copies of the foregoing from us or the Initial Purchasers.

The Company does not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. The Company will not be required to, nor does the
Company intend to, offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or otherwise register the Notes for resale
under the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, or subject to the
terms thereof. Accordingly, the terms of the Notes include only those stated in the Indenture.

Key terms used in this section are defined under “— Certain Definitions.” When we refer in this section to:

   - the “Company,” we mean Gray Television, Inc. and not its subsidiaries; and

   - the “Notes,” we mean Notes originally issued on the Issue Date and Additional Notes we may issue from time to time under
the Indenture.

**Overview of the Notes; Ranking**

The Notes will be senior secured first lien (subject to Permitted Liens) obligations of the Company and will rank:

    - equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Company, including the Senior Credit
Agreement, the 2031 Notes, the 2030 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes;

    - senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of the Company;

    - secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Collateral ranking equally and ratably with security interests in
Collateral securing all of the obligations of the Company under the Senior Credit Agreement and any other First Lien
Obligations, subject to certain liens permitted under the Indenture;

    - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is secured by Liens on assets of the
Company that do not constitute part of the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent of the value of such assets
(including the collateral sold to the Receivables SPV pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement);

    - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and liabilities of Subsidiaries of the Company that do
not guarantee the Notes; and

    - effectively senior to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Company that is either unsecured or secured by a Lien
that is junior to the Lien securing the Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral, including the 2031 Notes, the
2030 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes.

As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to this offering and the intended use of proceeds thereof (and after giving effect to a
$50 million voluntary prepayment of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement subsequent to quarter end, on April 1, 2024),
our total indebtedness (excluding intercompany indebtedness and before deducting financing costs) would have been approximately
$6.2 billion. The Company would have had approximately (x) $3.3 billion of Secured Indebtedness, consisting of $1.0 billion of the
Notes and $2.3 billion of indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement (and would also have had an additional $580.0 million of
undrawn availability under the revolving credit facility (excluding approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit)), ranking
_pari passu in right of security to the Notes and (y) $2.9 billion of unsecured indebtedness, consisting of $1.3 billion of the 2031 Notes,_
$800.0 million of the 2030 Notes and $750.0 million of the 2027 Notes, and the Subsidiary Guarantors would have had approximately
(x) $3.3 billion of Secured Indebtedness, consisting of guarantees of Indebtedness of $1.0 billion of the Notes and $2.3 billion under

36


-----

our Senior Credit Agreement, ranking pari passu in right of security to the Subsidiary Guarantees of the Notes, and (y) $2.9 billion of
unsecured indebtedness, consisting of guarantees of the 2031 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2027 Notes.

**Additional Notes**

Subject to the limitations set forth under “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” and “—
Certain Covenants — Limitation on Liens,” the Company may issue additional notes (“Additional Notes”) in one or more transactions,
which have substantially identical terms as Notes issued on the Issue Date, except that such Additional Notes may have different
CUSIP numbers, issuance dates and dates from which interest initially accrues. Holders of Additional Notes would have the right to
vote together with Holders of Notes issued on the Issue Date as one class. Any Additional Notes issued after this offering will be
secured by the Collateral, equally and ratably with the Notes. As a result, the issuance of Additional Notes may have the effect of
diluting the value of the security interest in the Collateral for the then outstanding Notes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

We will issue $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of Notes on the Issue Date in denominations of $2,000 and integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will mature on     , 2029.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate per annum set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum and will be
payable semi-annually in arrears on       and       commencing on       , 2024 to Holders of record on the immediately
preceding       and       . Interest on the Notes will accrue from the most recent date on which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of the original issuance of the Notes (the “Issue Date”). Interest will be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

Principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained
for such purpose within the City of New York or, at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the Holders of the Notes at their respective addresses as set forth in the register of Holders of Notes; provided that all payments of
principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or
held by The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) or its nominee will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to DTC
for further credit by DTC to the accounts of the holders thereof. We are not responsible for any delay by DTC in further crediting any
funds paid by or on behalf of us to the accounts of holders thereof. Until otherwise designated by the Company, the Company’s office
or agency in the City of New York will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such purpose. The Notes will be issued in fully
registered form, without coupons and in denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

We are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our business through our Subsidiaries. Our obligations under the
Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally, on a senior secured first lien basis (the “Subsidiary
**_Guarantees”) by the Subsidiary Guarantors._**

The obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount as will
result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. This provision may not be effective to protect the Subsidiary Guarantees
from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may eliminate a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to
an amount that effectively limits the value of a Subsidiary Guarantee or effectively makes such Subsidiary Guarantee worthless. The
obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be unconditional and absolute, irrespective of any
invalidity, illegality, unenforceability of any Note or the Indenture or any extension, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any
obligation of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor under any Note or the Indenture, or any modification or amendment of
or supplement to the Indenture.

As of the Issue Date, it is expected that all of the Company’s Subsidiaries other than subsidiaries which we have designated
as Unrestricted Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” and it is expected that all of our Restricted Subsidiaries will be
Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date. However, under the circumstances described below under the subheading “— Certain
Covenants — Limitation on Creation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” any of our other Subsidiaries may also be designated as
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not
guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of Unrestricted Subsidiaries and other non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors,
and claims of preferred stockholders (other than the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors) of those subsidiaries will have priority
with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Subsidiary

37


-----

Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes. The total assets held by the Company’s Unrestricted Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2024
was approximately $883 million.

The Indenture will provide that the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally
released:

(a) in the event of a sale or other transfer (including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock in
such Subsidiary Guarantor or issuance of Capital Stock by such Subsidiary Guarantor, in each case, following which such
Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Company, or upon the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor (including by way of consolidation or merger) to a Person other than us or a
Subsidiary Guarantor or upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

(b) upon the designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the
provisions described under the subheading “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Creation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries” or
upon such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a guarantor or obligor under the Senior Credit Agreement (other than a release
as a result of the repayment in full of the Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement); or

(c) in connection with a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Indenture or upon satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture.

The Subsidiary Guarantees will be senior secured first lien (subject to Permitted Liens) obligations of each
Subsidiary Guarantor and will:

        - rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of each such Subsidiary
Guarantor including such Subsidiary Guarantor’s guarantee of the Senior Credit Agreement, the 2031 Notes, the
2030 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes;

        - rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated Indebtedness of each such Subsidiary
Guarantor;

        - be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Collateral ranking equally and ratably with the
security interests in Collateral securing all of the obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Senior
Credit Agreement and any other First Lien Obligations, subject to certain liens permitted under the Indenture;

        - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors that is secured
by Liens on assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors that do not constitute part of the Collateral securing the Notes to
the extent of the value of such assets (including the collateral sold to the Receivables SPV pursuant to the
Receivables Sale Agreement);

        - structurally subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and liabilities of any non-Subsidiary Guarantor
Subsidiaries (including our Unrestricted Subsidiaries); and

        - effectively senior to all existing and future Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors that is either unsecured or
secured by a Lien that is junior to the Lien securing the Notes, to the extent of the value of the Collateral,
including the 2031 Notes, the 2030 Notes, the 2027 Notes and the 2026 Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary, unless such Subsidiary Guarantor is
also released from its obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be released from its
obligations under the Notes unless (i) the transaction or transactions that caused such Subsidiary Guarantor to cease to be a Subsidiary
are entered into for a bona fide business purpose (as determined in good faith by the Company) and, for the avoidance of doubt, not
for the primary purpose of causing such release, (ii) the portion of Equity Interests that caused such Subsidiary Guarantor to cease to
be a Subsidiary were not transferred to an Affiliate of the Company (other than for purposes of a bona fide joint venture arrangement
on terms that are not less favorable than arm’s-length terms, as determined in good faith by the Company) and (iii) after giving pro
forma effect to the applicable release, in the event the Company continues to retain an ownership interest in such Subsidiary
Guarantor, the Company is deemed to have made a new Investment in such Person on the date of such release (as if such Person were
not a Subsidiary Guarantor) in an amount equal to the portion of the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company)
of the Company’s retained ownership interest in such Person and such Investment is permitted hereunder.

38


-----

For all purposes under the Indenture, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any
comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset,
right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the
subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the
first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.

**Collateral and Security**

The Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured by Liens on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with any
and all Liens on the Collateral granted to secure Credit Agreement Obligations and any other First Lien Obligations. The Liens on the
Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be granted under the Notes Security Documents in favor of
U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, in its capacity as Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes. On the
Issue Date, we will enter into, and cause the Collateral Agent to enter into, the Collateral Agreement in respect of the assets that will
comprise Collateral (and take certain steps to perfect the security interests created thereby). The relative rights in the Collateral among
the Holders of the Notes, the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations and holders of any other First Lien Obligations will be
governed by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The other Persons holding First Lien Obligations may have rights and remedies
with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent
to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the Holders of the Notes.

The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors are able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could be secured by
Liens on the Collateral, including additional First Lien Obligations. The amount of such additional First Lien Obligations and
additional Indebtedness is limited by the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.” Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional First
Lien Obligations and additional Indebtedness could be significant.

The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, other than the
Excluded Assets, real property assets (unless subject after the Issue Date to a mortgage securing the Senior Credit Agreement) and
other than any assets released from the Collateral as described below under the caption “— Release of Liens on Collateral”.

**_First Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

The Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Credit Agreement Agent, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the
consent of the Holders of the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and
the Senior Credit Agreement. All references to the First Lien Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to
such First Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” will have the right to act or
refrain from acting or, if applicable, instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared
Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent and will remain the Credit
Agreement Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of the Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date”).
After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be (1) at any time when
the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations
that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (other than
the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral and (2) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is not
the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest
outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (including the Credit Agreement
Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). The “Controlling
Collateral Agent” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, until the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with
respect to such Shared Collateral, the Credit Agreement Agent and from and after the Applicable Authorized Representative Change
Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the collateral agent for the then Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of
the then Applicable Authorized Representative). Accordingly, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have rights to take any
action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the
Applicable Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent.

Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with
respect to any other intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). At any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is
the Controlling Collateral Agent, no other First Lien Secured Party shall or shall instruct any Authorized Representative to, and no

39


-----

Authorized Representative that is not the Controlling Collateral Agent shall, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to
take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in
or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any
intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only
the Credit Agreement Agent (or a Person authorized by it), acting in accordance with the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents,
shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral at such time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding that has been commenced by or against the
Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First
Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First
Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured
Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien
Secured Parties; provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the Liens granted in favor of
the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Parties to exercise
remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) any
Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be
obligated to) file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading
made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party,
including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative, the date that is 150 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 150-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default (as
defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable series of First Lien Obligations) and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and
each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that
(i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of
default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and (ii)
the First Lien Obligations of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in
accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized
Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared
Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with
respect to all or a material portion of the Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted
a security interest in any Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding. If the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any
rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and
thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise
of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay
in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to
have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any
such rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared
Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative
if it is not the Credit Agreement Agent) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien
on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in respect of any Shared
Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the
Applicable Authorized Representative or a Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to such Shared Collateral or
cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any
right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any case or proceeding (including any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, allowability, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of
any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

If an event of default under any document governing a series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and
the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral,
or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the Company or
any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment

-----

pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the
proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or received by
the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such
payment or distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the sentence immediately following)
shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after
payment of all amounts owing to the collateral agents of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as collateral agent) and
any administrative agent or trustee of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as such); provided that following the
commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, solely for
the purpose of this paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing such First Lien
Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First
Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien
Obligations of each series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First
Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding.

It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such series
(and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction
that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other
obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series do not have an
enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to
the security interest of such series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of First Lien
Obligations and (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such
series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, an
“Impairment” of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such
Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series
of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of First Lien
Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified
to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such First Lien
Obligations subject to such Impairment.

Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without
limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law),
any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the security documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such
obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or
other case or proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages
from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, if
such First Lien Secured Party is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, such First Lien Secured Party may not seek (and will waive any
right to) to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared
Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect
thereof pursuant to any document governing its First Lien Obligations or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable
law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor
agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral,
proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or
payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise
exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) each of the Liens in favor of any other First Lien Secured Party (including each other
collateral agent) for the benefit of each series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released
and discharged if, as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are
released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be allocated and applied as described
in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to a case
under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP

41


-----

**_Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of_**
cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable
Bankruptcy Law), each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or the Authorized Representative of any
Controlling Secured Party) will agree not to object to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same
(“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (in
the case of any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) other than the Credit Agreement Agent, acting on
the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative) opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens
and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral
for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such
Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured
Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu
with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each NonControlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor
Agreement), in each case so long as:

(A) the First Lien Secured Parties of each series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to
the DIP Lenders, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all
the other First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as
existed prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case;

(B) the First Lien Secured Parties of each series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to
any First Lien Secured Parties as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral
(in each case, except to the extent a Lien on additional or replacement collateral is granted to one series in consideration of collateral
of such series that is not Shared Collateral for a series that does not receive a Lien on such additional collateral), with the same priority
vis-a-vis the First Lien Secured Parties (other than any Liens of the First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) as set
forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement;

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First Lien Obligations,
such amount is applied pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (in each case, except to the extent a payment is made to one
series in consideration of Collateral of such series that is not Shared Collateral for a series that does not receive such payment); and

(D) if any First Lien Secured Parties are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in
connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the
First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (in each case, except to the extent such adequate protection is granted to one series in consideration
of Collateral of such series that is not Shared Collateral for a series that does not receive such adequate protection);

_provided that the First Lien Secured Parties of each series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP_
Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Secured Parties of such series or its Authorized Representative
that do not constitute Shared Collateral; and provided, further, that the First Lien Secured Parties receiving adequate protection shall
not object to any other First Lien Secured Party receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such
First Lien Secured Parties in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

The First Lien Secured Parties will acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any series may, subject to the limitations
set forth in the then extant documents governing such First Lien Obligations, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated,
supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the
priority of claims and application of proceeds set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof
defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any series.

In addition, without the prior written consent of the Credit Agreement Agent, the Notes Secured Parties will agree that no
Notes Security Document may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or entered into to the extent such
amendment, restatement, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new Notes Security Document would contravene any of the
terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement_**

In the event that any future Indebtedness is incurred that is secured by a Lien on a junior priority basis relative to the Lien
securing the First Lien Obligations, a junior lien intercreditor agreement will be entered into (the “Junior Lien Intercreditor
**_Agreement”). The Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement will subordinate the Liens securing such future Indebtedness to the Liens_**
securing the First Lien Obligations with respect to all Collateral on the terms set forth in such intercreditor agreement. The form of the

42


-----

Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be determined by the Credit Agreement Agent (or if the Senior Credit Agreement has been
terminated, the Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be in a form that the Company has determined in good faith is reasonably
customary which shall provide for the subordination of the Liens securing Obligations on a junior priority basis relative to the Liens
securing the First Lien Obligations and other intercreditor provisions with respect thereto as are reasonably customary in the good
faith determination of the Company for intercreditor agreements governing the relationship between senior and junior priority Liens,
in each case, as certified by the Company to the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, if applicable, in an Officer’s Certificate).

**_Release of Liens on Collateral_**

The Indenture and the Collateral Agreement will provide that the security interests in the Collateral in respect of the Notes
(and the Subsidiary Guarantees in the case of clauses (1) through (4) below) will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in whole, upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as set forth under the caption “— Satisfaction and
_Discharge”;_

(2) in whole, upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Notes as set forth under the caption “—
_Defeasance”;_

(3) in whole, upon payment in full and discharge of all Notes outstanding under the Indenture and all Obligations with
respect to the Notes that are outstanding, due and payable under the Indenture at the time the Notes are paid in full
and discharged;

(4) in whole or in part, with the consent of the Holders of the requisite percentage of Notes in accordance with the
provisions described below under the caption “Modification and Amendments”;

(5) with respect to any Collateral if such Collateral is sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of by the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor to any Person (other than the Company or a Subsidiary Guarantor) that is not and is not
required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by the Senior Credit Agreement, the Indenture and
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, including any accounts receivable and related assets sold to the Receivables
SPV pursuant to the Receivables Sale Agreement;

(6) in whole or in part, if the Credit Agreement Agent releases or will release its lien on such Collateral, concurrently
therewith, unless such release occurs in connection with a discharge in full in cash of the Senior Credit Agreement,
which discharge is not in connection with a foreclosure of, or other exercise of remedies with respect to, Collateral
by the Credit Agreement Secured Parties;

(7) with respect to the Liens on the assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor, upon designation of such Subsidiary Guarantor as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, or upon such Subsidiary Guarantor otherwise
being released from its Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(8) with respect to any Collateral, if such Collateral constitutes or becomes an Excluded Asset; and

(9) with respect to Liens on any asset to the extent not constituting Collateral.

**_Creation and Perfection of Certain Security Interests After the Issue Date_**

The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to create and
perfect on the Issue Date the security interests in the Collateral for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, but to the extent any such
security interest could not be created or perfected by such date (other than the filing of financing statements that will be in any event
filed on the Issue Date), the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to do or cause to be done all acts and things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and
enforceable and perfected, to the extent required by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents and subject to the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement, and in no event later than 120 days after the Issue Date. Subject to the provisions set forth below, failure to
obtain such consents and create and perfect a security interest in such Collateral within such period constitutes an Event of Default if
and to the extent provided under clause (ix) under the caption “Events of Default” below. The Company and each Subsidiary
Guarantor will deliver security documents granting a lien in favor of the Collateral Agent on the Equity Interests of first tier Foreign
Subsidiaries to the extent the same has been delivered to the Credit Agreement Agent pursuant to the terms of the Senior Credit
Agreement on substantially the same terms and with the same priority (subject to applicable local law) (i) with respect to any such
security documents entered into prior to the Issue Date, on the Issue Date or within 120 days thereafter and (ii) with respect to any

43


-----

such security documents entered into after the Issue Date, on the date the same has been delivered to the Credit Agreement Agent. The
Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will only be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver control agreements
with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts to the extent that the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor delivered or
provided the same in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if after using commercially
reasonable efforts such a security interest in an asset could not be created or perfected because a third-party consent had not been, or
cannot be, obtained or local law did not permit a security interest to be granted to more than one secured party, the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor will not be required to create or perfect such security interest. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will
not be required to perfect any Liens in favor of the Collateral Agent by control in letter-of-credit rights or electronic chattel paper or
obtain any landlord access agreements or bailee waivers even if they are provided in connection with the Senior Credit Agreement.
For avoidance of doubt, references in this paragraph to Collateral do not include Excluded Assets. Neither the Trustee nor the
Collateral Agent on behalf of the Holders of the Notes has any duty or responsibility to see to or monitor the performance of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with regard to these matters or to make filings or recordings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any
security interests. Delivery of security interests in other Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the security interests
could be avoidable in bankruptcy.

**_Further Assurances_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will do or cause to be done all acts and things
that may be required under applicable law or that the Collateral Agent from time to time may reasonably request, to assure and
confirm that the Collateral Agent holds, for the benefit of the Holders of Notes, duly created and enforceable and perfected Liens upon
the Collateral (including any property or assets that are acquired or otherwise become, or are required by any Notes Security
Document to become, Collateral after the Notes are issued), in each case, as contemplated by, and with the Lien priority required
under, the Notes Security Documents, and subject to the limitations set forth in the Notes Security Documents. Subject to the
requirements and limitations of the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents and subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,
as necessary or upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Agent at any time and from time to time, the Company and the
Subsidiary Guarantors will, at the Company’s and the Subsidiary Guarantor’s expense, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver
such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents, and take such other actions as will be reasonably
required under applicable law or that the Collateral Agent may reasonably request, in each case, to create, perfect or protect the Liens
and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as contemplated by the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents for the benefit
of the Holders of Notes, in each case, and subject to the limitations set forth in the Notes Security Documents and the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Maintenance of Collateral_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company will maintain and preserve, and cause each of its Restricted Subsidiaries to (i)
maintain and preserve, all of its properties constituting Collateral that are useful and necessary in the normal conduct of its business in
good working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and (ii) keep its insurable property insured at all times by
financially sound and reputable insurers, except, in the case of clauses (i) and (ii), where failure to do so could not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect.

The Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor shall not (a) change its name as it appears in official filings in the state of its
incorporation or organization, (b) change its chief executive office, principal place of business or mailing address, (c) change the type
of entity that it is or (d) change its state of incorporation or organization, in each case, unless such change is not prohibited by the
Indenture and the Notes Security Documents and will not adversely impact the Collateral Agent’s lien on the Collateral. After any
such change has occurred, the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, shall take any action necessary to continue the
perfection and priority of any liens in favor of the Collateral Agent, for the benefit of Holders of the Notes, in any Collateral as
required by the terms of the Collateral Agreement and subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and provide a notice thereof to
the Collateral Agent.

**_Insurance_**

The Indenture will provide that the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will maintain insurance with reputable insurance
companies on all their respective property in at least such amounts and against such risks (but including in any event public liability,
product liability and business interruption) as are customarily insured against in the same general area by companies engaged in a
Similar Business. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors shall deliver to the Collateral Agent concurrently with the delivery to
the Credit Agreement Agent (if the Credit Agreement Agent requests such endorsements) (x) to all “All Risk” physical damage
insurance policies on all of the Company’s or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s material tangible personal property and assets naming the
Collateral Agent as loss payee, and (y) to all general liability and other liability policies of the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor
naming the Collateral Agent an additional insured.

44


-----

**_After Acquired Assets_**

Upon the acquisition by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor after the Issue Date of any assets (other than Excluded
Assets), the Company or such Subsidiary Guarantor shall execute and deliver with regard to any after-acquired property that qualifies
as Collateral, as are required under (and within the time frames set forth in) the Indenture or the Notes Security Documents and
subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any information, documentation, financing statements or other certificates as may be
necessary to vest in the Collateral Agent for the Holders of the Notes a perfected security interest, with the priority required by the
Indenture and the Notes Security Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens and certain other exceptions set forth in the Indenture
and the Notes Security Documents relating to the Notes, in such after-acquired property and to have such after-acquired property
added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall
be deemed to relate to such after-acquired property to the same extent and with the same force and effect. If the Company or any
Subsidiary Guarantor creates or perfects any additional security interest upon any property or assets to secure any First Lien
Obligations, it must concurrently grant and perfect a security interest upon such property as security for the Notes.

**Redemption**

**_Optional Redemption. Except as described below, the Notes will not be redeemable at our option prior to    , 2026. On_**
and after such date, the Notes will be subject to redemption at our option, at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, at the
redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount of the Notes) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest to
the date fixed for redemption, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on        of the years indicated below.

**Period** **Percentage**

2026 ............................................................................................................................. %

2027 ............................................................................................................................. %

2028 and thereafter ..................................................................................................... 100.000%

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to      , 2026, we may, at our option, use the net proceeds of one or more
Equity Issuances at any time and from time to time, to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including
Additional Notes, if any) originally issued, at a redemption price equal to    % of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption; provided, however, that at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Notes originally issued on the Issue Date remains outstanding immediately after any such redemption.

At any time prior to        , 2026, we may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including
Additional Notes, if any) during any twelve-month period at a redemption price equal to 103.000% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption.

At any time prior to       , 2026, the Notes may be redeemed at any time and from time to time, at the option of the
Company, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Make Whole Premium as of, and accrued but
unpaid interest, if any, to, the redemption date, subject to the right of Holders on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date.

In addition, in connection with any Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer, if Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such offer and the Company, or any third
party making such offer in lieu of the Company, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the
Company or such third party will have the right upon notice given not more than 30 days following such purchase date, to redeem all
Notes that remain outstanding at a redemption price equal to the price offered to each other Holder in such offer plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but not including, the date of such redemption.

Notice of redemption will be provided, and subject to the terms, as set forth under “— Selection and Notice” below.

“Make Whole Premium” means with respect to a Note at any redemption date, the greater of (i) 1.0% of the principal
amount of such Note or (ii) the excess of (A) the present value of (1) the redemption price of such Note at      , 2026 (such

45


-----

redemption price being set forth in the table above) plus (2) all required interest payments due on such Note through      , 2026,
computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points, over (B) the principal amount of such Note.

“Treasury Rate” means the weekly average rounded to the nearest 1/100th of a percentage point (for the most recently
completed week for which such information is available as of the date that is two Business Days prior to the redemption date) of the
yield to maturity at the time of computation of United States Treasury securities with a constant maturity (as compiled and published
in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 with respect to each applicable day during such week or, if such Statistical Release is no
longer published, any publicly available source or similar market data) most nearly equal to the period from the redemption date to
, 2026; provided, however, that if the period from the redemption date to      , 2026 is not equal to the constant maturity of a
United States Treasury security for which such a yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated
to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are
given, except that if the period from the redemption date to      , 2026 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actively
traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

**_Selection and Notice. If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, selection of the Notes to be redeemed will_**
be made by the Trustee, on behalf of the Company, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange,
if any, on which the Notes are listed or, if the Notes are not listed on a securities exchange by the Trustee, on behalf of the Company,
on a pro rata basis, by lot or by any other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate or, in the event the Notes are in global
form, as prescribed by DTC. Notes redeemed in part shall only be redeemed in integral multiples of $1,000. Notices of any
redemption shall be mailed by first class mail or, if the Notes are in global form, delivered to DTC through customary procedures, at
least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at such Holder’s registered
address. If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof to be redeemed, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of the original Note a new Note
in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Note promptly after the original Note has been cancelled. On and
after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in payment therefor, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof
called for redemption.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to,
completion of a transaction (including, without limitation, an Equity Issuance, an incurrence of Indebtedness or a Change of Control
Repurchase Event) at the Company’s discretion. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the
redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or, for the avoidance of doubt,
waived), or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied (or, for the avoidance of debt, waived) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed
without requiring an additional advance notice. In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption
price and performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person.

**Change of Control**

In the event of a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined herein), the Company will make an offer to purchase all of
the then outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of purchase, in accordance with the terms prescribed below (a “Change of Control Offer”).

Within 30 days after any Change of Control Repurchase Event, we will deliver to each Holder of Notes at such Holder’s
registered address or, if the Notes are in global form, delivered to DTC through customary procedures, a notice stating: (i) that a
Change of Control Repurchase Event has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Company to purchase all or a
portion (equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Purchase
**_Date”), which shall be a Business Day, specified in such notice, that is not earlier than 10 days or later than 60 days from the date such_**
notice is delivered, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Repurchase
Event as provided under “— Selection and Notice” above in which event such date of purchase need not be made within such 60 day
period, (ii) the amount of accrued and unpaid interest as of the Change of Control Purchase Date, (iii) that any Note not tendered will
continue to accrue interest, (iv) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price for the Notes payable pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest
on and after the Change of Control Purchase Date, (v) the procedures, consistent with the Indenture, to be followed by a Holder of
Notes in order to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance, and (vi) such other information as may be
required by the Indenture and applicable laws and regulations.

46


-----

On the Change of Control Purchase Date, we will (i) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the paying agent the aggregate purchase price of all Notes or portions thereof accepted for
payment and any accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes as of the Change of Control Purchase Date, and (iii) deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation all Notes tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. The paying agent shall promptly
deliver to each Holder of Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment an amount equal to the purchase price for such Notes plus
any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and
deliver to such Holder of Notes accepted for payment in part a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Notes, and any Note not accepted for payment in whole or in part for any reason consistent with the Indenture shall be promptly
returned to the Holder of such Note. On and after a Change of Control Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or
portions thereof accepted for payment, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price therefor. We will announce
the results of the Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase
Date.

We will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and
all other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with any Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision will not require us to make a Change of Control Offer upon the
consummation of certain transactions involving Permitted Holders. See “— Certain Definitions — Change of Control” and “—
_Certain Definitions — Permitted Holders.” As a result of the definition of “Permitted Holders,” a concentration of control in the hands_
of Permitted Holders would not give rise to a situation where Holders would be entitled to have their Notes repurchased pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer. As of March 8, 2024, collectively, the Howell-Robinson family beneficially owned approximately 46.1% of
the Company’s outstanding Voting Stock.

We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if (1) a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the
Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption
“— Redemption” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. A Change of Control Offer may be
made in advance of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, contingent upon such Change of Control Repurchase Event, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision and the other covenants that limit the ability of the Company to incur
debt may not necessarily afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, such as a reorganization, merger or
similar transaction involving the Company that may adversely affect Holders, because such transactions may not involve a
concentration in voting power or beneficial ownership, or, if there were such a concentration, may not involve a concentration of the
magnitude required under the definition of “Change of Control” and may not result in the occurrence of a Ratings Event. The
Company may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. In addition, even if it
has sufficient funds, the Company may be prohibited from repurchasing the Notes under the terms of other agreements relating to the
Company’s Indebtedness at the time, including any Senior Credit Facilities. The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions
described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other transactions involving the Company or its subsidiaries by
increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions.

With respect to the sale of “substantially all” the assets of the Company, which would constitute a Change of Control for
purposes of the Indenture, the meaning of the phrase “substantially all” varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject
transaction, has no clearly established meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of
“substantially all” of the assets of the Company and, therefore, it may be unclear whether a Change of Control has occurred and
whether the Notes would be subject to a Change of Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status._**

Following the first day:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and

47


-----

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture, then, beginning on that
day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will not be
subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following headings (collectively, the “Suspended
**_Covenants”):_**

      - “— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness,”

      - “— Limitation on Restricted Payments,”

      - “— Limitation on Asset Sales,”

      - “— Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries,”

      - “— Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates,”

      - “— Future Subsidiary Guarantors,” and

      - the provisions of clause (iv) of the first paragraph of “— Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets.”

If at any time the Notes thereafter cease to have Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants will thereafter be
reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and be applicable pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture (including in connection with performing any calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the
Indenture), unless and until the Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no
longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); provided, however, that no Default, Event of
Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees with respect to the Suspended
Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events
occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation
arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable
Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and
the Reversion Date, if any, is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, if any, all Indebtedness incurred during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have been
outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (xi) of the second paragraph of “— Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness” and the amount of Excess Proceeds from Asset Sales shall be reset at zero. Calculations made after the_
Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “— Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be
made as though the covenants described thereunder had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension
Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount
available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of or any other provision under “— Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” or reduce amounts available to be made as Permitted Investments. In addition, any obligation to grant additional_
Guarantees of the Notes shall be suspended during the Suspension Period. All such further obligations to grant additional Guarantees
of the Notes shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any knowledge of the ratings
of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve Investment Grade Status or cease to have such Investment
Grade Status.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of_**
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, create, incur, assume or directly or indirectly guarantee or in any other manner become directly or
indirectly liable for (“incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) if, immediately after giving pro forma effect to such
incurrence and the application of the proceeds thereof, the Debt to Operating Cash Flow Ratio of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is more than 7.00 to 1.0; provided that Non-Guarantors may not incur Indebtedness under this paragraph if, after giving
**_pro forma effect to such incurrence (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), more than an aggregate of the_**
greater of $220.0 million and 2.0% of Consolidated Total Assets of Indebtedness of such Non-Guarantors would be outstanding
pursuant to this paragraph at such time.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to the incurrence of any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Indebtedness”):

48


-----

(i) Indebtedness of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors incurred under Senior Credit
Facilities, and Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding

outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement on the Issue Date (assuming, in the case of any revolving credit
facility thereunder, that such facility is fully drawn) and (y) an amount equal to Operating Cash Flow of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries for the most recent Test Period, determined on a pro forma basis with the
_pro forma adjustments set forth in clause (ii) of the definition of “Debt to Operating Cash Flow Ratio” and as_
determined in good faith by the Company, times 3.50 plus (c) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness incurred

Indebtedness is owed to or held by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, such Indebtedness
must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect to the Notes, in
the case of the Company, or the Guarantee of such Subsidiary Guarantor, in the case of a Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock that results in any such Indebtedness being
held by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof and (ii) any the transfer or other
disposition of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof,
shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause (iv);

(v) Indebtedness of the Company consisting of guarantees of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary and
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of guarantees of any Indebtedness of the Company or another Restricted

days after the date on which the related definitive acquisition agreement or LMA, as the case may be, was entered into by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, (x) the aggregate principal amount of such Acquisition Debt is no greater than the aggregate
principal amount of Acquisition Debt set forth in a notice from the Company to the Trustee (an “Incurrence Notice”) within 30 days
after the date on which the related definitive acquisition agreement or LMA, as the case may be, was entered into by the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, which notice shall be executed on the Company’s behalf by the chief financial officer of the Company in
such capacity and shall describe in reasonable detail the acquisition or LMA, as the case may be, which such Acquisition Debt will be
incurred to finance, (y) after giving pro forma effect to the acquisition or LMA, as the case may be, described in such Incurrence
Notice, the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary could have incurred such Acquisition Debt under the Indenture as of the date upon
which the Company delivers such Incurrence Notice to the Trustee and (z) such Acquisition Debt is utilized solely to finance the
acquisition or LMA, as the case may be, described in such Incurrence Notice (including to repay or refinance Indebtedness or other

Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary and not incurred in contemplation thereof (provided that, in the case of this
clause (c), the only obligors with respect to such Indebtedness shall be those Persons who were obligors of such
Indebtedness prior to such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, on the date of consummation of such
acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination);

subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that (a) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall not
increase the amount available for making Restricted Payments to the extent the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur
Indebtedness in reliance thereon and (b) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes of
incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause to the extent such net cash proceeds or cash have been applied to make Restricted

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant:

(1) in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of
Indebtedness permitted pursuant to clauses (i) through (xxii) above, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, be permitted to
classify such item of Indebtedness in any manner that complies with this covenant and may from time to time reclassify such
items of Indebtedness in any manner that would comply with this covenant at the time of such reclassification; for the
avoidance of doubt, any incurrence of Indebtedness may, if applicable, be classified or reclassified in part as being incurred
under the first paragraph of this covenant and in part under one or more categories of Permitted Indebtedness;

(2) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions
of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(3) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in
this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, shall classify such Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount
of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses;

(4) accrual of interest (including interest paid-in-kind) and the accretion of accreted value will not be deemed
to be an incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant; and

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to
the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant:

(1) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company may
incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of
currencies; and

(2) Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Senior Credit Agreement prior to or on the Issue Date shall be treated
as initially incurred pursuant to clause (i)(b) of the definition of “Permitted Indebtedness”.

Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any Restricted Payment (including by operation of or as a result of an LLC
Division), unless at the time of and immediately after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment (with the value of any such

51


-----

Restricted Payment, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith and which
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a board resolution),

(ii) the Company could incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph under “—
_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness”,_

Preferred Stock) to the extent that such proceeds are not used to redeem, repurchase, retire or otherwise acquire Capital Stock
or any Indebtedness of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company pursuant to clause (ii) of the next paragraph or (y)
Indebtedness of the Company issued since June 30, 2020 (other than to Subsidiaries), that has been converted into Capital
Stock of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preferred Stock);

(d) to the extent that any Unrestricted Subsidiary is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary after June 30, 2020,
100% of the fair market value of such Subsidiary as of the date of such redesignation;

(e) the aggregate amount returned in cash or Cash Equivalents with respect of Investments (other than
Permitted Investments) made after June 30, 2020, whether through interest payments, principal payments, dividends, return
of capital or other distributions; and

(f) in the case of the disposition or repayment of any Investment for cash (in whole or in part), which
Investment constituted a Restricted Payment made after June 30, 2020, an amount equal to the return of capital (to the extent
of cash received) with respect to such Investment, reduced (but not below zero) by the excess, if any, of the cost of the
disposition of such Investment over the gain, if any, realized by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such
disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture will provide that, in addition to (and without limitation of) the limitations set
forth above, use of clause (iii) set forth above shall be limited to (a) $25,000,000 in any fiscal year if, at the time of and immediately
after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment, the First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 5.00 to 1.00, (b)

Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00, (c) $150,000,000 in any fiscal year if, at the time of and immediately after
giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment, the First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, and (d) the
Carryover Amount (which shall be deemed to be used first in the event of any utilization of clause (iii) set forth above at a time when
the First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but less than 4.00 to 1.00) plus $150,000,000 in any fiscal year if,
at the time of and immediately after giving effect to the proposed Restricted Payment, the First Lien Leverage Ratio is greater than or

The “Carryover Amount” shall be determined as of the last day of each fiscal year of the Company, and shall equal (x) if the
First Lien Leverage Ratio as of the last day of such fiscal year is greater than or equal to 4.00 to 1.00, $0 and (y) if the First Lien
Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any fiscal year is less than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of such fiscal year, the lesser of (A)
$75,000,000 and (B) that portion of the basket set forth in clause (d) of the immediately preceding paragraph permitted to have been
used during such fiscal year but not actually utilized during such fiscal year.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company would have had approximately $3.2 billion of capacity to make Restricted Payments
pursuant to clause (iii) above. As of the Issue Date, the Company’s ability to make Restricted Payments pursuant to clause (iii) above
is limited by the immediately preceding paragraph.

(xv) the repurchase of Equity Interests deemed to occur upon the exercise or conversion of stock options,
warrants or other convertible securities or that are surrendered in connection with satisfying any income tax withholding
obligation related to any such exercise or vesting of any equity award, and the payment of cash in lieu of the issuance of

Interests of the Company or arising out of stock dividends, splits or combinations or business combinations;

(xvi) payments or distributions to dissenting stockholders pursuant to applicable law in connection with a

consolidations and transfers of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Company;

(xvii) mandatory redemptions of Disqualified Stock issued as a Restricted Payment or as consideration for a
Permitted Investment; provided that the amount of such redemptions are no greater than the amount that constituted a
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment;

(xviii) distributions or payments of Securitization Fees, sales contributions and other transfers of Securitization
Assets and purchases of Securitization Assets pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation, in each case in connection
with a Qualified Securitization Financing;

(xix) Restricted Payments consisting of (i) dividends on the common or Preferred Stock of the Company or (ii)
repurchases of common or Preferred Stock of the Company, not to exceed an amount in any calendar year equal to the sum of
(a) $90.0 million and (b) the greater of (x) $90.0 million and (y) 5.0% of Market Capitalization (with the aggregate unused
amounts in any calendar year being available to be so utilized in the next succeeding calendar year (for purposes of clause
(y), in determining whether there are unused amounts available to be so utilized in the next succeeding calendar year, Market
Capitalization shall be calculated as if such a Restricted Payment would have been made at December 31 of the preceding
calendar year));

(xx) (A) Restricted Payments (for the avoidance of doubt, made pursuant to this clause (A)) not to exceed the
greater of (x) $220.0 million in the aggregate and (y) 2.0% of the Consolidated Total Assets calculated at the time of such
Restricted Payment and (B) provided that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result
therefrom), any Restricted Payments, so long as (for the avoidance of doubt, made pursuant to this clause (B)), after giving
_pro forma effect to the payment of any such Restricted Payment, the Debt to Operating Cash Flow Ratio shall be no greater_
than 3.75 to 1.00; and

(xxi) Restricted Payments consisting of redemptions of Preferred Stock of the Company, so long as (i) no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from such Restricted Payment and (ii) the Debt to
Operating Cash Flow Ratio (calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment and any Indebtedness
incurred in connection therewith) is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00.

In computing the amount of Restricted Payments for purposes of clause (iii) of the second preceding paragraph, Restricted
Payments made under clauses (i) and (vii) of the preceding paragraph shall be included and Restricted Payments made under the other
clauses of the preceding paragraph shall not be included.

For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted
Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payment permitted pursuant to clauses (i) through (xxi)
above, the Company shall, in its sole discretion, be permitted to classify such Restricted Payment in any manner that complies with
this covenant (including categorization as a Permitted Investment) and may from time to time reclassify such Restricted Payment in
any manner that would comply with this covenant at the time of such reclassification (including categorization as a Permitted
Investment); furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, any Restricted Payment may, if applicable, be classified or reclassified in part as
being incurred under clause (xx)(B) and/or (xxi), as applicable, of this covenant and in part under one or more other clauses of this
covenant or one or more categories of the definition of “Permitted Investment”.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted_**
Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Sale (including by operation of or as a result of an LLC Division) unless (i) the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market value
(determined by the Company in good faith as of the date the Company enters into a definitive agreement relating to such Asset Sale)
of the assets or other property sold or disposed of in the Asset Sale and (ii) except (x) in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap or (y) if
such Asset Sale has a purchase price of less than the greater of $220.0 million and 2.0% of Consolidated Total Assets, at least 75% of
such consideration is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or assets used or useful in the business of the Company; provided that
for purposes of this covenant “cash” shall include (A) the amount of any liabilities (other than liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated to the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary (as shown on the Company’s or
such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto) that are assumed by the transferee in connection with

55


-----

such assets or other property in such Asset Sale (and excluding any liabilities that are incurred in connection with or in anticipation of
such Asset Sale), but only to the extent that there is no further recourse to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such
liabilities and (B) any Designated Noncash Consideration having an aggregate fair market value that, when taken together with all
other Designated Noncash Consideration previously received and then outstanding, does not exceed the greater of $330.0 million and
3.0% of Consolidated Total Assets at the time of the receipt of such Designated Noncash Consideration (with the fair market value of
each item of Designated Noncash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes
in value).

Notwithstanding clause (ii) above, (a) all or a portion of the consideration in connection any such Asset Sale may consist of
all or substantially all of the assets or a majority of the Voting Stock of an existing television business, franchise or Station (whether
existing as a separate entity, subsidiary, division, unit or otherwise) or any related business used or useful in the Company’s business
and (b) the Company may, and may permit its Subsidiaries to, issue shares of Capital Stock in a Qualified Joint Venture to a Qualified
Joint Venture Partner without regard to clause (ii) above; provided that, in the case of any of clause (a) or (b) of this sentence after
giving effect to any such Asset Sale and related acquisition of assets or Voting Stock, (x) no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred or be continuing; and (y) the Net Proceeds of any such Asset Sale, if any, are applied in accordance with this covenant.

Within 365 days after any Asset Sale (or such shorter period as the Company in its sole election may determine), the
Company may elect to apply or cause to be applied an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from such Asset Sale to:

(a) repay either (i) Credit Agreement Obligations or (ii) other First Lien Obligations (and if the Indebtedness repaid is
revolving credit indebtedness, to correspondingly permanently reduce commitments with respect thereto); provided that in the case of
any repayment pursuant to this clause (ii), the Company shall make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase a pro rata (together with any First Lien Obligations repaid pursuant to this clause (ii))
principal amount of the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including
the date of repayment;

(b) make an investment in, or acquire assets related to or otherwise useful in the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
existing on the Issue Date; and/or

(c) to make capital expenditures in or that are used or useful in the business or to make capital expenditures for maintenance,
repair or improvement of existing assets in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale not applied or invested as provided in clauses (a) through (c) above within 365 days (or
such shorter period as the Company in its sole election may determine) of such Asset Sale will be deemed to constitute “Excess
**_Proceeds” on the 366th day after such Asset Sale (or for the avoidance of doubt on the day after such shorter application or investment_**
period as the Company in its sole election may determine); provided that in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to
satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment; provided, further, that if such commitment is later terminated or
cancelled prior to the application of such Net Proceeds or such Net Proceeds are not so applied within such 180-day period, then such
Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

In no event later than 20 Business Days after any date (an “Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date”) that the aggregate amount of
Excess Proceeds exceeds $75.0 million (or such lesser amount as the Company shall determine), the Company shall commence an
offer to purchase to all Holders of Notes (an “Asset Sale Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase and to all holders of other First Lien Obligations containing provisions similar to
those set forth in the Indenture with respect to asset sales, in each case, equal to the Excess Proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount
of Notes and other First Lien Obligations tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will
select the Notes and the Company or its agent shall select the other First Lien Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis, by lot or
such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate or, in the event the Notes are in global form, as prescribed by DTC. Upon
completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. To the extent that any Excess Proceeds
remain after completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes and such
amount shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds.

In connection with an Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall mail to each Holder of Notes at such Holder’s registered address
or, if the Notes are in global form, delivered to DTC through customary procedures, a notice stating: (i) that an Asset Sale Offer
Trigger Date has occurred and that the Company is offering to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds (and identifying other Indebtedness, if any, that is entitled to participate pro rata in the Asset
Sale Offer), at an offer price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of

56


-----

purchase (the “Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date”), which shall be a Business Day, specified in such notice, that is not earlier than 30
days or later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, (ii) the amount of accrued and unpaid interest as of the Asset Sale
Offer Purchase Date, (iii) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iv) that, unless the Company defaults in the
payment of the purchase price for the Notes payable pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the
Asset Sale Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, (v) the procedures, consistent with the
Indenture, to be followed by a Holder of Notes in order to accept an Asset Sale Offer or to withdraw such acceptance, and (vi) such
other information as may be required by the Indenture and applicable laws and regulations.

On the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, the Company will (i) accept for payment the maximum principal amount of Notes or
portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer that can be purchased out of Excess Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (ii)
deposit with the paying agent the aggregate purchase price of all Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment and any accrued and
unpaid interest on such Notes as of the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee all
Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. If less than all Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer are accepted for
payment by the Company for any reason consistent with the Indenture, selection of the Notes to be purchased by the Company shall
be in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed or, if the
Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures of DTC if the Notes are represented by global notes); provided that Notes accepted for payment in
part shall only be purchased in integral multiples of $1,000. The paying agent shall promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes or
portions thereof accepted for payment an amount equal to the purchase price for such Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver to such Holder of Notes accepted for payment in part a new Note
equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes, and any Note not accepted for payment in whole or in part shall be
promptly returned to the Holder of such Note. On and after an Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on the
Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price therefor. The
Company will announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer to Holders of the Notes on or as soon as practicable after the Asset Sale
Offer Purchase Date.

The Company will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, and all other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with any Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Company
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the
Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Senior Credit Agreement limits, and any future credit facilities may limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes, and
also provides that certain asset sale events with respect to the Company would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement.
Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and
provisions. In the event an Asset Sale generating Excess Proceeds occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing
Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain
prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of
Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under such other agreements.

**_Limitation on Liens. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,_**
directly or indirectly, enter into, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens of any kind, other than Permitted Liens, on or with
respect to any of its property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom
without, in the case of any Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, securing the Notes and all other amounts due under the
Indenture (for so long as such Lien exists) equally and ratably with (or prior to) the obligations or liability secured by such Lien.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries. The Indenture_**
will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of its Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company to (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company on its Capital Stock or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or
pay any Indebtedness owed to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) make loans or advances to the
Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, or (iii) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any
other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing on the Issue Date or otherwise
existing under or by reason of (a) the Senior Credit Agreement and any amendments, restatements, renewals, replacements or
refinancings thereof, (b) applicable law, (c) any instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock (i) in effect on the Issue Date or
(ii) of an Acquired Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such acquisition
(except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with such acquisition); provided that such restriction is not

57


-----

applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Acquired Person, (d) customary non-assignment
provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business, (e) purchase money Indebtedness or Capital Lease Obligations that
only impose restrictions on the property so acquired (and proceeds generated therefrom), (f) an agreement for the sale or disposition of
the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such restriction is only applicable to such Restricted
Subsidiary or assets, as applicable, and such sale or disposition otherwise is permitted under the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Asset Sales”; and provided, further that such restriction or encumbrance shall be effective only for a period from the_
execution and delivery of such agreement through a termination date not later than 365 days after such execution and delivery, (g)
customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements, organizational documents and other
similar agreements and instruments, (h) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under an agreement entered into the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practices, (i) any encumbrance or restriction
pursuant to Hedging Obligations, (j) other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries permitted to be
incurred or issued subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “— Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness”) that impose restrictions solely on the Foreign Subsidiaries party thereto or their Subsidiaries, (k) any_
encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (which, if it relates to any Indebtedness, shall only be
permitted if such Indebtedness is permitted to be incurred pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under “— Limitation
_on Incurrence of Indebtedness” if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole_
(i) are not materially less favorable to the Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Credit Agreement
existing on the Issue Date, together with the security documents associated therewith as in effect on the Issue Date) or (ii) either (a)
the Company determines at the time of entry into such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not
adversely affect, in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) such
encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default relating to such agreement or instrument, (l) any
encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “— Limitation on Liens,” (m) restrictions created in
connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company,
are necessary or advisable to effect such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility, (n) Refinancing Indebtedness permitted under
the Indenture; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing such Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially
more restrictive in the aggregate than those contained in the agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced immediately
prior to such refinancing, and (o) the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Indenture will provide that the Company will not, and will not permit any of_**
its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter into or suffer to exist any transaction or series of related transactions
(including, without limitation, the sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets, property or services) with any Affiliate of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary unless:

(i) such transaction or series of related transactions is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than would reasonably be expected to be available in a
comparable transaction in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated third party, and

(ii) with respect to any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate payments in excess of
$50.0 million, the Company delivers an officers’ certificate to the Trustee certifying that such transaction or series of related
transactions complies with clause (i) above and such transaction or series of related transactions has been approved by a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company (and approved by a majority of the Independent Directors
or, in the event there is only one Independent Director, by such Independent Director).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, this provision will not apply to (i) employment agreements or compensation or employee
benefit arrangements or indemnification agreements or similar arrangements with any officer, director or employee of the Company
(including benefits thereunder), (ii) any transaction entered into by or among the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and one or
more Restricted Subsidiaries, (iii) transactions pursuant to agreements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment to or extensions
or replacements thereof on terms not materially less favorable to the Company, (iv) Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments,
(v) issuances of equity of the Company, (vi) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an independent financial advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause (i) of the preceding paragraph, (vii) payments
by the Company (and any Parent Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax sharing agreements among the Company
(and any such Parent Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent constituting Permitted Tax Distributions, (viii) any customary
transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables Facility and any
disposition of Securitization Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing and any repurchase of
Securitization Assets pursuant to a Securitization Repurchase Obligation, (ix) transactions entered into by a Restricted Subsidiary with
an Affiliate prior to the day such Restricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary (so long as such transaction was not

58


-----

entered into in contemplation of such redesignation) and (x) any transaction or series of related transactions involving aggregate
payments of $25.0 million or less.

**_Limitation on Creation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Company may designate any Subsidiary of the Company to be an_**
“Unrestricted Subsidiary” as provided below, in which event such Subsidiary and each other person that is a Subsidiary of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

“Unrestricted Subsidiary” means:

(1) any Subsidiary that has been previously designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the existing
indentures;

(2) any Subsidiary designated as such by the Board of Directors of the Company as set forth below; and

(3) any Subsidiary of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

The Company may designate any Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Issue Date; provided that the
Company could make a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in an amount equal to the fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of such Subsidiary pursuant to the “— Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant and such
amount is thereafter treated as a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment for the purpose of calculating the amount available in
connection with such covenant.

An Unrestricted Subsidiary may be designated as a Restricted Subsidiary if (i) all the Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary could be incurred under the “— Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness” covenant and (ii) all the Liens on the property
and assets of such Unrestricted Subsidiary could be incurred pursuant to the “— Limitation on Liens” covenant.

As of the Issue Date, the Company has designated the Receivables SPV, Assembly Atlanta, LLC, Burney Nolan, LLC, David
Tennyson, LLC, OLJ Ventures, LLC, Clyde Drive, LLC, Terrell Drive, LLC, Swirl Films, LLC, Branson Visitor TV, LLC and
Paulding Land Investments, LLC and Subsidiaries thereof as Unrestricted Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if any Restricted Subsidiary owns or holds any Material Intellectual Property, such
Restricted Subsidiary may not be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries shall make any Investment in, Restricted Payment to or otherwise dispose of any Material Intellectual Property to, any
Unrestricted Subsidiary (in each case, without regard to whether the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has the right to continue to
utilize any such intellectual property after such transfer); for the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that such restriction
shall not restrict any non- exclusive licenses, sublicenses or cross licenses of rights in intellectual property or any rights in intellectual
property that become Material Intellectual Property subsequent to the acquisition by an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

**_Future Subsidiary Guarantors. The Indenture will provide that the Company shall cause each Restricted Subsidiary of the_**
Company (other than any Foreign Subsidiary or any Securitization Subsidiary) formed (including by operation of or as a result of an
LLC Division) or acquired after the Issue Date that directly or indirectly assumes, becomes a borrower under, guarantees or in any
other manner become liable with respect to any Indebtedness of the Company under the Senior Credit Agreement within 30 days after
such obligation arises to issue a Subsidiary Guarantee and execute and deliver a supplemental indenture to the Indenture pursuant to
which such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor and execute and deliver joinders to the Notes Security Documents
or new Notes Security Documents together with any other filings and amendments required by the Notes Security Documents to
create or perfect the security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral of such Restricted Company;
_provided that the foregoing shall not apply if Acquired Debt incurred under clause (ix)(c) of “— Certain Covenants_ — Limitation on
_Incurrence of Indebtedness” shall prohibit such Subsidiary Guarantee, but only for so long as such Acquired Debt prohibits such_
Subsidiary Guarantee.

**_Reporting. The Indenture will provide that, whether or not the Company is then subject to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the_**
Exchange Act, the Company will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), so long as the Notes are
outstanding, the annual reports, quarterly reports and other periodic reports which the Company would have been required to file with
the Commission pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d) if the Company were so subject, and such documents shall be filed with the
Commission on or prior to the respective dates (the “Required Filing Dates”) by which the Company would have been required so to
file such documents if the Company were so subject. The Company will also, in the event the filing such documents by the Company
with the Commission is not permitted by the Commission, (i) within 15 days of each Required Filing Date, (a) deliver to all Holders of
Notes, as their names and addresses appear in the Note register, without cost to such Holders and (b) file with the Trustee copies of the
annual reports, quarterly reports and other periodic reports which the Company would have been required to file with the Commission

59


-----

pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act if the Company were subject to such Sections and (ii) promptly upon written
request and payment of the reasonable cost of duplication and delivery, supply copies of such documents to any good faith prospective
holder. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Company will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding,
it will furnish to Holders of the Notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered
pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company will not be deemed to have failed to comply with any of its
agreements under this covenant for purposes of clause (iii) under “— Events of Default” until 90 days after the date any report
hereunder is required to be filed with the Commission (or otherwise delivered to the Holders and the Trustee as required pursuant to
the immediately preceding paragraph) pursuant to this covenant.

The Indenture will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information
relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that, the same is accompanied by
consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity, on
the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For
the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Company or any Parent Entity of the Company has furnished
the Holders of Notes or filed with the Commission the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Company or
any Parent Entity, the Company shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant.

**Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets**

The Indenture will provide that the Company shall not consolidate or merge with or into (whether or not the Company is the
surviving Person), or, directly or indirectly through one or more Restricted Subsidiaries, sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, for the avoidance of doubt
including by way of an LLC Division, to another Person or Persons unless (i) the surviving Person is a corporation or limited liability
company or limited partnership organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
_provided that at any time the Company or its successor is not a corporation, there shall be a co-issuer of the Notes that is a corporation;_
(ii) the surviving Person (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of the Company under the Notes, the Indenture
pursuant to a supplemental indenture and the Notes Security Documents by joinder, in each case in a form reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable; (iii) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing; (iv) except in connection with a transaction solely in connection with the creation of a Parent Entity, at
the time of such transaction and after giving pro forma effect thereto (other than a merger with a wholly-owned Subsidiary or for
purposes of reincorporating into another state), the surviving Person would (a) be permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Incurrence of
_Indebtedness” or (b) have a Debt to Operating Cash Flow Ratio immediately after the transaction that is no greater than the_
Company’s Debt to Operating Cash Flow Ratio immediately prior to the transaction; (v) to the extent any assets of the Person which is
consolidated or merged with or into the surviving Person are assets of the type which would constitute Collateral under the Notes
Security Documents, the surviving Person will take such action as may be reasonably necessary to cause such property and assets to
be made subject to the Lien of the Notes Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required in the Indenture or any of the
Notes Security Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien is perfected to the extent required by the
Notes Security Documents; and (vi) the Collateral owned by or transferred to the surviving Person shall: (a) continue to constitute
Collateral under the Indenture and the Notes Security Documents, (b) be subject to the Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the Notes, and (c) not be subject to any Lien other than Permitted Liens.

In the event of any transaction (other than a lease of all or substantially all assets) described in the immediately preceding
paragraph in which the Company is not the surviving Person and the surviving Person is to assume all the obligations of the Company
under the Notes and the Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture and the Notes Security Documents pursuant to a joinder, such
surviving Person shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company, and the Company
shall be discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; provided that solely for the purpose of calculating amounts
described in clause (iii) under “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any such surviving Person shall only be
deemed to have succeeded to and be substituted for the Company with respect to the period subsequent to the effective time of such
transaction (and the Company (before giving effect to such transaction) shall be deemed to be the “Company” for such purposes for all
prior periods).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Transactions and the other transactions constituting or related to the Transactions will be
permitted without compliance with this section entitled “Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets.”

**Events of Default**

The Indenture will provide that each of the following constitutes an Event of Default:

(i) a default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on any Note;

(ii) a default in the payment when due of principal on any Note, whether upon maturity, acceleration, optional

-----

Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary (x) consents to the filing of such petition or the
appointment of or taking possession by, a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, sequestrator or other similar
official of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or a group of
Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary or of any substantial part of their
respective property, (y) makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors or (z) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they become due or (e) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary takes any
corporate action in furtherance of any such actions in this paragraph (viii); or

(ix) so long as the Notes Security Documents have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their terms or
the Collateral as a whole of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has not otherwise been released from the Lien of the
Notes Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, (a) default by the Company or any such Subsidiary
Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes in the performance of any covenant under the Notes Security Documents which
materially adversely effects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Lien on the Collateral securing the
Obligations with respect to the Notes or which materially adversely affects the condition or value of the Collateral, in each
case, taken as a whole, (b) repudiation or disaffirmation by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any of its material
obligations under the Notes Security Documents or (c) the determination in a judicial proceeding that all or any material
portion of the Notes Security Documents, taken as a whole, are unenforceable or invalid, for any reason, against the
Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any material portion of the Collateral.

However, a default under clause (iv) or (vi) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the
Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default.

If any Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of the preceding paragraph with respect to the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries
of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately. In the case of an Event of Default arising from the events specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of
the preceding paragraph with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary, the principal of,
premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all outstanding Notes shall ipso facto become immediately due and payable
without further action or notice.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all the
Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except (i) a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (which may only be waived with the
consent of each Holder of Notes affected), or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from
Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the
payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

Any notice of a Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of
acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank)
(each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company and
the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction
relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured
or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a
Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from
time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a
“Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification
Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

62


-----

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation
and provides to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction
seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to
invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default
shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any
remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an officers’ certificate
stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be
automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction
shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the
Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the
participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would
have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect
that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have
received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee
during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the
foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a
Regulated Bank.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the
Company is required, within 10 days of becoming aware of any Default which has not been timely cured or Event of Default, to
deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

**Defeasance**

The Company may, at its option and at anytime, elect to have the obligations of the Company discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees (“legal defeasance”). Such legal defeasance means that the Company and the
Subsidiary Guarantors shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes and
the Subsidiary Guarantees and to have satisfied all other obligations under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Indenture,
except for (i) the rights of Holders of the outstanding Notes to receive, solely from the trust fund described below, payments in respect
of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (ii) the Company’s obligations with
respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, and money
for security payments held in trust, (iii) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture and (iv) the
defeasance provisions of the Indenture. In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of
the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“covenant
**_defeasance’) and any omission to comply with such obligations shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to_**
the Notes.

In order to exercise either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, (i) the Company shall irrevocably deposit with the
Trustee, as trust funds in trust for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes, cash in United States dollars, U.S. Government Obligations,
or a combination thereof, maturing as to principal and interest in such amounts as will be sufficient, without consideration of any
reinvestment of such interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or a nationally
recognized investment banking firm or financial advisory firm, to pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on
the outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or interest; (ii) in the case of legal
defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee confirming that (A) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or
(B) since the date of the Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that,
and based thereon such opinion of counsel shall confirm that, the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or
loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such legal defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such legal defeasance had not occurred; (iii) in the
case of covenant defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the United States reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the beneficial owners of the Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income
tax purposes as a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred; (iv) no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of such deposit (other than the Indenture solely with respect to the making

63


-----

of the deposit or the incurrence of Indebtedness in connection therewith); (v) such legal defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a Default under any other material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Company is a party or by which it is bound; (vi) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate
stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the Holders of the Notes over the other creditors of
the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and (vii) the
Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for relating to either the legal defeasance or the covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with.

The Collateral will be released automatically from the Lien securing the Notes, as provided under the caption “—Release of
Liens on Collateral” and the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be released upon a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance
in accordance with the provisions described above.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of registration, transfer or exchange of the
Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (i) either (a) all the Notes theretofore authenticated
and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes which have been replaced or paid) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation or (b) all Notes not theretofore delivered for cancellation (x) have become due and payable or (y) will become due and
payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (z) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense of, the Company; and
the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust
an amount in United States dollars or direct obligations of, or obligations the principal of and interest on which are unconditionally
guaranteed by, the United States of America (or by any agency thereof to the extent such obligations are backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America), in each case, maturing prior to the date the Notes will have become due and payable, the
Stated Maturity of the Notes or the relevant redemption date of the Notes, as the case may be, sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
indebtedness on the Notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, including principal of, premium, if any, and
accrued interest at maturity, Stated Maturity or redemption date; and (ii) the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has paid or caused
to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture by the Company and any Subsidiary Guarantor; and (iii) the Company has
delivered to the Trustee an officers’ certificate and an opinion of counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the Indenture
relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with and that such satisfaction and discharge will not
result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to
which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is bound.

The Collateral will be released automatically from the Lien securing the Notes, as provided under the caption “—Release of
Liens on Collateral” and the Guarantee of the Subsidiary Guarantors will be released upon satisfaction and discharge in accordance
with the provisions described above.

**Modifications and Amendments**

Modifications and amendments of the Indenture, the Notes or the Notes Security Documents may be made by the Company,
the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, if applicable, with the written consent of the Holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes; provided, however, without the consent of the Holder of each
outstanding Note affected thereby, no such modification or amendment may (with respect to any Notes held by a nonconsenting
Holder): (i) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of interest on, any Note, or reduce the principal amount
thereof or the rate of interest thereon or any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change the coin or currency or the
manner in which the principal of any Note or any premium or the interest thereon is payable (for avoidance of doubt excluding any
waiver, elimination or modification of provisions relating to an offer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or an
Asset Sale Offer), or impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment after the stated maturity thereof (or, in
the case of redemption, on or after the redemption date); (ii) extend the time for payment of interest on the Notes; (iii) reduce the
premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which such Note may be redeemed, in each case as
described above under “— Redemption — Optional Redemption” (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of all
clauses herein, any change to advance notice provisions); (iv) reduce the percentage in principal amount of outstanding Notes, the
consent of whose Holders is required for any amended or supplemental indenture or the consent of whose Holders is required for any
waiver of compliance with any provision of the Indenture or any Default thereunder and their consequences provided for in the
Indenture; (v) modify any of the provisions of the Indenture relating to any amended or supplemental indentures requiring the consent
of Holders or relating to the waiver of past defaults or relating to the waiver of any covenant, except to increase the percentage of
outstanding Notes required for such actions or to provide that any other provision of the Indenture cannot be modified or waived

64


-----

without the consent of the Holder of each Note affected thereby; (vi) modify the ranking of the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee
(including subordinating, or having the effect of subordinating, the right of payment with respect to the Notes or the Liens securing the
Obligations with respect to the Notes); or (vii) release any Subsidiary Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Subsidiary
Guarantee other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of Notes, the Company, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the
Trustee and the Collateral Agent, if applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Security Documents or
the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (for the avoidance of doubt, existing subsidiaries need not execute any amendment or
supplement pursuant to clause (vi) or (vii) below) to (i) cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, (ii) provide for uncertificated
Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, (iii) provide for the assumption of the Company’s obligations to the Holders of
the Notes in the event of any transaction involving the Company that is permitted under the provisions of “— Merger, Consolidation
_and Sale of Assets” in which the Company is not the surviving Person, (iv) make any change that would provide any additional rights_
or benefits to the Holders of the Notes or does not adversely affect the legal rights of any Holder, (v) comply with the requirements of
the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, (vi) add additional
Subsidiary Guarantors, (vii) to release a Subsidiary Guarantor from its Guarantee when permitted by the Indenture, (viii) add
additional assets as Collateral, (ix) make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted or required by the Indenture or any of
the Notes Security Documents or any release, termination or discharge of Collateral that becomes effective as set forth in the
Indenture or any of the Notes Security Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, (x) release Collateral in accordance with
the Indenture, the Notes Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement when permitted or required by the Indenture,
the Notes Security Documents or the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or (xi) conform the Indenture, the Notes, the First Lien
Intercreditor Agreement or the applicable Notes Security Documents to provisions of this Description of Notes to the extent such
provision was intended to be a substantially verbatim recitation thereof.

**The Trustee and the Collateral Agent**

In the event that the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company, the Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the
Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security
or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee, or resign.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture
will provide that, in case an Event of Default has occurred and has not been cured, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its
power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any Holder of Notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the
Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent shall be responsible for and make no representation as to the existence,
genuineness, value or protection of any Collateral, for the legality, effectiveness or sufficiency of any Notes Security Document, or for
the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any Liens securing the Notes. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral
Agent shall be responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public
office at any time or times or otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any Lien or security interest in the Collateral.

By their acceptance of the Notes, the Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Collateral
Agent to enter into and perform any Notes Security Documents, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any other intercreditor
agreements to which it is a party.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees or Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, as such, will have
any liability for any obligations of the Company or the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary
Guarantees, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Notes by
accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes.
The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

financial statements are available (as determined in good faith by the Company).

“Transactions” means the transactions contemplated by or related to the issuance of the Notes, borrowings under the Senior

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership and
disposition of the notes. It is not a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relating to the notes. This summary is based
upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code, and currently
effective administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as in effect on the date of this offering memorandum and all of which are
subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax considerations
materially and adversely different from those set forth below. This discussion is limited to beneficial owners of the notes who
purchase the notes upon their initial issuance at the notes’ “issue price” (which is the first price at which a substantial amount of the
notes is sold for cash to investors, excluding sales to the initial purchasers or to similar persons acting in the capacity of underwriters,
placement agents or wholesalers) and who will hold the notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

This summary does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any foreign, state or local jurisdiction or any
U.S. federal tax law other than U.S. federal income tax law (such as estate and gift tax law). In addition, this discussion does not
address all tax considerations that may be applicable to holders’ particular circumstances (such as the effects of rules requiring certain
holders to accelerate the recognition of any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable
financial statement) or to holders that may be subject to special tax rules, such as, for example:

    - holders subject to the alternative minimum tax;

    - banks, insurance companies, or other financial institutions;

    - regulated investment companies;

    - real estate investment trusts;

    - tax-exempt entities;

    - brokers and dealers in securities or commodities;

    - U.S. expatriates;

    - traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;

    - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

    - U.S. Holders who hold the notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries;

    - persons that will hold the notes as a position in a hedging transaction, straddle, conversion transaction or other risk
reduction transaction;

    - persons deemed to sell the notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code;

    - “controlled foreign corporations” and “passive foreign investment companies”;

    - entities or arrangements classified as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass-through entities, or
investors in such entities; and

    - persons that participate in this offering and are also lenders under the 2019 Term Loan that is being refinanced with the
net proceeds of this offering, as described above in “Use of Proceeds.”

If an entity or arrangement classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the notes, the tax treatment
of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a
partner of a partnership that will hold the notes, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of your
acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes.

**You should consult your own tax advisor with respect to the application of U.S. federal and other applicable income**
**tax laws to your particular situation as well as any tax consequences arising under other U.S. federal tax rules (such as estate**
**or gift tax rules) or under the laws of any state, local, foreign or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

Under certain circumstances, we may become obligated to make payments on the notes in excess of stated principal and
interest. For example, we will become required to pay 101% of the face amount of any note purchased by us at the holder’s election

92


-----

after a change of control, as described above under the heading “Description of Notes — Change of Control.” The obligation to make
these payments may implicate the provisions of the Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments.

Treasury regulations provide special rules for contingent payment debt instruments which, if applicable, could cause the
timing, amount and character of a holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the notes to be different from the consequences
discussed herein. Under the applicable Treasury regulations, however, for purposes of determining whether a debt instrument is a
contingent payment debt instrument, remote or incidental contingencies (determined in the aggregate as of the date the notes are
issued) are ignored. We believe that the possibility of making such additional payments is, in the aggregate, remote and/or incidental.
Accordingly, we do not intend to treat the notes as contingent payment debt instruments. Our position is binding on a holder subject to
U.S. federal income taxation unless such holder discloses on its tax return that such holder is taking a contrary position. This position
is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), which may take a contrary position and treat the notes as contingent
payment debt instruments. If the IRS were to challenge our treatment, a holder might be required to accrue ordinary income on the
notes in excess of stated interest and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a disposition of the
notes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the notes are not treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**Consequences to U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of the general U.S. federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a “U.S.
Holder” of the notes. As used in this offering memorandum, a “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a note that is, or is treated
for U.S. federal income tax purposes as:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust that (1) is subject to the supervision of a court within the United States, if one or more United States persons (as
defined in the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or (2) has a valid election in effect
under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

**_Interest_**

Stated interest on the notes will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance
with your regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the notes are issued at a discount that equals or
exceeds a statutory “de minimis” amount (i.e., 0.25% of the principal amount of the notes multiplied by the number of complete years
to maturity), the notes will be considered to be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is
anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the notes will be issued at par or at a discount that is less than the “de minimis” amount
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize taxable gain or loss
equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized on such disposition (except to the extent any amount realized is
attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will taxed as ordinary income to the extent not previously included in income)
and your adjusted tax basis in the note. Your adjusted tax basis in a note generally will equal your cost for the note. Any gain or loss
recognized on the disposition of a note generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of
such disposition, your holding period for the note is more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate taxpayers are
generally eligible for preferential rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

**_Surtax on Net Investment Income_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals, estates or trusts will be subject to a 3.8% surtax on the lesser of (i) the U.S.
Holder’s “net investment income” for the relevant taxable year (or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or
trust) and (ii) the excess of the U.S. Holder’s modified adjusted gross income (or adjusted gross income, in the case of an estate or
trust) for the relevant taxable year over a certain threshold. A U.S. Holder’s net investment income generally will include its gross
interest income and its net gains from a disposition of the notes, unless such interest income or net gains are derived in the ordinary
course of the conduct of a trade or business (other than a trade or business that consists of certain passive or trading activities). You
should consult your own tax advisor regarding the applicability of this surtax to your income and gains in respect of your investment
in the notes.

93


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of interest and the proceeds of certain sales and other
taxable dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of the notes unless you are an exempt recipient. Backup withholding
(currently at a rate of 24%) will apply to such payments if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number or certification of
exempt status or have been notified by the IRS that payments to you are subject to backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a credit against your U.S.
federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided that you furnish the required information to the IRS on a timely
basis.

**Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders**

As used in this offering memorandum, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of the notes that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust and is not a U.S. Holder.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the discussions below regarding backup withholding and FATCA (as defined below), payments of interest on the
notes to you generally will be exempt from U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax under the “portfolio interest” exemption if
you properly certify as to your foreign status (as described below) and:

    - you do not conduct a trade or business within the United States to which the interest income is effectively connected;

    - you are not a “10-percent shareholder” of us within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code;

    - you are not a “controlled foreign corporation” that is related to us through stock ownership; and

    - you are not a bank that receives such interest in a transaction described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code.

The portfolio interest exemption generally applies only if you appropriately certify as to your foreign status. You can
generally meet this certification requirement by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as
applicable, or applicable successor form, to the applicable withholding agent certifying that you are not a United States person. If you
hold the notes through a securities clearing organization, financial institution or other agent acting on your behalf, you may be
required to provide appropriate certifications to such agent. Your agent will then generally be required to provide appropriate
certifications to the applicable withholding agent, either directly or through other intermediaries.

If you cannot satisfy the requirements described above for the portfolio interest exemption, payments of interest made to you
on the notes will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless you provide the applicable withholding agent either with
(1) a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or applicable successor form, establishing an
exemption from (or a reduction of) withholding under the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty or (2) a properly executed IRS
Form W-8ECI, or applicable successor form, certifying that interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax because the
interest is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (as discussed below under “— Interest or
_Gain Effectively Connected with a United States Trade or Business”)._

**_Sale, Exchange, Redemption, Retirement or Other Taxable Disposition of the Notes_**

Subject to the discussions of backup withholding and FATCA below, you generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income
or withholding tax on any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if an income tax
treaty applies, is attributable to your permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States); or

    - you are an individual who has been present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition
and certain other requirements are met.

If you recognized gain described in the first bullet point above, see “— Interest or Gain Effectively Connected with a United
_States Trade or Business” below. If you are described in the second bullet point, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income_
tax at a rate of 30% on the amount by which your capital gains allocable to U.S. sources, including gain from such disposition, exceed
certain capital losses allocable to U.S. sources, except as otherwise required by an applicable income tax treaty.

94


-----

To the extent that any amount realized on a sale, redemption, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the notes is
attributable to accrued but unpaid interest on the notes, this amount generally will be treated in the same manner as described in “—
_Payments of Interest” above._

**_Interest or Gain Effectively Connected with a United States Trade or Business_**

If you are engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and interest on a note or gain recognized from a
sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or
business, you will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax (but not the surtax on net investment income described above or the
30% U.S. federal withholding tax on interest if certain certification requirements are satisfied) on that interest or gain on a net income
basis in the same manner as if you were a United States person as defined under the Code, unless an applicable income tax treaty
provides otherwise. You can generally meet the certification requirements by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8ECI (or
other applicable successor form), to the applicable withholding agent. If you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty
between the United States and your country of residence, any effectively connected interest or gain generally will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax only if it is also attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by you in the United States. In
addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30% (or a lower applicable income tax
treaty rate) of your earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to adjustments, that are effectively connected with your conduct
of a trade or business in the United States.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Generally, information returns will be filed with the IRS in connection with payments of interest on the notes and proceeds
from a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of the notes. Copies of the information returns reporting
such payments and any withholding may also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which you reside or are
established under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or agreement. You may be subject to backup withholding of tax on
payments of interest and, depending on the circumstances, the proceeds of a sale or other taxable disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) unless you comply with certain certification procedures to establish that you are not a United States person or you are
otherwise exempt from backup withholding. The certification procedures required to claim an exemption from withholding of tax on
interest described above generally will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid backup withholding as well. Backup
withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will generally be allowed as a credit
against your U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided that you furnish the required information to the
IRS on a timely basis. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the application of backup withholding rules in your
particular situation, the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption, if
applicable.

**FATCA**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations and administrative guidance issued
thereunder (“FATCA”), “foreign financial institutions” (as defined in the Code and which term includes most foreign hedge funds,
private equity funds, mutual funds, securitization vehicles and other investment vehicles) and certain other “non-financial foreign
entities” (as defined in the Code) generally must comply with certain information reporting rules with respect to their U.S. account
holders and investors. A foreign financial institution or such other non-financial foreign entity that does not comply with the FATCA
reporting requirements will generally be subject to a 30% withholding tax with respect to any “withholdable payments” (whether
received as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary for another party). For this purpose, withholdable payments generally include
U.S.-source payments otherwise subject to nonresident withholding tax (e.g., U.S.-source interest) and, subject to the discussion
below, the entire gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of any debt instruments of U.S. issuers, even if the payment would
otherwise not be subject to U.S. nonresident withholding tax (e.g., because it is capital gain), unless (i) in the case of a foreign
financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to report certain information regarding its
accounts with or interests held by certain United States persons and by certain non-U.S. entities that are wholly or partially owned by
United States persons, and to withhold on certain payments to such persons, and establishes its compliance with these rules by
providing the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or other IRS Form W-8, as applicable
(or applicable successor form), (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity provides the applicable withholding agent
with certain documentation relating to its substantial U.S. owners or otherwise certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S.
owners, or (iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules
and establishes such exemption by providing the applicable withholding agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form W-8BEN-E, or
other IRS Form W-8, as applicable (or applicable successor form). The IRS issued proposed Treasury regulations that would eliminate
the application of this regime with respect to payments of gross proceeds (but not interest). Pursuant to the preamble to these proposed
Treasury regulations, we and any other applicable withholding agent may (but are not required to) rely on this proposed change to
FATCA withholding until final Treasury regulations are issued or until such proposed Treasury regulations are rescinded. Foreign

95


-----

financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may
be subject to different rules.

We will not be obligated to make any “gross up” or additional payments in respect of any amounts withheld, including
pursuant to FATCA. Under certain circumstances, a Non-U.S. Holder may be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Non-U.S.
Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of FATCA to them based on their particular
circumstances.

96


-----

**BOOK ENTRY DELIVERY AND FORM**

The certificates representing the notes will be issued in fully registered form without interest coupons. Notes sold in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act initially will be represented by a permanent global note in fully registered form without interest
coupons (the “Restricted Global Note”) and will be deposited with the trustee as a custodian for The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”), as depositary, and registered in the name of a nominee of such depositary.

Notes sold in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act initially will be represented by global
notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (each, a “Regulation S Global Note”) and together with the Restricted Global
Note, the “Global Notes”) and will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC, as depositary, and registered in the name of a
nominee of such depositary. Prior to the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this offering and the closing of this offering
(such period through and including such 40th day, the “distribution compliance period”), a beneficial interest in the Regulation S
Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Restricted Global Note only upon
receipt by the trustee of a written certification from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the
transferor reasonably believes is a qualified institutional buyer (a “QIB”), in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A.
Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in a
Regulation S Global Note whether before, on or after such time, only upon receipt by the trustee of a written certification to the effect
that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S.

The Global Notes (and any notes issued in exchange therefor) will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer set forth
therein and in the indenture and will bear the legend regarding such restrictions set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors”
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. QIBs or non-U.S. purchasers may elect to take a Certificated Security (as defined
below under “— Certificated Securities”) instead of holding their interests through the Global Notes, which certificated notes will be
ineligible to trade through DTC (collectively referred to herein as the “Non-Global Purchasers”) only in the limited circumstances
described below. Upon the transfer to a QIB of any Certificated Security initially issued to a Non-Global Purchaser, such Certificated
Security will, unless the transferee requests otherwise or the Global Notes have previously been exchanged in whole for Certificated
Securities, be exchanged for an interest in the Global Notes. For a description of the restrictions on transfer of Certificated Securities
and any interest in the Global Notes, see “Notice to Investors” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**The Global Notes**

We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian
will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global
Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained
by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons
other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial
interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their
interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are
participants in such system.

So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will
be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing
the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s
procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes.

Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes
will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the issuer, the trustee or any paying
agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial
ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership
interest.

We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest
(including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to
their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We
also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be
governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers
registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants.

97


-----

Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in
accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security (as
defined below), such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes
for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global
Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, DTC
will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set
forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.”

DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking
organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation”
within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of
Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and
municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales
and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between
participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and
non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the
DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among
participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None
of us, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect
participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Certificated Securities**

A Global Note is exchangeable for certificated notes in fully registered form without interest coupons (“Certificated
**_Securities”) only in the following limited circumstances:_**

    - DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Note and we fail to appoint a
successor depositary within 90 days of such notice; or

    - there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default with respect to the notes under the indenture and DTC
shall have requested the issuance of Certificated Securities.

Certificated Securities may not be exchanged for beneficial interests in any Global Note unless the transferor first delivers to
the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture governing the notes) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Notice to Investors” included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. In no event shall the Regulation S Global Note be exchanged for Certificated Securities prior to (a) the expiration of the
distribution compliance period and (b) the receipt of any certificates required under the provisions of Regulation S.

The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own.
Consequently, the ability to transfer the notes will be limited to such extent.

**Exchanges Between Regulation S Notes and Restricted Global Notes**

Prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period, beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note may be
exchanged for beneficial interests in the Restricted Global Note only if:

(1) such exchange occurs in connection with a transfer of the notes pursuant to Rule 144A; and

(2) the transferor first delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that
the notes are being transferred to a person:

98


-----

(a) who the transferor reasonably believes to be a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule
144A;

(b) purchasing for its own account or the account of a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A; and

(c) in accordance with all applicable securities laws of the states of the United States and other jurisdictions.

Beneficial interests in a Restricted Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in
the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the distribution compliance period, only if the transferor first
delivers to the trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture governing the notes) to the effect that such transfer is
being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the
expiration of the distribution compliance period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or
Clearstream.

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes
will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system.
Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as
applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an
interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the
other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial
interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest. The policies and practices of DTC may prohibit transfers
of beneficial interests in the Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the distribution compliance period.

Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ..................................................................................................................
BofA Securities, Inc. ..............................................................................................................................

TCBI Securities, Inc. ..............................................................................................................................
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ................................................................................................................
Total ....................................................................................................................................................... $    1,000,000,000

The purchase agreement provides that the obligation of the initial purchasers to purchase the notes is subject to certain
conditions precedent and that the initial purchasers are committed to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. We and the
guarantors have agreed to indemnify the initial purchasers and their controlling persons against certain liabilities in connection with
this offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to
make in respect thereof.

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they initially propose to offer and sell the notes at the price set forth on
the cover page of this offering memorandum. If all of the notes are not sold at the initial offering price, the initial purchasers may
change the offering price and other selling terms without notice. The initial purchasers reserve the right to reject, cancel or modify an
order of notes in whole or in part.

The initial purchasers propose to offer the notes for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act
or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The initial purchasers will not offer
or sell the notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A, or pursuant
to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the Securities
Act. Each purchaser of the notes in making its purchase will be deemed, by its purchase, to have made certain acknowledgments,
representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under the section entitled “Notice to Investors” included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

In connection with sales outside the U.S., the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the notes
to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as a part of the initial purchasers’ distribution at any time or (2) otherwise until 40
days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date the notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to
each dealer to whom they sell such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the notes within the U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act and may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Certain
of the initial purchasers have advised us that following the completion of this offering, they presently intend to make a market in the
notes. They are not obligated to do so, however, and any market-making activities with respect to the notes may be discontinued at
any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance as to the development of any market or the liquidity of any market for the
notes.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”);
(ii) a customer within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor

100


-----

as defined in Directive 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended or superseded, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the notes or otherwise
making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been
prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation or any relevant implementing measure in each Member State of the EEA.

**Prohibition of Sales to United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive
(EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK
has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may
be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

This offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who

(1) have professional experience in matters relating to investments and who qualify as investment professionals within
the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as
amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”);

(2) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of
the Financial Promotion Order;

(3) are outside the UK; or

(4) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21
of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or
caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

This offering is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant
persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be
engaged in only with relevant persons.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in Canada**

The notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing, or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors,
as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are
permitted clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant
_Obligations. Any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the_
prospectus requirements of applicable securities laws.

Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or
damages if this offering memorandum (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for
rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s
province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province
or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105), the initial purchasers are not
required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this
offering.

101


-----

We and the guarantors have each agreed that for a period of 30 days from the pricing date of this offering, we will not,
without the prior written consent of Truist Securities, Inc., directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale
of, or otherwise dispose of, any securities similar to the notes, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for the notes or any
such similar securities, except for the notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the purchase agreement.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect
the price of the notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot this offering, creating a syndicate short position. The initial
purchasers may bid for and purchase the notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions. In addition, the initial purchasers
may bid for and purchase the notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the notes. These activities may stabilize or maintain the
market price of the notes above independent market levels. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in these activities and
may end these activities at any time.

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which
may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment,
hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have
provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, securities trading, hedging, brokerage activities, commercial
lending and financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business to us, certain of our guarantors and certain of our affiliates,
for which they receive customary fees and expenses reimbursement. Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates)
may hold positions in the 2026 Notes that we intend to purchase in the Tender Offer with the net proceeds from this offering, and
these entities would receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering as tender offer consideration if they tender their 2026
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer. Truist Securities, Inc., BofA Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC
are the joint dealer managers under the Tender Offer and will receive customary expense reimbursement and indemnity in accordance
therewith. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are agents, arrangers and/or lenders under our Senior Credit
Agreement. Each of the initial purchasers, either themselves or acting through their affiliates, will serve as arrangers, agents and/or
lenders for the Third Amendment (including the 2024 Term Loan, increased revolving credit facility, and extended revolving credit
facility thereunder). See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may be lenders under the 2019 Term Loan and therefore would
receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a
broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments
(including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may
involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. To the extent the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending
relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain others of the initial purchasers may
hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the
creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may
hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about       , 2024, which is
the    business day following the date of pricing of the notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1
of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any
such trade expressly agree otherwise. Effective May 28, 2024, the standard settlement cycle under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act
will be shortened from two business days to one business day. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes prior to the date that is
business day prior to the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will not initially settle in T+ , to specify
an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisors.

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

The notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any securities laws of any jurisdiction, and may not be offered
or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons (as such terms are defined under the Securities Act), except pursuant to an

persons who will be required to make certain representations to us and others prior to an investment in the notes.

Each purchaser of the notes that is purchasing in a sale made in reliance on Rule 144A or Regulation S will be deemed to
have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) The purchaser:

and (ii) is acquiring the notes for its own account or for the account of another qualified institutional buyer,

institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A, in a transaction meeting the

requirements of Rule 904 under the Securities Act, or in accordance with another exemption from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act (and based upon an opinion of counsel, if we so request), (ii)
to us or (iii) pursuant to an effective registration statement and, in each case, in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction, and

(b) the purchaser will, and each subsequent holder is required to, notify any subsequent purchaser from it of the
resale restrictions set forth in (a) above.

(3) The purchaser confirms that:

(a) such purchaser has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the notes and that such purchaser and any accounts for which

(b) such purchaser is not acquiring the notes with a view towards any distribution thereof in a transaction that
would violate the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state of the United States or any other

(c) such purchaser has received a copy of this offering memorandum and acknowledges that such purchaser
has had access to such financial and other information and has been afforded an opportunity to ask such
questions of our representatives and receive answers thereto as it has deemed necessary in connection with
its decision to purchase the notes.

(4) The purchaser understands that the certificates evidencing the notes will, unless otherwise agreed by us and the

JURISDICTION AND (B) THE HOLDER WILL, AND EACH SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, NOTIFY ANY
PURCHASER OF THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY OF THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN CLAUSE
(A) ABOVE. NO REPRESENTATION CAN BE MADE AS TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED BY
RULE 144 FOR RESALE OF THE SECURITY EVIDENCED HEREBY.”

(5) Either (i) the purchaser is not acquiring or holding such notes with the assets of (A) an “employee benefit plan” (as

federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or
the Code (“Similar Law”); or (ii) the acquisition and holding of such notes by the purchaser will not constitute or
result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar
violation under any applicable Similar Law, and none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary of such purchaser in
connection with its investment in such notes pursuant to the offering described in this offering memorandum.
“Transaction Party” means any of the Company, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates, other than an
affiliate of an initial purchaser that is a named fiduciary (or a fiduciary appointed by a named fiduciary) with respect
to the management of the assets of the applicable Plan and acting in accordance with an applicable individual
prohibited transaction exemption (the applicable conditions of which are satisfied).

(6) The purchaser acknowledges that we and the initial purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of
the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements and agrees that, if any of the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations and agreements deemed to have been made by it are no longer accurate, it will
promptly notify the initial purchasers. If such purchaser is acquiring the notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more
investor accounts, such purchaser represents that it has sole investment discretion with respect to each such account
and that it has full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and agreements on behalf of
each such account.
