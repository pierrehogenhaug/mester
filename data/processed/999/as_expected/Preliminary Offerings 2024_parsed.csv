This metric is calculated as specified in our Senior Credit Agreement and is the denominator of a formula used to calculate material financial covenants within the Senior Credit Agreement. These covenants govern our ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments and make restricted payments, among other limitations usual and customary for credit agreements of this type.

We use Free Cash Flow to approximate amounts of liquidity available to us to repay indebtedness, make investments, restricted payments and other general corporate uses of liquidity. Leverage Ratio Denominator and Free Cash Flow give effect to the revenue and broadcast expenses of all completed acquisitions and divestitures as if they had been acquired or divested, respectively, on April 1, 2022. They also give effect to certain operating synergies expected from the acquisitions and related financings and adds back professional fees incurred in completing the acquisitions.

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to an Investment in the Notes,13.1.3,"A court could void the notes, our subsidiaries’ guarantees of the notes, and the related security interests under fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws.","Federal and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes may apply to the issuance of the notes and the incurrence of the guarantees of the notes and the related security interests. Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or the guarantees thereof and the related grant of the security interests could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the notes, incurred the guarantee or granted the security interests with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes, incurring the guarantee or granting the security interests and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: 12 ----- - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, was or were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes, the incurrence of the guarantee or the grant of the security interests; - the issuance of the notes, the incurrence of the guarantee or the grant of the security interests left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business as engaged in or contemplated; or - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as such debts mature. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or its guarantee and the grant of the security interests to the extent we or such guarantor did not obtain a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes. Specifically, if the guarantees were legally challenged, it may be asserted (and a court may consequently determine) that the guarantors incurred their guarantees for our benefit and did not themselves receive a direct or indirect benefit from the issuance of the notes, such that they incurred the obligations under the guarantees for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens) or security interests, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing considerations varies depending on the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied in any such proceeding, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or any of the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or that a court would agree with our conclusions that we and the guarantors are not insolvent or will not be rendered insolvent as a result of the issuance of the notes and the guarantees, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes, the guarantees or the grant of the security interests would not be voided or otherwise subordinated to our or any of our guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. Each guarantee and security interest will contain a provision intended to limit the guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee and security interest to be a fraudulent transfer. This provision may not be effective to protect the guarantees or the security interests from being voided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. To the extent that any of the guarantees or security interests is voided, then, as to that subsidiary, the guarantee nor the grant of the security interests will be enforceable. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes, the incurrence of a guarantee or the grant of a security interest was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes, that guarantee or that grant of security interest, could subordinate the notes, that guarantee or that grant of security interest to presently existing and future indebtedness of ours or of the related guarantor or could require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee or that security interest. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes.

The value of the assets pledged as Collateral for the notes could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic conditions, competition 14 ----- or other future trends. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the issuance of the notes and the value of the Collateral at any time is subject to fluctuations that will depend on market and other economic conditions, including the availability of suitable buyers for the Collateral. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, no assurance can be given that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral (or other consideration or currency provided in connection with claims relating to the Collateral during or as a result of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency or reorganization proceeding) will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis), in full or at all, after first satisfying our obligations in full under claims that are effectively senior to the notes, if any. Moreover, the lenders under the Senior Credit Agreement will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the notes, thereby diluting the Collateral coverage. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral will be saleable and, even if saleable, the timing of its liquidation would be uncertain. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by the holders of the notes from the sale of the Collateral securing the notes and the obligations under the notes and other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured indebtedness and other unsecured obligations, including trade and other payables. In addition, in any U.S. bankruptcy proceeding with respect to us or any of the guarantors, it is possible that we, as debtor in possession, any trustee in bankruptcy, or competing creditors will assert that the fair market value of the Collateral with respect to the notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing is less than the then-current principal amount of the notes and all of our and the guarantor’s other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis. In the event that the notes were under-collateralized at the time of such Collateral valuation (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari _passu basis), the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim in an_ amount equal to the value of the Collateral and an unsecured claim with respect to the remainder of its claim, which would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the Collateral. The consequences of such under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees, including attorneys’ fees, expenses, and costs, and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under U.S. bankruptcy laws. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at any time prior to such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments would be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes. Thus, in the event that a bankruptcy case is commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and all other senior secured obligations, including the Senior Credit Agreement (and any future pari passu obligations) interest, fees, and expenses would cease to accrue on the notes from and after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral (or other consideration or currency provided in connection with claims relating to the Collateral during or as a result of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency or reorganization proceeding) will be sufficient to pay the obligations due under the notes (after taking into account our and the guarantors’ other obligations that are secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis). Additionally, in the event that a bankruptcy or other court of competent jurisdiction were to determine that the obligations in connection with the notes are unenforceable, subordinated, not subject to valid perfected security interests or intervening security interests, then the value of the Collateral may be impaired to the extent of such ruling with respect to the notes. The Collateral Agent’s ability to foreclose will also be limited by the need to meet certain requirements, such as obtaining third party consents and making additional filings, including as discussed in “—The right of the Collateral Agent to foreclose upon and sell the Collateral after an event of default has occurred may also be subject to limitations under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”) and the regulations under the FCC”. If we fail to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may not be perfected and the holders will not be entitled to realize on the Collateral or any recovery with respect thereto. We cannot assure any holder of the notes that any such required consents can be obtained on a timely basis or at all. These requirements may limit the number of potential bidders for certain Collateral in any foreclosure and may delay any sale, either of which events may have an adverse effect on the sale price of the Collateral. Therefore, the practical value of realizing on the Collateral by the Collateral Agent, subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, may, without the appropriate consents and filings, be limited. The indenture will also permit the Company and the guarantors to create or suffer to exist additional liens on the Collateral, including liens on excluded property, under specified circumstances, some of which liens may be pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the notes. Any obligations secured by such liens may further limit the recovery from the realization of or foreclosure on the Collateral available to satisfy holders of the notes.

Even if such security interests are perfected, it may not be practicable for a holder of the notes to enforce or economically benefit from their rights with respect to such security interests.","Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can be properly perfected and its priority retained only through the taking of certain actions. The security interests of holders of the notes will not be perfected with respect to certain items of Collateral that cannot be perfected by the filing of financing statements or the filing of a notice of security interest with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the U.S. Copyright Office or subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, by delivery of any certificated equity or notes representing pledged Collateral to the Collateral Agent (or its bailee) together with any proper endorsements executed in blank or by delivery of control agreements with respect to certain deposit accounts and securities accounts (and our obligation to obtain such control agreements will discharge if we fail to deliver them after using commercially reasonable efforts). To the extent that the security interests in any portion of the Collateral are unperfected, the liens securing the 17 ----- notes and guarantees may be avoided in a bankruptcy and, if avoided, the rights of holders of the notes with respect to such Collateral will be equal to the rights of our general unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filed by or against us under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, the security interest of the Collateral Agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, we may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings for certain types of Collateral. If we fail to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders of the notes will not be entitled to realize on the Collateral or any recovery with respect to the Collateral. Furthermore, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Under the terms of the security documents related to the notes, we are also not required to obtain third party consents with respect to certain categories of Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor Collateral Agent has any obligation to obtain such consents or make any filings with respect to the Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest or lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Company and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the notes in specified Collateral. The Trustee and the Collateral Agent will not monitor the Collateral, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the lien on such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral, to monitor the perfection of any security interests therein or to make any filings or recordings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any of the security interests. Such failure to perfect the security interest may result in the loss of the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the notes against third parties. Even if the liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge or perfection of a lien on Collateral or future guarantee might be avoidable in bankruptcy or in a state law or other proceeding.” In addition, in certain jurisdictions, security interests created over particular assets can only be perfected by possession or “control” of the asset by the secured party. The terms of the security documents may not require possession or “control” be granted to the secured party, meaning that the security interest will remain unperfected until possession or “control” is granted.",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Rights of holders of the notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain Collateral.

To the extent that the security interests in any portion of the Collateral are unperfected, the liens securing the 17 ----- notes and guarantees may be avoided in a bankruptcy and, if avoided, the rights of holders of the notes with respect to such Collateral will be equal to the rights of our general unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy filed by or against us under applicable U.S. federal bankruptcy laws. In addition, the security interest of the Collateral Agent will be subject to practical challenges generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, we may need to obtain the consent of third parties and make additional filings for certain types of Collateral. If we fail to obtain these consents or make these filings, the security interests may be invalid and the holders of the notes will not be entitled to realize on the Collateral or any recovery with respect to the Collateral. Furthermore, the consents of any third parties may not be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such Collateral. Accordingly, the Collateral Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. Under the terms of the security documents related to the notes, we are also not required to obtain third party consents with respect to certain categories of Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor Collateral Agent has any obligation to obtain such consents or make any filings with respect to the Collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest or lien can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Company and the guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the notes in specified Collateral. The Trustee and the Collateral Agent will not monitor the Collateral, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the lien on such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral, to monitor the perfection of any security interests therein or to make any filings or recordings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any of the security interests. Such failure to perfect the security interest may result in the loss of the practical benefits of the liens thereon or of the priority of the liens securing the notes against third parties. Even if the liens on Collateral acquired or arising in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See \u201c\u2014Any future pledge or perfection of a lien on Collateral or future guarantee might be avoidable in bankruptcy or in a state law or other proceeding.\u201d In addition, in certain jurisdictions, security interests created over particular assets can only be perfected by possession or \u201ccontrol\u201d of the asset by the secured party.

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to an Investment in the Notes,13.1.18,Rights of holders of the notes would generally be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.,"If a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us, the ability of holders of the notes to collect on the notes would generally be significantly impaired. A bankruptcy case may be commenced by us or by certain unsecured or undersecured creditors as provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The right of the Collateral Agent (and as to the extent permitted under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) to repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired (and at a minimum likely delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to, or possibly even after, the Collateral Agent for the notes has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the “automatic stay” prohibits a secured creditor, such as the Collateral Agent for the notes, from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may be denied under the particular facts and circumstances). Moreover, applicable bankruptcy law and/or the bankruptcy court generally permit the debtor to continue to retain and to use Collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the Collateral, even if the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” is undefined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and may vary according to circumstances (and is within discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is generally intended to protect the value of a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral from diminution as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case and may include periodic cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security of such type, at such times, and in such amount if and as the court in its discretion, may determine, for any diminution in the value of such creditor’s collateral as a result of the automatic stay or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy court has broad discretionary powers in all these matters, including the valuation of the collateral and the nature, accessibility or value of any other Collateral that may be substituted for it. A bankruptcy court could conclude that a secured creditor’s interest in its collateral is “adequately protected” against any diminution in value during the bankruptcy case without the need of providing any additional protection, and, among other things, a bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent for the notes could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter, or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the holders of the notes would be “undersecured.” Federal bankruptcy laws generally do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and fees during a debtor’s bankruptcy case to a creditor holding “undersecured” claims; nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, the following factors, among others, might bear on recoveries by holders of the notes: - a debtor in a bankruptcy case does not have the ability to compel performance of a “financial accommodation,” including the funding of any undrawn loans that might be contemplated to fund operations; - the bankruptcy court may approve debtor-in-possession financing that may be required to be repaid before secured and other creditors are paid or that may be secured by liens on the Collateral that are granted a higher priority than those liens securing the notes; - lenders with higher priority liens or other secured creditors may seek, and perhaps receive, relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on their respective liens; and 19 ----- - the cost, delay, and procedures of bankruptcy, including potentially pursuing a reorganization plan, could affect operations, revenues, and the value available for creditors. Moreover, in a bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court would have broad discretion to approve transactions (such as those outside of the ordinary course of business) and otherwise take actions that could disadvantage the holders of the notes. Among other things, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case would require prior permission from the bankruptcy court (which may be denied under the particular facts and circumstances). Accordingly, there can be no assurances, pending or following the completion of such a proceeding, with respect to the following, among other things: whether and when any payments under the notes would be made (or the length of the delay in making any such payments); whether the terms and conditions of the notes or any rights of the holders of the notes would be altered or ignored without the consent of holders of notes (including potentially under a plan of reorganization which, under certain circumstances as set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, may be confirmed over the dissent of the holders of the notes); whether holders of the notes would be able to enforce their rights against the guarantors under their guarantees; and whether and to what extent holders of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or receive any payment at all. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a bankruptcy court could order substantive consolidation of the Company or a guarantor with one or more of their affiliates or subsidiaries (even those that themselves are not then a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). We believe that the Company and the guarantors have observed and will observe certain formalities and operating procedures that are generally recognized requirements for maintaining their respective separate existences, and that their respective assets and liabilities can be readily identified as distinct from each other’s and from those of their affiliates and subsidiaries. We cannot assure holders of the notes, however, that a bankruptcy court would agree. If a bankruptcy court concludes that substantive consolidation of the Company or a guarantor with any affiliate or subsidiary is warranted, holders of the notes should expect that any payments on account of their claims may be delayed and/or reduced and that the creditors of such other consolidated entities would assert a claim with respect to the Collateral. Also, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the notes will be subject to various restrictions with respect to their ability to object to certain matters or to take other actions following the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to the Collateral prior to the discharge of the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement (including with respect to our use of cash collateral or obtaining debtor-inpossession financing secured by the Collateral that satisfy certain express condition).",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Rights of holders of the notes would generally be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.\nText: If a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us, the ability of holders of the notes to collect on the notes would generally be significantly impaired.

The bankruptcy court has broad discretionary powers in all these matters, including the valuation of the collateral and the nature, accessibility or value of any other Collateral that may be substituted for it. A bankruptcy court could conclude that a secured creditor\u2019s interest in its collateral is \u201cadequately protected\u201d against any diminution in value during the bankruptcy case without the need of providing any additional protection, and, among other things, a bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the term \u201cadequate protection,\u201d it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Collateral Agent for the notes could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter, or whether or to what extent holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment of loss of value of the Collateral through the requirement of \u201cadequate protection\u201d or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes (after taking into account all other obligations secured thereby on a pari passu basis), the holders of the notes would be \u201cundersecured.\u201d Federal bankruptcy laws generally do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs and fees during a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy case to a creditor holding \u201cundersecured\u201d claims; nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. In the event of a bankruptcy proceeding, the following factors, among others, might bear on recoveries by holders of the notes: - a debtor in a bankruptcy case does not have the ability to compel performance of a \u201cfinancial accommodation,\u201d including the funding of any undrawn loans that might be contemplated to fund operations; - the bankruptcy court may approve debtor-in-possession financing that may be required to be repaid before secured and other creditors are paid or that may be secured by liens on the Collateral that are granted a higher priority than those liens securing the notes; - lenders with higher priority liens or other secured creditors may seek, and perhaps receive, relief from the automatic stay to foreclose on their respective liens; and 19 ----- - the cost, delay, and procedures of bankruptcy, including potentially pursuing a reorganization plan, could affect operations, revenues, and the value available for creditors. Moreover, in a bankruptcy proceeding, the bankruptcy court would have broad discretion to approve transactions (such as those outside of the ordinary course of business) and otherwise take actions that could disadvantage the holders of the notes. Among other things, any disposition of the Collateral during a bankruptcy case would require prior permission from the bankruptcy court (which may be denied under the particular facts and circumstances). Accordingly, there can be no assurances, pending or following the completion of such a proceeding, with respect to the following, among other things: whether and when any payments under the notes would be made (or the length of the delay in making any such payments); whether the terms and conditions of the notes or any rights of the holders of the notes would be altered or ignored without the consent of holders of notes (including potentially under a plan of reorganization which, under certain circumstances as set forth in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, may be confirmed over the dissent of the holders of the notes); whether holders of the notes would be able to enforce their rights against the guarantors under their guarantees; and whether and to what extent holders of notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or receive any payment at all. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, a bankruptcy court could order substantive consolidation of the Company or a guarantor with one or more of their affiliates or subsidiaries (even those that themselves are not then a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code). We believe that the Company and the guarantors have observed and will observe certain formalities and operating procedures that are generally recognized requirements for maintaining their respective separate existences, and that their respective assets and liabilities can be readily identified as distinct from each other\u2019s and from those of their affiliates and subsidiaries. We cannot assure holders of the notes, however, that a bankruptcy court would agree. If a bankruptcy court concludes that substantive consolidation of the Company or a guarantor with any affiliate or subsidiary is warranted, holders of the notes should expect that any payments on account of their claims may be delayed and/or reduced and that the creditors of such other consolidated entities would assert a claim with respect to the Collateral. Also, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the notes will be subject to various restrictions with respect to their ability to object to certain matters or to take other actions following the filing of a bankruptcy petition with respect to the Collateral prior to the discharge of the obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement (including with respect to our use of cash collateral or obtaining debtor-inpossession financing secured by the Collateral that satisfy certain express condition).\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the industry is susceptible to rapid technological advances or innovations?\nTitle: Rights of holders of the notes would generally be adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings.\nText: If a bankruptcy case were to be commenced by or against us, the ability of holders of the notes to collect on the notes would generally be significantly impaired. A bankruptcy case may be commenced by us or by certain unsecured or undersecured creditors as provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The right of the Collateral Agent (and as to the extent permitted under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) to repossess and dispose of the Collateral securing the notes upon acceleration is likely to be significantly impaired (and at a minimum likely delayed) by federal bankruptcy law if bankruptcy proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to, or possibly even after, the Collateral Agent for the notes has repossessed and disposed of the Collateral.

The principal and interest payment obligations on such debt may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our long-term obligations.,"As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we and the guarantors would have had approximately $6.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (excluding intercompany debt and before deducting deferred financing costs), all of which would have constituted senior debt (including the notes), and of which approximately $3.3 billion (including the notes), and an additional $580 million undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit), would have been secured by substantially all of the assets of us and the guarantors. Our substantial debt may have important consequences to you. For instance, it could: - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt, which would reduce funds available for other business purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that may have less debt and better access to capital resources; - limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; and - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including those relating to the notes. Our ability to service our significant financial obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow. This is partially subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.

As of March 31, 2024, on an as adjusted basis for the Refinancing, our maximum available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility would have been $580 million (excluding approximately $6 million of outstanding letters of credit). If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the notes and the guarantees thereof, the holders of that indebtedness will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of the Company. Further, subject to the restrictions in the Credit Agreement that governs the Senior Credit Agreement and the indenture, we also will have the ability to incur additional senior 21 ----- secured indebtedness, which may also be guaranteed by the guarantors and may be secured by a first-priority senior secured lien on the Collateral ranking equally with the lien securing the notes and the guarantees.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business,13.3.1,"The success of our business is dependent upon advertising revenues, which are seasonal and cyclical, and also fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.","Our main source of revenue is the sale of advertising time and space. Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things: - economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole; - the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations; - changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located; - local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising; - our competitors’ activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies; - the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason; - decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason; - the competitiveness of local, regional, and federal elections and ballot initiatives; - labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and - other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers’ increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 2% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected. Also, our stations affiliated with the NBC Network broadcast Olympic Games and typically experience increased viewership and revenue during those broadcasts. As a result of the seasonality and cyclicality of our revenue and broadcast operating income, and the historically significant increase in our revenue and broadcast operating income during even-numbered years, it has been, and is expected to remain, difficult to engage in period-over-period comparisons of our revenue and results of operations.",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations.

Our ability to sell advertising time and space depends on, among other things: - economic conditions in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole; - the popularity of the programming offered by our television stations; - changes in the population demographics in the areas where our stations are located; - local and national advertising price fluctuations, which can be affected by the availability of programming, the popularity of programming, and the relative supply of and demand for commercial advertising; - our competitors\u2019 activities, including increased competition from other advertising-based mediums, particularly digital platforms, cable networks, MVPDs and other internet companies; - the duration and extent of any network preemption of regularly scheduled programming for any reason; - decisions by advertisers to withdraw or delay planned advertising expenditures for any reason; - the competitiveness of local, regional, and federal elections and ballot initiatives; - labor disputes or other disruptions at major national advertisers, programming providers or networks; and - other factors beyond our control. Our results are also subject to seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. Seasonal fluctuations typically result in higher revenue and broadcast operating income in the second and fourth quarters rather than in the first and third quarters of each year. This seasonality is primarily attributable to advertisers\u2019 increased expenditures in the spring and in anticipation of holiday season spending in the fourth quarter and an increase in television viewership during these periods. In addition, we typically experience fluctuations in our revenue and broadcast operating income between even-numbered and odd-numbered years. In years in which there are impending elections for various state and national offices, which primarily occur in even-numbered years, political advertising revenue tends to increase, often significantly, and particularly during presidential election years. We consider political broadcast advertising revenue to be revenue earned from the sale of advertising to political candidates, political parties and special interest groups of advertisements broadcast by our stations that contain messages primarily focused on elections and/or public policy issues. In even-numbered years, we typically derive a material portion of our broadcast advertising revenue from political broadcast advertisers. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 2% and 14%, respectively, of our total revenue from political broadcast advertisers. If political broadcast advertising revenues declined, especially in an even-numbered year, our results of operations and financial condition could also be materially adversely affected.

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Related to Our Business,13.3.7,"We are highly dependent upon our network affiliations, and our business and results of operations may be materially affected if a network (i) terminates its affiliation with us, (ii) significantly changes the economic terms and conditions of any future affiliation agreements with us or (iii) significantly changes the type, quality or quantity of programming provided to us under an affiliation agreement.","Our business depends in large part on the success of our network affiliations. One or more stations in each of our operating markets are affiliated with at least one of the four major broadcast networks pursuant to individual affiliation agreements. Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the affiliated network during the term of the related agreement. Our affiliation agreements generally expire at various dates between year-end 2024 and January 1, 2026 (with respect to Big Four networks). See “Business — Markets and Stations” incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum for additional information on all of our affiliation agreements and their respective expiration dates. If we cannot enter into affiliation agreements to replace any agreements in advance of their expiration, we would no longer be able to carry the affiliated network’s programming. This loss of programming would require us to create and/or obtain replacement programming. Such replacement programming may involve higher costs and may not be as attractive to our target audiences, thereby reducing our ability to generate advertising revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. On the other hand, replacement programming may provide additional advertising inventory than that provided to affiliated stations by their networks. Our concentration of CBS and/or NBC affiliates makes us particularly sensitive to adverse changes in our business relationship with, and the general success of, CBS and/or NBC. If we are able to renew or replace existing affiliation agreements, we can give no assurance that any future affiliation agreements will have economic terms or conditions equivalent to or more advantageous to us than our current agreements. If in the future a network or networks impose more adverse economic terms upon us, such event or events could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. 25 ----- The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the “sweeps prohibition,” which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during “sweeps” ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC’s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain online video distributors (“OVDs”) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the “TVPA of 2019”). Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a “short market” (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming.

The failure to renegotiate such agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our ability to successfully negotiate future retransmission consent agreements may be hindered by potential legislative or regulatory changes to the framework under which these agreements are negotiated. 25 ----- The FCC has taken actions to implement various provisions of the STELAR Reauthorization Act of 2014 affecting the carriage of television stations, including (i) adopting rules that allow for the modification of satellite television markets in order to ensure that satellite operators carry the broadcast stations of most interest to their communities; (ii) tightening its rules on joint retransmission consent negotiations to prohibit joint negotiations by stations in the same market unless those stations are commonly controlled; (iii) prohibiting a television station from limiting the ability of an MVPD to carry into its local market television signals that are deemed significantly viewed; and (iv) eliminating the \u201csweeps prohibition,\u201d which had precluded cable operators from deleting or repositioning local commercial television stations during \u201csweeps\u201d ratings periods. We currently are not a party to any agreements that delegate our authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any of our television stations or grant us authority to negotiate retransmission consent for any other television station. Nevertheless, we cannot predict how the FCC\u2019s restrictions on joint negotiations might impact future opportunities. The FCC also has sought comment on whether it should modify or eliminate the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. We cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. If, however, the FCC eliminates or relaxes its rules enforcing our program exclusivity rights, it could affect our ability to negotiate future retransmission consent agreements, and it could harm our ratings and advertising revenue if cable and satellite operators import duplicative programming. In addition, certain online video distributors (\u201cOVDs\u201d) have explored streaming broadcast programming over the internet without approval from or payments to the broadcaster. The majority of federal courts have issued preliminary injunctions enjoining these OVDs from streaming broadcast programming. Separately, on December 19, 2014, the FCC issued an NPRM proposing to classify certain OVDs as MVPDs for purposes of certain FCC carriage rules. If the FCC adopts its proposal, OVDs would need to negotiate for consent from broadcasters before they retransmit broadcast signals. We cannot predict whether the FCC will adopt its proposal or other modified rules that might weaken our rights to negotiate with OVDs. In December 2019, Congress adopted the Satellite Television Community Protection and Promotion Act of 2019 and the Television Viewer Protection Act of 2019 (the \u201cTVPA of 2019\u201d). Among other things, these acts (i) made permanent the copyright license set out in Section 119 of the Copyright Act; (ii) limited eligibility for use of the Section 119 license to retransmit the signals of network television broadcast stations to unserved households to those satellite operators who provide local-into-local service to all DMAs; and (iii) modified the definition of unserved households to those households located in a \u201cshort market\u201d (which, in turn, was defined as a local market in which programming of one or more of the top four networks is not offered on either the primary or multicast stream by any network station in that market). The TVPA of 2019 also made permanent the requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate in good faith and adds a provision that will (i) allow MVPDs to designate a buying group to negotiate retransmission consent agreements on their behalf and (ii) require large stations groups, including ours, to negotiate in good faith with a qualified MVPD buying group. Congress continues to consider various changes to the statutory scheme governing retransmission of broadcast programming. Some of the proposed bills would make it more difficult to negotiate retransmission consent agreements with large MVPDs and would weaken our leverage to seek market-based compensation for our programming. We cannot predict whether any of these proposals will become law, and, if any do, we cannot determine the effect that any statutory changes would have on our business.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

In December 2023, the FCC adopted two modifications to the top-four prohibition that make it more restrictive. These rule changes took effect in March 2024. First, the FCC extended the top-four prohibition to low power television (“LPTV”) stations and multicast streams. As a result of this change, a licensee will be prohibited from acquiring network-affiliated programming of another top-four station in a DMA and then placing that programming on either the multicast stream of a full-power station or a LPTV station in a DMA in which it already owns another top-four rated station. These additional restrictions will apply to transactions entered into after December 26, 2023. Existing combinations will be grandfathered, but may not be transferred or assigned except in compliance with the new rule, or a waiver of the new rule. Second, the FCC modified its methodology for determining a station’s audience share for purposes of the top-four prohibition (and failing station waiver requests) to (i) consider audience share data over a 12-month period immediately preceding the date the application is filed, (ii) expanding the relevant daypart for audience share data significantly, and (iii) requiring the inclusion of audience share data for all free-to-consumer, non-simulcast multicast streams. In November 2022, the FCC issued a Forfeiture Order finding that Gray’s acquisition of CBS programming from another broadcaster in the Anchorage market for Gray’s station KYES-TV was inconsistent with the local television ownership rule’s “topfour” prohibition given Gray’s ownership of KTUU-TV in the same market (a top-four ranked station) and imposed a fine of $518,283. Gray has brought a judicial challenge to the FCC’s Order, which remains pending. The FCC also considers television Local Marketing Agreements (“LMAs”) (which are agreements under which a television station sells or provides more than 15% of the programming on another same-market television station) as “attributable interests.” Pursuant to the FCC’s ownership rules currently in effect, our ability to expand in our present markets through additional station acquisitions or LMAs may be constrained.",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""The text focuses on FCC duopoly restrictions and ownership rules for television stations, without mentioning cyclical products or associated risks.\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""The text focuses on FCC duopoly restrictions and ownership rules for television stations, without mentioning cyclical products or associated risks.""}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": ""The text focuses on FCC duopoly restrictions and ownership rules for television stations, without mentioning cyclical products or associated risks."", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: The FCC\u2019s duopoly restrictions limit our ability to own and operate multiple television stations in the same market.\nText: The FCC\u2019s ownership rules generally prohibit us from acquiring an \u201cattributable interest\u201d in two television stations that are located in the same market unless at least one of the stations is not ranked among the top-four stations in the market (the \u201ctop-four\u201d prohibition).

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.5,Subsidiary Guarantees,59.5.1,Guarantees”) by the Subsidiary Guarantors.,"The obligations of a Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount as will result in the obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee not to be deemed to constitute a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under federal or state law. This provision may not be effective to protect the Subsidiary Guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may eliminate a Subsidiary Guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively limits the value of a Subsidiary Guarantee or effectively makes such Subsidiary Guarantee worthless. The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be unconditional and absolute, irrespective of any invalidity, illegality, unenforceability of any Note or the Indenture or any extension, compromise, waiver or release in respect of any obligation of the Company or any other Subsidiary Guarantor under any Note or the Indenture, or any modification or amendment of or supplement to the Indenture. As of the Issue Date, it is expected that all of the Company’s Subsidiaries other than subsidiaries which we have designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” and it is expected that all of our Restricted Subsidiaries will be Subsidiary Guarantors on the Issue Date. However, under the circumstances described below under the subheading “— Certain Covenants — Limitation on Creation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” any of our other Subsidiaries may also be designated as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. Claims of creditors of Unrestricted Subsidiaries and other non-guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, and claims of preferred stockholders (other than the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors) of those subsidiaries will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the Subsidiary 37 ----- Guarantors, including Holders of the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary, unless such Subsidiary Guarantor is also released from its obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall not be released from its obligations under the Notes unless (i) the transaction or transactions that caused such Subsidiary Guarantor to cease to be a Subsidiary are entered into for a bona fide business purpose (as determined in good faith by the Company) and, for the avoidance of doubt, not for the primary purpose of causing such release, (ii) the portion of Equity Interests that caused such Subsidiary Guarantor to cease to be a Subsidiary were not transferred to an Affiliate of the Company (other than for purposes of a bona fide joint venture arrangement on terms that are not less favorable than arm\u2019s-length terms, as determined in good faith by the Company) and (iii) after giving pro forma effect to the applicable release, in the event the Company continues to retain an ownership interest in such Subsidiary Guarantor, the Company is deemed to have made a new Investment in such Person on the date of such release (as if such Person were not a Subsidiary Guarantor) in an amount equal to the portion of the fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Company) of the Company\u2019s retained ownership interest in such Person and such Investment is permitted hereunder. 38 ----- For all purposes under the Indenture, in connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction\u2019s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.6,Collateral and Security,59.6.1,First Lien Intercreditor Agreement,"The Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Credit Agreement Agent, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders of the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Senior Credit Agreement. All references to the First Lien Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to such First Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Applicable Authorized Representative” will have the right to act or refrain from acting or, if applicable, instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent and will remain the Credit Agreement Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of the Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the “Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date”). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be (1) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral and (2) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). The “Controlling Collateral Agent” means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, until the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the Credit Agreement Agent and from and after the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the collateral agent for the then Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the then Applicable Authorized Representative). Accordingly, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any other intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). At any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, no other First Lien Secured Party shall or shall instruct any Authorized Representative to, and no 39 ----- Authorized Representative that is not the Controlling Collateral Agent shall, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Credit Agreement Agent (or a Person authorized by it), acting in accordance with the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral at such time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding that has been commenced by or against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties; provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, the date that is 150 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 150-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable series of First Lien Obligations) and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in any Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative if it is not the Credit Agreement Agent) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in respect of any Shared Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or a Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to such Shared Collateral or cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any case or proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, allowability, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default under any document governing a series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment 40 ----- pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such payment or distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the collateral agents of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as collateral agent) and any administrative agent or trustee of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as such); provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing such First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of First Lien Obligations and (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the security documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other case or proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, if such First Lien Secured Party is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, such First Lien Secured Party may not seek (and will waive any right to) to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any document governing its First Lien Obligations or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) each of the Liens in favor of any other First Lien Secured Party (including each other collateral agent) for the benefit of each series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged if, as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be allocated and applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP 41 -----",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: First Lien Intercreditor Agreement\nText: The Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Credit Agreement Agent, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders of the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Senior Credit Agreement. All references to the First Lien Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to such First Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative\u201d will have the right to act or refrain from acting or, if applicable, instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral.

Accordingly, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any other intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral).

Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the security documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other case or proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, if such First Lien Secured Party is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, such First Lien Secured Party may not seek (and will waive any right to) to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any document governing its First Lien Obligations or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) each of the Liens in favor of any other First Lien Secured Party (including each other collateral agent) for the benefit of each series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged if, as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be allocated and applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (\u201cDIP 41 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that market pricing for the company's products or services is irrational or not based on fundamental factors?\nTitle: First Lien Intercreditor Agreement\nText: The Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the Credit Agreement Agent, the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors will enter into the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral, which may be amended from time to time without the consent of the Holders of the Notes to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the Senior Credit Agreement. All references to the First Lien Obligations in this section of the Description of Notes shall refer only to such First Lien Obligations subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative\u201d will have the right to act or refrain from acting or, if applicable, instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. The Applicable Authorized Representative will initially be the Credit Agreement Agent and will remain the Credit Agreement Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of the Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date (as defined below) (such earlier date, the \u201cApplicable Authorized Representative Change Date\u201d). After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be (1) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral and (2) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the \u201cMajor Non-Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d). The \u201cControlling Collateral Agent\u201d means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, until the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the Credit Agreement Agent and from and after the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the collateral agent for the then Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the then Applicable Authorized Representative). Accordingly, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any other intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). At any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, no other First Lien Secured Party shall or shall instruct any Authorized Representative to, and no 39 ----- Authorized Representative that is not the Controlling Collateral Agent shall, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Credit Agreement Agent (or a Person authorized by it), acting in accordance with the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral at such time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding that has been commenced by or against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties; provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date\u201d means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, the date that is 150 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 150-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable series of First Lien Obligations) and (b) each Collateral Agent\u2019s and each other Authorized Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in any Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative if it is not the Credit Agreement Agent) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in respect of any Shared Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or a Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to such Shared Collateral or cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any case or proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, allowability, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default under any document governing a series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment 40 ----- pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such payment or distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the collateral agents of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as collateral agent) and any administrative agent or trustee of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as such); provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing such First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of First Lien Obligations and (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, an \u201cImpairment\u201d of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the security documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other case or proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, if such First Lien Secured Party is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, such First Lien Secured Party may not seek (and will waive any right to) to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any document governing its First Lien Obligations or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) each of the Liens in favor of any other First Lien Secured Party (including each other collateral agent) for the benefit of each series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged if, as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be allocated and applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.

After the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date, the Applicable Authorized Representative will be (1) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (other than the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral and (2) at any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Authorized Representative of the series of First Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding series of First Lien Obligations (including the Credit Agreement Obligations) with respect to such Shared Collateral (the \u201cMajor Non-Controlling Authorized Representative\u201d). The \u201cControlling Collateral Agent\u201d means, with respect to any Shared Collateral, until the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the Credit Agreement Agent and from and after the Applicable Authorized Representative Change Date with respect to such Shared Collateral, the collateral agent for the then Controlling Secured Parties (acting on the instructions of the then Applicable Authorized Representative). Accordingly, neither the Trustee nor the Collateral Agent will have rights to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Shared Collateral unless and until the Trustee becomes the Applicable Authorized Representative and the Collateral Agent becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. Only the Controlling Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any other intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral). At any time when the Credit Agreement Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, no other First Lien Secured Party shall or shall instruct any Authorized Representative to, and no 39 ----- Authorized Representative that is not the Controlling Collateral Agent shall, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral (including with respect to any intercreditor agreement with respect to any Shared Collateral), whether under applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that only the Credit Agreement Agent (or a Person authorized by it), acting in accordance with the Credit Agreement Collateral Documents, shall be entitled to take any such actions or exercise any such remedies with respect to Shared Collateral at such time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding that has been commenced by or against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the First Lien Obligations owed to such First Lien Secured Parties; (ii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such First Lien Secured Parties; provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) any Collateral Agent (as defined in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) or any other First Lien Secured Party may (but shall not be obligated to) file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such First Lien Secured Party, including any claims secured by the Shared Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The \u201cNon-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date\u201d means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, the date that is 150 consecutive days (throughout which consecutive 150-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable series of First Lien Obligations) and (b) each Collateral Agent\u2019s and each other Authorized Representative\u2019s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an event of default (as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations) has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the First Lien Obligations of that series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that series of First Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Shared Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all or a material portion of the Shared Collateral or (2) at any time the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor that has granted a security interest in any Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. If the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party exercises any rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph and thereafter the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Party commences (or attempts to commence) the exercise of any of its rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral (including seeking relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date shall be deemed not to have occurred and the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or any other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall stop exercising any such rights or remedies with respect to the Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent with respect thereto (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Authorized Representative if it is not the Credit Agreement Agent) may deal with such Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party in respect of any Shared Collateral will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Applicable Authorized Representative or a Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to such Shared Collateral or cause the Controlling Collateral Agent to do so. Each of the First Lien Secured Parties also will agree that it will not (and will waive any right to) question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any case or proceeding (including any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding), the perfection, allowability, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien Secured Parties in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If an event of default under any document governing a series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Shared Collateral in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment 40 ----- pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral by the Controlling Collateral Agent or received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such payment or distribution (subject, in the case of any such proceeds, payment or distribution, to the sentence immediately following) shall be applied among the First Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to the collateral agents of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as collateral agent) and any administrative agent or trustee of each series of First Lien Obligations (in its capacity as such); provided that following the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding with respect to the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor, solely for the purpose of this paragraph in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing such First Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Bankruptcy Law in such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding. It is the intention of the First Lien Secured Parties of each series that the holders of First Lien Obligations of such series (and not the First Lien Secured Parties of any other series) bear the risk of (i) any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations), (y) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other series of First Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of First Lien Obligations and (ii) the existence of any Collateral for any other series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral for such series (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, an \u201cImpairment\u201d of such series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such series of First Lien Obligations permitted by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such First Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the First Lien Obligations of any series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of any other applicable Bankruptcy Law), any reference to such First Lien Obligations or the security documents governing such First Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the First Lien Secured Parties may institute any suit or assert in any suit, Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or other case or proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Secured Party seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral. In addition, if such First Lien Secured Party is not the Controlling Collateral Agent, such First Lien Secured Party may not seek (and will waive any right to) to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Shared Collateral. If any First Lien Secured Party obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any document governing its First Lien Obligations or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each series of First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) each of the Liens in favor of any other First Lien Secured Party (including each other collateral agent) for the benefit of each series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged if, as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom will be allocated and applied as described in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor becomes subject to a case under the Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (\u201cDIP 41 -----\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

The relative rights in the Collateral among the Holders of the Notes, the holders of the Credit Agreement Obligations and holders of any other First Lien Obligations will be governed by the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The other Persons holding First Lien Obligations may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the Holders of the Notes. The Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors are able to incur additional Indebtedness in the future that could be secured by Liens on the Collateral, including additional First Lien Obligations. The amount of such additional First Lien Obligations and additional Indebtedness is limited by the covenants described under \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014 Limitation on Liens\u201d and \u201c\u2014Certain Covenants\u2014Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.\u201d Under certain circumstances, the amount of such additional First Lien Obligations and additional Indebtedness could be significant. The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, other than the Excluded Assets, real property assets (unless subject after the Issue Date to a mortgage securing the Senior Credit Agreement) and other than any assets released from the Collateral as described below under the caption \u201c\u2014 Release of Liens on Collateral\u201d.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

The paying agent shall promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment an amount equal to the purchase price for such Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Change of Control Purchase Date, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver to such Holder of Notes accepted for payment in part a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes, and any Note not accepted for payment in whole or in part for any reason consistent with the Indenture shall be promptly returned to the Holder of such Note. On and after a Change of Control Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price therefor. We will announce the results of the Change of Control Offer to Holders of the Notes on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Purchase Date. We will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and all other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with any Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision will not require us to make a Change of Control Offer upon the consummation of certain transactions involving Permitted Holders. See “— Certain Definitions — Change of Control” and “— _Certain Definitions — Permitted Holders.” As a result of the definition of “Permitted Holders,” a concentration of control in the hands_ of Permitted Holders would not give rise to a situation where Holders would be entitled to have their Notes repurchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. As of March 8, 2024, collectively, the Howell-Robinson family beneficially owned approximately 46.1% of the Company’s outstanding Voting Stock. We will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by us and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described above under the caption “— Redemption” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Repurchase Event, contingent upon such Change of Control Repurchase Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. The Change of Control Repurchase Event provision and the other covenants that limit the ability of the Company to incur debt may not necessarily afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, such as a reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving the Company that may adversely affect Holders, because such transactions may not involve a concentration in voting power or beneficial ownership, or, if there were such a concentration, may not involve a concentration of the magnitude required under the definition of “Change of Control” and may not result in the occurrence of a Ratings Event. The Company may not have sufficient funds to repurchase all the Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event. In addition, even if it has sufficient funds, the Company may be prohibited from repurchasing the Notes under the terms of other agreements relating to the Company’s Indebtedness at the time, including any Senior Credit Facilities. The Change of Control Repurchase Event provisions described above may deter certain mergers, tender offers and other transactions involving the Company or its subsidiaries by increasing the capital required to effectuate such transactions. With respect to the sale of “substantially all” the assets of the Company, which would constitute a Change of Control for purposes of the Indenture, the meaning of the phrase “substantially all” varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject transaction, has no clearly established meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation.

In no event later than 20 Business Days after any date (an “Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date”) that the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $75.0 million (or such lesser amount as the Company shall determine), the Company shall commence an offer to purchase to all Holders of Notes (an “Asset Sale Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase and to all holders of other First Lien Obligations containing provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to asset sales, in each case, equal to the Excess Proceeds. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other First Lien Obligations tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and the Company or its agent shall select the other First Lien Obligations to be purchased on a pro rata basis, by lot or such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate or, in the event the Notes are in global form, as prescribed by DTC. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. To the extent that any Excess Proceeds remain after completion of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use the remaining amount for general corporate purposes and such amount shall no longer constitute Excess Proceeds. In connection with an Asset Sale Offer, the Company shall mail to each Holder of Notes at such Holder’s registered address or, if the Notes are in global form, delivered to DTC through customary procedures, a notice stating: (i) that an Asset Sale Offer Trigger Date has occurred and that the Company is offering to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds (and identifying other Indebtedness, if any, that is entitled to participate pro rata in the Asset Sale Offer), at an offer price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of 56 ----- purchase (the “Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date”), which shall be a Business Day, specified in such notice, that is not earlier than 30 days or later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, (ii) the amount of accrued and unpaid interest as of the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, (iii) that any Note not tendered will continue to accrue interest, (iv) that, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price for the Notes payable pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, any Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, (v) the procedures, consistent with the Indenture, to be followed by a Holder of Notes in order to accept an Asset Sale Offer or to withdraw such acceptance, and (vi) such other information as may be required by the Indenture and applicable laws and regulations. On the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, the Company will (i) accept for payment the maximum principal amount of Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer that can be purchased out of Excess Proceeds from such Asset Sale, (ii) deposit with the paying agent the aggregate purchase price of all Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment and any accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes as of the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee all Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer. If less than all Notes tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer are accepted for payment by the Company for any reason consistent with the Indenture, selection of the Notes to be purchased by the Company shall be in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed or, if the Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC if the Notes are represented by global notes); provided that Notes accepted for payment in part shall only be purchased in integral multiples of $1,000. The paying agent shall promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment an amount equal to the purchase price for such Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver to such Holder of Notes accepted for payment in part a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes, and any Note not accepted for payment in whole or in part shall be promptly returned to the Holder of such Note. On and after an Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment, unless the Company defaults in the payment of the purchase price therefor. The Company will announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer to Holders of the Notes on or as soon as practicable after the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date. The Company will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and all other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with any Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Senior Credit Agreement limits, and any future credit facilities may limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes, and also provides that certain asset sale events with respect to the Company would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions. In the event an Asset Sale generating Excess Proceeds occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Company’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under such other agreements.",,as_expected,2024,112,"{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the company is exposed to risks associated with cyclical products?\nTitle: Proceeds\u201d on the 366th day after such Asset Sale (or for the avoidance of doubt on the day after such shorter application or investment\nText: period as the Company in its sole election may determine); provided that in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment; provided, further, that if such commitment is later terminated or cancelled prior to the application of such Net Proceeds or such Net Proceeds are not so applied within such 180-day period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

The paying agent shall promptly deliver to each Holder of Notes or portions thereof accepted for payment an amount equal to the purchase price for such Notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and deliver to such Holder of Notes accepted for payment in part a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes, and any Note not accepted for payment in whole or in part shall be promptly returned to the Holder of such Note.

The Company will announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer to Holders of the Notes on or as soon as practicable after the Asset Sale Offer Purchase Date. The Company will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, and all other applicable securities laws and regulations in connection with any Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any applicable securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations under the Asset Sale Offer provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The Senior Credit Agreement limits, and any future credit facilities may limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes, and also provides that certain asset sale events with respect to the Company would constitute a default under the Senior Credit Agreement. Any future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Company becomes a party may contain similar restrictions and provisions. In the event an Asset Sale generating Excess Proceeds occurs at a time when the Company is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Company could seek the consent of its senior lenders to the purchase of Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such a consent or repay such borrowings, the Company will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes. In such case, the Company\u2019s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, constitute a default under such other agreements.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that market pricing for the company's products or services is irrational or not based on fundamental factors?\nTitle: Proceeds\u201d on the 366th day after such Asset Sale (or for the avoidance of doubt on the day after such shorter application or investment\nText: period as the Company in its sole election may determine); provided that in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 180 days of such commitment; provided, further, that if such commitment is later terminated or cancelled prior to the application of such Net Proceeds or such Net Proceeds are not so applied within such 180-day period, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

or (ix) so long as the Notes Security Documents have not otherwise been terminated in accordance with their terms or the Collateral as a whole of the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor has not otherwise been released from the Lien of the Notes Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, (a) default by the Company or any such Subsidiary Guarantor for 60 days after receipt of written notice given by the Trustee or Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes in the performance of any covenant under the Notes Security Documents which materially adversely effects the enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Lien on the Collateral securing the Obligations with respect to the Notes or which materially adversely affects the condition or value of the Collateral, in each case, taken as a whole, (b) repudiation or disaffirmation by the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor of any of its material obligations under the Notes Security Documents or (c) the determination in a judicial proceeding that all or any material portion of the Notes Security Documents, taken as a whole, are unenforceable or invalid, for any reason, against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to any material portion of the Collateral. However, a default under clause (iv) or (vi) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default. If any Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of the preceding paragraph with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. In the case of an Event of Default arising from the events specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of the preceding paragraph with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that constitutes a Significant Subsidiary or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary, the principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on all outstanding Notes shall ipso facto become immediately due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except (i) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (which may only be waived with the consent of each Holder of Notes affected), or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. Any notice of a Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification Covenant”). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. 62 ----- If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an officers’ certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture except (i) a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes (which may only be waived with the consent of each Holder of Notes affected), or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision which under the Indenture cannot be modified or amended without the consent of each Holder of Notes affected. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest. Any notice of a Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a \u201cNoteholder Direction\u201d) provided by any one or more Holders (other than a Regulated Bank) (each a \u201cDirecting Holder\u201d) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder delivered to the Company and the Trustee that such Holder is not (or, in the case such Holder is DTC or its nominee, that such Holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that are not) Net Short (a \u201cPosition Representation\u201d), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to the delivery of a notice of Default shall be deemed a continuing representation until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed, at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction, to covenant to provide the Company with such other information as the Company may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such Holder\u2019s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a \u201cVerification Covenant\u201d). In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee, and DTC shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. 62 ----- If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an officers\u2019 certificate stating that the Company has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company provides to the Trustee an officers\u2019 certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder\u2019s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing paragraphs shall not apply to any Holder that is a Regulated Bank. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Company is required, within 10 days of becoming aware of any Default which has not been timely cured or Event of Default, to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}","{""detection_step_attempt_count"": 1, ""detection_step_raw"": ""```json\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""\""\n}\n```"", ""detection_step_parsed"": {""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """"}, ""answer"": ""No"", ""evidence"": """", ""prompt_str"": ""\nQuestion: Does the text indicate that the industry is susceptible to rapid technological advances or innovations?\nTitle: nan\nText: The Indenture will provide that each of the following constitutes an Event of Default: (i) a default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on any Note;

999,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2656,BOOK ENTRY DELIVERY AND FORM,2656.1,The Global Notes,2656.1.1,,"We expect that pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture governing the notes. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with DTC’s procedures, in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes. Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the issuer, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest (including additional interest, if any) on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. 97 ----- Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security (as defined below), such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the Indenture. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Notice to Investors.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time.

DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture governing the notes, DTC will exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading \u201cNotice to Investors.\u201d DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a \u201cbanking organization\u201d within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \u201cclearing corporation\u201d within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a \u201cclearing agency\u201d registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants\u2019 accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. None of us, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

The initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the notes in the open market to cover syndicate short positions. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the notes. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the notes above independent market levels. The initial purchasers are not required to engage in these activities and may end these activities at any time. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, securities trading, hedging, brokerage activities, commercial lending and financial advisory services in the ordinary course of business to us, certain of our guarantors and certain of our affiliates, for which they receive customary fees and expenses reimbursement. Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may hold positions in the 2026 Notes that we intend to purchase in the Tender Offer with the net proceeds from this offering, and these entities would receive a portion of the net proceeds from this offering as tender offer consideration if they tender their 2026 Notes in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer. Truist Securities, Inc., BofA Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are the joint dealer managers under the Tender Offer and will receive customary expense reimbursement and indemnity in accordance therewith. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates are agents, arrangers and/or lenders under our Senior Credit Agreement. Each of the initial purchasers, either themselves or acting through their affiliates, will serve as arrangers, agents and/or lenders for the Third Amendment (including the 2024 Term Loan, increased revolving credit facility, and extended revolving credit facility thereunder). See \u201cDescription of Other Indebtedness.\u201d Certain of the initial purchasers (or their respective affiliates) may be lenders under the 2019 Term Loan and therefore would receive a portion of the proceeds of this offering. See \u201cUse of Proceeds.\u201d In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the initial purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. To the extent the initial purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain others of the initial purchasers may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the notes. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"
