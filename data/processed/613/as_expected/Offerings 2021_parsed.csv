613,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are a leading global manufacturer and distributor of engineered components critical to the safety and performance of a range of towable and related applications. We deliver exceptional products that our customers rely on. We strive to deliver superior quality, provide the highest level of customer service and offer our customers innovative solutions through customized products and technology. We offer a broad portfolio of axle assemblies, hydraulic components, chassis, aftermarket parts, and other related engineered products. Our manufactured products span over 65,000 SKUs and are sold under a number of well-known, market-leading brands, including our flagship Dexter and AL-KO brands. We offer over 30,000 additional SKUs throughout our distribution network. We serve over 40,000 customers globally. Our manufactured products are used in applications across a diverse set of end-use segments, including agriculture, commercial, construction, general industrial, livestock, landscaping, marine, military, energy, residential, recreational vehicle (“RV”), transportation and many other specialty end-use segments. The majority of our products are critical to the reliability, safety and performance of the end-products in which they are utilized. Given the high cost of downtime relative to the cost of our products, our customers and the ultimate end-users of our products place a premium on the superior performance and reliability our products deliver. Our two flagship brands, Dexter in North America and AL-KO in the rest of the world, account for the majority of our sales. Our other brands, including CM Trailers, Kodiak, Redline, Redneck, Rockwell American, Silent Drive, Aguti, Bankside Patterson, CBE, E&P Hydraulics, Nordelettronica, Safim, Sawiko, G&S Chassis and upon consummation of the acquisition of Brink International B.V., Brink, are also recognized for product quality, reliability, innovation and superior customer service. The foregoing attributes, combined with our ability to deliver customized products with short lead times, have created deep and long-standing relationships with our customers. Our customer base is primarily made up of relatively small companies that lack engineering expertise in our product categories, thus we enjoy an advantaged position within a highly fragmented industry. Our advanced engineering expertise and proximity to our customers deeply ingrain us into our customers’ product design, engineering and development processes, enhance our longterm customer retention and support premium pricing for our products. We operate our business on a regional basis through our two reportable segments, North America and Rest of World (“RoW”). Within the majority of the end-use segments in which we compete, we estimate our sales are approximately five times larger than that of our next largest North American competitor and approximately three times larger than that of our largest European competitor. In addition, we believe that we have the broadest geographic footprint of any single aftermarket distributor of light and medium duty components for towable applications in North America. In 2020, 89% of our net sales were in end-use segments where we believe we hold the number one or number two position, based on management’s extensive knowledge and expertise in the industry. We believe that we are the primary axle provider to approximately two-thirds of our customers in North America and we are larger than the majority of our suppliers. Based on management’s knowledge of the industry, we believe that our scale, combined with our vertically integrated hub-and-spoke manufacturing and broad distribution network, enables us to respond to customer requests with premium quality customized product solutions, on shorter delivery lead times than many of our competitors and at an attractive cost position. 1 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

(2) Industrial & Utility includes Agriculture, Commercial, Construction, Do-it-yourself (“DIY”), Energy, Transportation, Military and Specialty Heavy Duty. In January 2021, we acquired Redneck Inc. and Redline Products LLC (together, “Redneck”), a leading distributor of trailer components in North America. Together with our Rockwell American distribution business, this acquisition creates what we believe to be the broadest geographic footprint of any single aftermarket distributor of light and medium duty components for towable applications in North America, provides us with unique insights into end-consumer behavior and preferences, and increases our aftermarket net sales. Our strong brand reputation and growing installed base allow us to capture high margin aftermarket business. In 2020, aftermarket net sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales would have increased from 15% to approximately 20% if Redneck sales were included. In July 2021, we reached an agreement to acquire the European towbar solutions specialist Brink International B.V., which expands our portfolio into the area of engineered towing and carrying solutions. Brink enjoys a global manufacturing footprint and long-term exclusive relationships with major OEs, with a strong focus on performance, safety standards, availability and innovation. Approximately 73% of Brink’s 2020 net sales are from retrofit and 27% from line fit. Brink’s difficult to replicate product offerings and large SKU availability drives its leading position in the aftermarket. We believe compelling underlying trends will support future growth with increasing Brink towbar take rates, growing share of SUVs, increased consumer interest in towing products and low towbar share penetration of existing vehicles. We have consistently delivered strong financial and operating results. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated net sales of $1,534.0 million and $1,506.6 million, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $268.5 million and $247.0 million, respectively. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2021, we generated net sales of $2,252.0 million and Leverageable EBITDA of $380.2 million, pro forma for the acquisition of Brink. 2 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

DexKo Global Inc. (“DexKo Global”) was formed at the end of 2015 through the combination of two industryleading businesses, Dexter Axle in North America and AL-KO in RoW. Dexter Axle was founded in Elkhart, Indiana by Leonard Dexter in 1960. The product offering was initially limited to manufactured housing and RV axles, but over time, Dexter Axle expanded its portfolio. Dexter Axle underwent a number of ownership changes: it was acquired by Philips Industries, Inc. in 1966, which was later acquired by Tomkins plc, a broad, industrial conglomerate in 1990, and was sold to The Sterling Group, L.P. (“Sterling”) in 2012. AL-KO was founded in Kötz, Germany in 1931 by Alois Kober and grew to become the leading European designer and manufacturer of trailer axles, trailer components, chassis and motorized chassis. In 1988, AL-KO expanded into Australia through the acquisition of Girlock Caravan and Trailer Parts. 3 ----- From 2012 to 2017, Dexter Axle grew its market share by introducing new product lines, entering new enduse segments and executing eight strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition of AL-KO at the end of 2015. In 2015, DexKo established the DexKo Operating System to drive operational improvements, and since then, increased axle production per square foot of manufacturing space by over 25% in the Dexter Axle business. Since 2015, DexKo’s product offering has become significantly more diversified and we have become a true global leader in towable and related applications with a presence across six continents. In July 2017, we were acquired by KPS Capital Partners, LP. Beyond strategic M&A, we have continued to implement the DexKo Operating System and have upgraded key personnel across operations, finance, sales, technology, innovation and M&A. We have focused on continuous improvement initiatives such as labor productivity, SG&A optimization, strategic sourcing and facility consolidations, as well as strategic commercial actions. As a result of these initiatives, we increased our Adjusted EBITDA every year since 2018, despite the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy in 2020. Our leadership team that has supported this transformation is led by Fred Bentley, President and Chief Executive Officer, Matthew W. Hughes, Chief Financial Officer and William Meador II, Chief Operating Officer. All three individuals have long tenures at industry-leading firms, averaging over 25 years of experience. Through their efforts, we have evolved from two strong regional companies into a recognized global leader. In July 2021, Brookfield Business Partners L.P., announced the agreement to acquire DexKo for approximately $3.7 billion, including the estimated total cash consideration of $279.0 million to be paid for the acquisition of Brink.

In addition, we also operate 23 plants that manufacture other product offerings. Our demonstrated scale, proximity to our customers and vertical integration, positions us as a trusted supply chain partner. The vertically integrated nature of our manufacturing footprint provides flexibility for us to engineer, design and produce key sub-components internally at a lower cost than sourcing externally. With the optionality to manufacture critical systems in-house, we are able to have significant control over our supply chain. Our centralized sub-component manufacturing plants feed inputs to product assembly plants, allowing efficient servicing of demand at what we believe are 10% to 15% lower production costs than competitors, and results in what we believe are shorter lead times than competitors that have to source from third-party suppliers. Furthermore, our manufacturing footprint has a highly flexible cost structure, as approximately 80% of our cash costs are variable.

Upon satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the net proceeds will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.” If (i) the Escrow Release Conditions are not satisfied on or prior to the Escrow End Date or (ii) if we notify the Trustee and the Escrow Agent that the Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, from the issue date of the Notes, to, but not including, the date of such special mandatory redemption as described in “Description of Notes—Escrow of Gross Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate from the Issuer stating that the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, the escrowed funds will be released on the Escrow Release Date and utilized as described in “The Transactions” and “Use of Proceeds.” If the closing of this offering of Notes occurs on the closing date of the Acquisition, the escrow provisions set forth herein will not be applicable. The escrow account will not include additional cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the Notes, which is payable on the interest payment dates occurring in the period between the issue date of the Notes and the Escrow End Date or included in the special mandatory redemption price described above. In the event that (i) interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring in the period between the issue date of the Notes 24 ----- and the Escrow End Date or (ii) the special mandatory redemption price payable upon a special mandatory redemption exceeds the amount of the funds held in the escrow account, the Sponsor will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of the Notes, pursuant to commitments provided by them. Guarantees ................................................................... As of the date of issuance, the Notes will be guaranteed only by Holdings. From and after the Escrow Release Date, the Notes will be jointly and severally, unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and each of the Issuer’s existing and future wholly-owned subsidiaries that will guarantee the Issuer’s obligations under the term loan and cash flow revolver of the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility. See “Description of Notes— Guarantees.” As of and for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, before intercompany eliminations, our non-guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 33.2% and 33.0% of our revenues, 32.1% and 27.4% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 22.1% and 22.2% of our total assets (excluding cash), respectively. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes— Claims of holders of the Notes will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors of certain of our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes.” Ranking ....................................................................... Prior to the release of funds from the escrow account and consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be the Issuer’s senior secured obligations secured by a first priority security interest in the escrow account and all deposits and investment property therein. Following the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes and the related guarantees will be the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will be: - _pari passu in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness, including obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL Facility and guarantees thereof; - effectively subordinated to the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future secured indebtedness, including under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; - senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the guarantors’ existing and future subordinated indebtedness; and - structurally subordinated in right of payment to all 25 ----- existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any subsidiary that does not guarantee the Notes, including certain of our foreign subsidiaries that guarantee the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately (i) $2,595.0 million of long-term debt outstanding, (ii) $200.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the New Revolving Facility (including undrawn letters of credit), subject to customary conditions, (iii) $150.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the New ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability and other customary conditions and (iv) $280.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under the New Term Loan Facility, subject to customary conditions, all of which will rank effectively senior to the obligations under the Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. Optional Redemption ................................................... On or after          , 2024 we may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at the redemption prices described in “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Prior to such date, we may redeem some or all of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. In addition, we may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes before          , 2024 with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % of the principal amount of the Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” Change of Control Triggering Event ........................... If we experience a Change of Control Triggering Event, we must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. For more details, see “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control Triggering Event.” Mandatory Offer to Repurchase Following Certain Asset Sales ............................................... If we sell certain assets and do not repay certain debt or reinvest the proceeds of such sales within certain time periods, we must offer to repurchase the Notes as described under “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.” Certain Covenants ........................................................ The indenture that will govern the Notes will contain covenants that limit, among other things, our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: 26 ----- - incur additional indebtedness; - declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other restricted payments; - make certain investments or acquisitions; - create liens or use assets as security in other transactions; - merge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; - enter into transactions with affiliates; - sell or transfer certain assets; and - agree to certain restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to the Issuer. These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and limitations. In addition, so long as the applicable Notes have an investment grade rating from either Standard & Poor’s Investors Ratings Service or Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., we will not be subject to certain of the covenants listed above. See “Description of Notes— Certain Covenants.” Transfer Restrictions .................................................... The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. See “Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to list the Notes on any securities exchange. No Registration Rights ................................................ We will not be required, and do not intend, to register the resale of the Notes under the U.S. federal or state securities laws or under the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Absence of an Established Market for the Notes; No Listing ............................................................. The Notes will be a new class of securities for which there is currently no market. Although the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue marketmaking activities at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained. The Issuer does not intend to apply for a listing of the Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. Use of Proceeds ........................................................... We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the Initial New Term Loan Facility and equity contributions from funds affiliated with BCP and other investors, to (1) pay the cash consideration for the Acquisition and (2) pay related fees and expenses. 27 ----- See “Use of Proceeds.” Denominations .............................................................

Leverageable EBITDA is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use Leverageable EBITDA to measure liquidity and the performance of our business. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, net and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for, among other things, (i) 30 ----- (gain) loss on foreign currency related to intercompany loans and foreign currency derivatives, (ii) restructuring expenses, (iii) share-based compensation, (iv) business optimization expenses, (v) sponsor management fees and (vi) acquisition and purchase accounting related items. Leverageable EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain items which we believe are not reflective of ongoing performance. We believe that the presentation of Leverageable EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Further, we believe Leverageable EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, liquidity and in evaluating potential acquisitions. Leverageable EBITDA is also calculated in a manner consistent with the terms of the instruments that will govern our indebtedness. There are material limitations to using Leverageable EBITDA. Leverageable EBITDA does not take into account certain significant items, including (i) significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (ii) cash requirements for replacing assets, (iii) tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes, (iv) cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures and (v) all GAAP non-cash and non-recurring adjustments. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Leverageable EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.

As of June 30, 2021, approximately 11% of our employees in North America were employed under collective bargaining agreements with industrial trade unions and approximately 67% of our employees in Rest of World were employed under international unions or workers’ councils. We believe our relationship with our employees, including those represented by trade unions and workers’ councils, is in good standing. The health and safety of our employees is paramount at DexKo. Safety is a critical metric by which we evaluate our performance as a company and which we report to our Board of Directors monthly and as the first item of business at each board meeting. Our executive leadership team demonstrates its commitment to safety by actively participating in a variety of safety initiatives throughout the Company. Our goal is always to achieve zero recordable injuries in all of our facilities and we have continued to make significant progress toward this goal. We use proven 108 ----- tools and systems to identify safety hazards and mitigate risks. We emphasize learning from past incidents or near misses and we actively share safety information across our facilities on a regular basis. We continuously review and improve our safety programs and training. We require that all incidents be reported, recorded and investigated in order to identify the root cause and allow us to take corrective action and implement preventative measures across the organization. As of June 30, 2021, 55 of our facilities achieved our goal of zero recordable injuries. COVID-19 has presented new health and safety challenges. We responded to the challenge by developing playbooks of additional health and safety measures appropriate for the various types of facilities we operate and the countries in which we have locations. These measures included work-from-home programs where possible, shift realignments, social distancing, mask requirements, additional wash stations, temperature checks prior to entering plant facilities, daily health questionnaires, contact tracing and random COVID testing. These playbooks continue to evolve and we continue to communicate the importance of working in a safe manner to our employees on a daily basis. Enabling each employee to realize his or her maximum potential is another key priority at DexKo. We value diversity and encourage a culture that respects and values the unique attributes, ideas, perspectives, and experiences of each of our employees. We believe that in a global marketplace, a more inclusive and diverse workforce allows us to achieve better results and makes us a stronger business, and we seek to hire and develop diverse candidates and employees and to reinforce an inclusive culture through ongoing training and engagement activities.

We also seek to foster a culture of engagement with the aspiration of creating deeper connections among all our employees. We want all our employees to believe in our mission as a company, understand their role in executing our strategy and be passionate about DexKo and their careers.

In the late part of the first quarter and early part of the second quarter of 2020, we experienced significant demand volatility for our products, with significant demand reductions in the early part of the second quarter followed by very strong demand recovery in the second half. We could experience similar volatility in the future. The duration of the pandemic and the magnitude of its impact remain uncertain, and a prolonged or worsening disruption or a resulting economic recession could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The continuing surges of COVID-19 cases, along with new strains and variants being discovered and challenges associated with the roll out and availability of vaccines have resulted in the reimposition of certain restrictions in certain states and countries and may lead to other restrictions being implemented in response to efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Accordingly, the COVID-19 outbreak has severely restricted the level of economic activity in many countries, continues to adversely impact global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. Although most of our operations have been treated as “essential” operations under applicable government orders which restrict business activities, and accordingly have been permitted to continue to operate, it is possible that treatment as an “essential” business could change under future government orders or new restrictions may be added in response to the evolving conditions. Furthermore, some of our customers and suppliers may not be considered essential businesses, which could result in reduced demand or interruptions to our supply chain. We have experienced temporary shutdowns in certain facilities and we, our employees, suppliers or customers may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders, employee quarantine requirements, import or export restrictions or other preventative measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Further, site-specific health and safety concerns might otherwise require certain of our operations to be halted for some period of time, and we may experience significant absenteeism from COVID-19 infections and employee quarantines. Operations at our facilities have been modified for employee protection measures, including social distancing measures and enhanced cleaning regimens with greater frequency, which may continue to affect the efficiency of our operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, the facilities of our customers and suppliers may experience disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements due to the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, workforce or other manufacturing and distribution capability. We may also experience failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, distributors, contractors and commercial banks, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with our business, including those described in this offering memorandum. 34 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

If we are unable to sufficiently adjust to market conditions, we could fail to deliver on planned results, fall short of analyst and investor expectations, incur higher fixed costs, and/or fail to benefit from higher than expected customer demand resulting in loss of market share, among other potential adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

Some of our suppliers may not be successful in generating sufficient sales or securing financing for the operation of their businesses, and therefore may no longer be able to supply goods and services to us. In that event, we would need to find additional sources for goods and services, and we might not be able to find such additional sources on favorable terms, if at all.

Any such disruption in our supply chain could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis and thereby affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, changes in the availability and price of raw materials, components and whole goods, which have fluctuated significantly in the past and are more likely to fluctuate during times of economic volatility and regulatory instability, can significantly increase the costs of production which could have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if, due to pricing considerations or other factors, we are unable to recover the increased costs from our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

Although we forecast demand, additional plant capacity takes months to bring online, and thus increases in demand could result in longer lead times. Furthermore, shortages in raw materials, components or transportation capacity could also impact our production schedules and result in longer lead times or an inability to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity or source the necessary raw materials and components to meet higher product demand, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand. However, if demand varies significantly from our projections and we overbuild our capacity, we may have underutilized assets. For example, the current COVID-19 pandemic has caused 35 ----- manufacturing and distribution disruptions and temporary shutdowns of business at some of our customers and suppliers. These shutdowns, combined with decreased customer demand, has at times resulted in decreased manufacturing levels. Efficient operations also require streamlining processes to maintain or reduce lead times, which we may not be capable of achieving. Unacceptable levels of service for key customers may result if we are not able to fulfill orders on a timely basis or if product quality or warranty or safety issues result from compromised production.

Our profitability and growth prospects are affected by the global marketplace. Restricted access to global markets could impair our ability to export goods and services from our various manufacturing locations around the world, and could limit the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. Trade restrictions, including potential limitations on existing trade agreements and trade terms, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets and impair our ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services. These restrictions may affect our competitive position. Additionally, our competitive position and results could be adversely affected by changes in-or uncertainty surrounding-U.S. trade policy. Furthermore, the violation of any trade restrictions or of sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons, including financial institutions, to certain countries, or involving certain products could expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. Embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Russia, Cuba, Iran and Sudan.

These methods may include the acquisition of, investment in, or joint ventures involving, complementary businesses and divestitures. We may not be able to identify a sufficient number of suitable parties for these transactions or complete transactions with the parties we do identify. If we are unable to identify suitable parties or to complete strategic transactions on commercially acceptable terms we may not be able to capitalize on market opportunities with existing and new customers, which could inhibit our ability to gain market share. Transactions that we have entered into, including the Acquisition, or may enter into in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transactions do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on our investment. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the acquired businesses with our business. The integration of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of any acquired 39 ----- businesses with ours. Our failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating an acquired business into our existing operations or otherwise to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration of our acquired businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships and diversion of management’s attention.

Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries’ currencies. Those assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues are translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates to prepare our consolidated financial statements.

Substantial fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We anticipate that there will be instances in which costs and revenues will not be exactly matched with respect to currency denomination.

If we experience declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet our current and forecasted operating budget, we may be subject to future intangible asset impairments. Because of the significance of our intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Pursuant to GAAP, we are required to assess our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine if they are impaired on an annual basis, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful life and are reviewed for impairment upon triggering events such as events or changes in circumstances indicating that an impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the carrying value of the intangible assets and the fair value of the intangible assets in the period the determination is made. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions, protracted economic weakness and unexpected significant declines in operating results may result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. The carrying value of long-lived assets is evaluated whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that would result in an impairment review primarily include a significant change in the use of an asset, a significant change in the projected future cash flows generated by an asset or the planned sale or disposal of an asset.

While we believe that we appropriately instruct our customers on the proper usage of our products, we cannot ensure that they will implement our instructions accurately or completely. If our products are defective or used incorrectly by our customers, injury may result. Furthermore, other product defects may occur through our own product development, design, and manufacturing processes. Any losses that we may suffer from any liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our products, may divert management’s attention from other matters and may have a negative impact on our business and operating results. Additionally, we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products or other safety issues, or heightened regulatory scrutiny that could warrant a recall of some of our products. A recall of some of our products could also result in increased product liability claims. Any of these issues could also result in loss of market share, reduced sales and higher warranty expense. We currently carry insurance and maintain reserves, which we believe to be adequate for potential product liability claims. However, our insurance coverage may be inadequate if such claims do arise and any liability not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have been able to obtain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate to cover such liability to date, our insurance premiums may increase in the future as a consequence of conditions in the insurance business generally or our situation in particular. Any such increase could result in lower net income or cause the need to reduce our insurance coverage.

These protections may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any confidentiality agreements with us, copying or reverse engineering our products or developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements. These agreements may be breached and may not effectively grant all necessary rights to any inventions that may have been developed by the employees and consultants. In addition, these agreements may not have been signed by the employees of companies we have acquired or may acquire in the future. The unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others could reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business. We cannot guarantee that any patents, issued or pending, will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. Moreover, the expiration of our patents may lead to increased competition with respect to certain products. The ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights varies across jurisdictions and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary knowhow that is not patentable or that we elect not to patent and any other elements of our products that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. An inability to preserve our intellectual property rights may adversely affect our financial performance. Patents have a limited term. In the United States, the expiration of a patent is generally 20 years after its first effective non-provisional filing date. The patenting process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability or scope thereof in courts or patent offices, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing around our claims. Competitors and others may also initiate litigation to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. Protecting or defending against such claims could significantly increase our costs, divert management’s time and attention away from other business matters and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we cannot be certain that we do not or will not infringe third parties’ intellectual property rights. Any such claim, even if it is without merit, may be expensive and time-consuming to defend, subject us to damages, cause us to cease making, using or selling certain products that incorporate the disputed intellectual property, require us to redesign our products, divert management time and attention and/or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements. We may be required to pay substantial damages if it is determined our products infringe on their intellectual property. We may also be required to develop an alternative, non-infringing product that could be costly and time-consuming, or acquire a license on terms that are not favorable to us. Not only are intellectual property-related proceedings burdensome and costly, but they could take years to resolve and we might not ultimately prevail. Our current and future trademark applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions may not be allowed or may subsequently be opposed. Once filed and registered, our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. As a means to enforce our trademark rights and prevent infringement, we may be required to file trademark claims against third parties or initiate trademark opposition proceedings. This can be expensive and time-consuming, particularly for a company of our size. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. While we believe that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property have significant value, it is uncertain that this intellectual property or any intellectual property acquired or developed by us in the future, will 45 ----- provide a meaningful competitive advantage. Our patents or pending applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by competitors or rights granted thereunder may not provide meaningful proprietary protection. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to patents, trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.

We routinely incur costs in order to comply with these laws and regulations. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with environmental permits. The nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities. We could be required to investigate, remediate and/or monitor the effects of the release or disposal of materials both at sites associated with past and present operations and at third-party sites where wastes generated by our operations were disposed. This liability may be imposed retroactively and whether or not we caused, or had any knowledge of, the existence of these materials and may result in our paying more than our fair share of the related costs. We own, lease or operate numerous properties (many of which are sites of long-standing manufacturing operations), have been in business for many years and have acquired and disposed of properties and businesses over that time. Under some environmental laws, including the U.S. Superfund law and state law equivalents, liability for the entire cost of the cleanup of contaminated sites may be imposed jointly and severally upon current or former owners, lessees or operators of a facility, or upon any party who sent waste to a disposal site, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations could result in substantial costs, fines and civil or criminal proceedings or personal injury and workers’ compensation claims. If these environmental, health and safety laws and regulations become more stringent or expand to include a larger portion of our products or our customers’ products in the future, we could incur additional costs in order to ensure that our business and products comply with such regulations. Our failure to comply could also result in our failure to secure adequate insurance for our business, resulting in significant exposure, diminished ability to hedge our risks and material modifications of our business operations. We must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords.

The effect of this subordination is that upon a default in payment on, or the acceleration of, any of our secured indebtedness, or in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization of our company, the proceeds from the sale of assets securing our secured indebtedness will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after all indebtedness under the New ABL Facility and any other secured indebtedness has been paid in full.

We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the debt securities that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the Notes or the guarantees thereof could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or a guarantor, as applicable, (i) issued the Notes or incurred its guarantee with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the Notes or incurring the guarantee and, in the case of (ii) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees; - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of its guarantees left the Issuer or such guarantor, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; - the Issuer or such guarantor intended to, or believed that it would, incur indebtedness beyond its ability to pay as they mature; or 54 ----- - the Issuer or such guarantor was a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against it if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or any guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the guarantees would be subordinated to other indebtedness. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its indebtedness, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing indebtedness, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its indebtedness as it becomes due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction, the court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the relevant guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance or other reviewable transaction occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. The indenture that will govern the Notes will also permit guarantees by foreign subsidiaries, if applicable, to be limited to the extent necessary to comply with applicable local law, and these limitations could limit the value of the guarantees. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other indebtedness that could result in acceleration of that indebtedness. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (ii) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of Notes and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

The guarantee of a guarantor of the Notes will be automatically released to the extent such guarantor is released in connection with a sale or other disposition of the equity interests of such guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the indenture that will govern the Notes. The indenture will also permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary, which will result in the guarantee of such guarantor being automatically released.

We deliver exceptional products that our customers rely on. We strive to deliver superior quality, provide the highest level of customer service and offer our customers innovative solutions through customized products and technology. We offer a broad portfolio of axle assemblies, hydraulic components, chassis, aftermarket parts, and other related engineered products. Our manufactured products span over 65,000 SKUs and are sold under a number of well-known, market-leading brands, including our flagship Dexter and AL-KO brands. We offer over 30,000 additional SKUs throughout our distribution network. We serve over 40,000 customers globally. Our manufactured products are used in applications across a diverse set of end-use segments, including agriculture, commercial, construction, general industrial, livestock, landscaping, marine, military, energy, residential, RV, transportation and many other specialty end-use segments. The majority of our products are critical to the reliability, safety and performance of the end-products in which they are utilized. Given the high cost of downtime relative to the cost of our products, our customers and the ultimate end-users of our products place a premium on the superior performance and reliability our products deliver. Our two flagship brands, Dexter in North America and AL-KO in the rest of the world, account for the majority of our sales. Our other brands, including CM Trailers, Kodiak, Redline, Redneck, Rockwell American, Silent Drive, Aguti, Bankside Patterson, CBE, E&P Hydraulics, Nordelettronica, Safim, Sawiko, G&S Chassis and upon consummation of the acquisition of Brink International B.V., Brink, are also recognized for product quality, reliability, innovation and superior customer service. The foregoing attributes, combined with our ability to deliver customized products with short lead times, have created deep and long-standing relationships with our customers. Our customer base is primarily made up of relatively small companies that lack engineering expertise in our product categories, thus we enjoy an advantaged position within a highly fragmented industry. Our advanced engineering expertise and proximity to our customers deeply ingrain us into our customers’ product design, engineering and development processes, enhance our longterm customer retention and support premium pricing for our products. We operate our business on a regional basis through our two reportable segments, North America and RoW. Within the majority of the end-use segments in which we compete, we estimate our sales are approximately five times larger than that of our next largest North American competitor and approximately three times larger than that of our largest European competitor. In addition, we believe that we have the broadest geographic footprint of any single aftermarket distributor of light and medium duty components for towable applications in North America. In 2020, 89% of our net sales were in end-use segments where we believe we hold the number one or number two position, based on management’s extensive knowledge and expertise in the industry. We believe that we are the primary axle provider to approximately two-thirds of our customers in North America and we are larger than the majority of our suppliers. Based on management’s knowledge of the industry, we believe that our scale, combined with our vertically integrated hub-and-spoke manufacturing and broad distribution network, enables us to respond to customer requests with premium quality customized product solutions, on shorter delivery lead times than many of our competitors and at an attractive cost position. 76 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

In 2020, compared to 2019, the Company increased net sales by $27.4 million, increased cash provided by operating activities by $26.0 million, increased cash and cash equivalents by $107.8 million and increased Adjusted EBITDA by $21.5 million. In the first half of 2021, compared to the same period of 2020, we increased net sales by $440.5 million, increased net income by $41.5 million and increased Adjusted EBITDA by $67.4 million. In the early part of the first quarter of 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we generated strong sales volumes and completed the acquisition of Silent Drive, which expanded our product offering of specialty heavy duty axles. As the first quarter of 2020 continued, it became clear that COVID-19 would have a significant impact on our revenues and operations. Our products are used in a wide array of industrial and utility trailers that are critical to end-user applications in numerous essential industries. While our facilities were generally able to continue operating as essential businesses, certain of our customers took significant unplanned downtime to adjust production and inventory levels to anticipated customer demand, causing our net sales during the second quarter of 2020 to decrease significantly compared to the same period in 2019. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related volume declines, we immediately implemented an action plan focused on protecting the health of our employees, reducing costs and preserving liquidity given the macroeconomic uncertainty. Our first priority was to protect the health and safety of our employees by implementing our Preparedness and Response Plan, which included adjusting shift schedules to provide for social distancing, employee health surveys and temperature checks, enhanced cleaning of facilities and allowing our employees to continue to work remotely when possible. These measures continue to be in place. In North America, we significantly reduced costs by temporarily closing certain facilities, reducing our direct labor force, suspending our retirement plan contributions, reducing salaried workforce pay and implementing furloughs. Outside of North America, we implemented similar measures, as well as short-time work programs, often with the support of local governments. Throughout the world, we aggressively managed our working capital with significant reductions in accounts receivable and inventory levels. In the later part of the second quarter of 2020, end-consumer demand for recreational vehicles, boating and other outdoor activities drove rapidly increasing volumes for our products, particularly within recreational and light and medium duty industrial applications. End-consumer demand continued to strengthen through the remainder of 2020, resulting in record fourth quarter volumes. The increase in demand continued into the first half of 2021, which was bolstered by acquisitions and general market recovery. We responded by quickly increasing production to meet customer demand, while continuing to maintain our COVID-19 safety protocols. Despite record volumes and net sales, we continue to be impacted by strains on our supply chain that limit the availability and increase the cost of certain parts and materials and labor shortages related to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, these changes in consumer behavior contributed to a slight negative mix impact to our gross margin. Despite challenges related to COVID-19, we continued to implement our M&A strategy and in the fourth quarter of 2020 completed the acquisition of Nordelettronica S.r.l., which expanded our offering of electronic components. At the beginning of 2021, we acquired Redneck Inc. and Redline Products LLC (together, “Redneck”), a leading distributor of trailer components in North America. Together with our Rockwell American distribution business, this acquisition creates what we believe to be the broadest geographic footprint of any single aftermarket distributor of light and medium duty components for towable applications in North America, provides us with unique insights into end-consumer behavior and preferences, and increases our aftermarket net sales.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

The valuation of these assets and liabilities requires the use of estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets. The fair value assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. We generally engage third-party, independent valuation professionals to assist us in developing the assumptions and applying the valuation techniques to a particular business combination transaction. In particular, the discount rates selected are compared to and evaluated with (i) the industry weightedaverage cost of capital, (ii) the inherent risks associated with each type of asset and (iii) the level and timing of future cash flows appropriately reflecting market participant assumptions. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the fair value and tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and can vary based on the structure of the acquisition as to whether it is a taxable or non-taxable transaction.

The annual tests are performed as of October 1. In conducting our annual impairment testing, we may first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We have determined that we have three reporting units: North America, International Running Gear and Hydraulics. None of our reporting units are aggregated for purposes of the impairment test. Determination of our reporting units, impairment indicators and fair value requires us to make significant judgments and estimates, which are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. We utilize a third-party valuation specialist to assist in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of each reporting unit. These calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions including, but not limited to, market comparables, future cash flows of the reporting units, and appropriate discount and long-term growth rates. For the 2020 impairment test, we elected to perform a quantitative test for all of our reporting units. During our test, we determined that the estimated fair value of the North America reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value, the estimated fair value of the International Running Gear reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6% and the estimated fair value of the Hydraulics reporting unit did not exceed its carrying value. 89 ----- As a result, an impairment charge for the entire goodwill balance of the Hydraulics reporting unit of $70.9 million was recorded. The impairment charge was the result of the impact of COVID-19 on the products, customer base, and geography of the Hydraulics reporting unit and declines in forecasted sales within that reporting unit. A decline in the actual cash flows of our International Running Gear reporting unit in future periods, compared to the projected cash flows used to calculate the estimated fair value, could result in the carrying value of this reporting unit exceeding its fair value. Further, a change in market comparables, discount rate or long-term growth rate, as a result of a change in economic conditions or otherwise, could result in the carrying value of our International Running Gear reporting unit exceeding its fair value, which would result in the impairment of some or all of the related goodwill attributed to this reporting unit. As of December 31, 2020, the goodwill balance attributed to the reporting units was $354.0 million for North America and $446.7 million for International Running Gear.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

We evaluate the carrying value of our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence. Such evidence includes historical operating results, the existence of cumulative earnings and losses in the most recent fiscal years, expectations for future pretax operating income, the time period over which our temporary differences will reverse, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of this evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. In addition, the calculation of our tax benefits and liabilities includes uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We recognize tax benefits and liabilities based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these liabilities based on changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties and the impact of any tax audits, the ultimate resolutions may be materially different from our estimated liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. To develop the discount rate for each pension plan, yield curves applicable to the plan’s country or region are applied to the expected cash flows underlying the plan’s benefit obligations to determine a single equivalent discount rate.

These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate.

Our manufactured products span over 65,000 SKUs and are sold under a number of well-known, market-leading brands, including our flagship Dexter and AL-KO brands. We offer over 30,000 additional SKUs throughout our distribution network. We serve over 40,000 customers globally. Our manufactured products are used in applications across a diverse set of end-use segments, including agriculture, commercial, construction, general industrial, livestock, landscaping, marine, military, energy, residential, RV, transportation and many other specialty end-use segments. The majority of our products are critical to the reliability, safety and performance of the end-products in which they are utilized. Given the high cost of downtime relative to the cost of our products, our customers and the ultimate end-users of our products place a premium on the superior performance and reliability our products deliver. Our two flagship brands, Dexter in North America and AL-KO in the rest of the world, account for the majority of our sales. Our other brands, including CM Trailers, Kodiak, Redline, Redneck, Rockwell American, Silent Drive, Aguti, Bankside Patterson, CBE, E&P Hydraulics, Nordelettronica, Safim, Sawiko, G&S Chassis and upon consummation of the acquisition of Brink International B.V., Brink, are also recognized for product quality, reliability, innovation and superior customer service. The foregoing attributes, combined with our ability to deliver customized products with short lead times, have created deep and long-standing relationships with our customers. Our customer base is primarily made up of relatively small companies that lack engineering expertise in our product categories, thus we enjoy an advantaged position within a highly fragmented industry. Our advanced engineering expertise and proximity to our customers deeply ingrain us into our customers’ product design, engineering and development processes, enhance our longterm customer retention and support premium pricing for our products. We operate our business on a regional basis through our two reportable segments, North America and RoW. Within the majority of the end-use segments in which we compete, we estimate our sales are approximately five times larger than that of our next largest North American competitor and approximately three times larger than that of our largest European competitor. In addition, we believe that we have the broadest geographic footprint of any single aftermarket distributor of light and medium duty components for towable applications in North America. In 2020, 89% of our net sales were in end-use segments where we believe we hold the number one or number two position, based on management’s extensive knowledge and expertise in the industry. We believe that we are the primary axle provider to approximately two-thirds of our customers in North America and we are larger than the majority of our suppliers. Based on management’s knowledge of the industry, we believe that our scale, combined with our vertically integrated hub-and-spoke manufacturing and broad distribution network, enables us to respond to customer requests with premium quality customized product solutions, on shorter delivery lead times than many of our competitors and at an attractive cost position. 92 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

At least $35.0 million is expected to be available for the issuance of letters of credit. Under the New ABL Facility, we expect to have the ability to increase the amount of revolving commitments outstanding thereunder by $100.0 million and certain other amounts. The lenders under the New ABL Facility will not be under any obligation to provide commitments in respect of any such increase.

Asset-based revolving loans denominated in other currencies will be subject to interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus the customary equivalent to the Eurodollar rate. The applicable margin percentage for asset-based revolving loans is expected to be a percentage per annum and ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% for base rate and Canadian Prime Rate loans and 1.25% to 1.75% for BBSY, Eurodollar and SONIA rate loans. The applicable margin percentages with respect to borrowings under the New ABL Facility are expected to be subject to adjustments based on historical excess availability as defined in the credit agreement for the New ABL Facility.

Certain of our direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries may be co-borrowers under the New ABL Facility. Such obligations are also expected to be unconditionally guaranteed by Holdings and each of the Lead Borrower’s other direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (with certain agreed-upon exceptions). All obligations under the New ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are expected to be secured by first priority liens on the “borrowing base” assets, including accounts receivables and other receivables (other than identifiable proceeds of certain collateral), cash and cash equivalents and securities and deposit accounts (with certain agreed-upon exceptions), chattel paper, inventory, and rights, documents and general intangibles relating to the foregoing (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, trademarks, trade names and other intellectual property), insurance, instruments and books and records relating thereto and proceeds of the foregoing and second priority liens on the other relevant assets of Holdings, the co-borrowers and the guarantor subsidiaries, subject to customary exceptions and liens permitted under the New ABL Facility.

From and after the Completion Date, Holdings and certain of the Issuer’s Restricted Subsidiaries (as detailed below) will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer’s existing or future Foreign Subsidiaries, existing or future FSHCO Subsidiaries and any future Receivables Subsidiaries are not expected to guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors, as primary obligors and not merely as sureties, will jointly and severally guarantee, fully and unconditionally, on a senior unsecured basis, the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes or expenses, indemnification or otherwise, on the terms set forth in the Indenture by executing the Indenture or a supplement thereto. As further described in “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries,” in the future, certain additional Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer that guarantee certain Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor will guarantee the Notes, subject to certain exceptions and subject to release and discharge as described in this “Description of Notes.” Each of the Guarantees will be: - a general, unsecured senior obligation of such Guarantor; - equal in right of payment with any existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor; - effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor to the extent of the collateral securing such Secured Indebtedness; - senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantee of such Guarantor; - structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness, claims of holders of Preferred Stock and other liabilities of the Issuer or such Guarantor’s Subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes (other than the Issuer); and - subordinated to obligations prescribed by statute, such as tax, social security and labor. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions: - the Issuer and the Guarantors would have had $2,595.0 million in long-term indebtedness outstanding, $1,930.0 million of which would have been senior secured indebtedness outstanding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities; and 119 ----- - the Issuer would have had availability to incur additional secured indebtedness of $200.0 million under the revolving credit facility under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and $150.0 million under the New ABL Facility (in each case reduced by the amount of borrowings of loans and any letters of credit to be issued under such facilities on the Completion Date), subject to satisfaction of customary borrowing conditions (including borrowing base availability in the case of the New ABL Facility). After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Euro denominated tranche of the New Senior Secured Facilities will be incurred by and/or guaranteed by non-U.S. subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes, and as a result holders of the Notes will be structurally junior to those obligations. The obligations of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility will be (i) effectively senior to the Notes to the extent of the collateral securing such obligations and (ii) structurally senior to the Notes with respect to the liabilities of the foreign Restricted Subsidiaries under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility that guarantee such Indebtedness that do not guarantee the Notes. From and after the Completion Date, unless designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries in accordance with the Indenture, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” Under certain circumstances, we will be permitted to designate certain of our existing and future subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, before intercompany eliminations, the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries represented approximately 33.2% and 33.0% of our revenues, 32.1% and 27.4% of our Adjusted EBITDA and 22.1% and 22.2% of our total assets (excluding cash) of the Company, respectively. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or similar proceeding of any of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer or a Guarantor. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors, and all obligations of such non-Guarantor Subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility, will be structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantees. The Indenture does not limit the amount of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness and that may be incurred by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, including the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. As of the Completion Date, Holdings and each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the obligations of the U.S. Borrower under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility will guarantee the Notes. The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. This provision may not, however, be effective to protect a Guarantee from being voided under fraudulent transfer law, or may reduce the applicable Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its Guarantee worthless. If a Guarantee were rendered voidable, it could be subordinated by a court to all other indebtedness (including guarantees and other contingent liabilities) of the Guarantor, and, depending on the amount of such indebtedness, a Guarantor’s liability on its Guarantee could be reduced to zero.

In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or do not refinance the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL Facility and/or such future Indebtedness, such default or failure to repurchase any tendered Notes could result in amounts outstanding under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the New ABL Facility and/or such future Indebtedness being declared due and payable and/or cause Permitted Receivables Financings or other financing arrangements to be wound down. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

We have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that we could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and, in the case of Secured Indebtedness, “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) have made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Change of Control Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

provided further that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then the Asset Sale Prepayment Percentage of such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

provided that if the Issuer determines in good faith, within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, that the repatriation of any or all the Net Proceeds of such Foreign Disposition would no longer have such a non-de minimis adverse Tax or cost consequence to Holdings or its Subsidiaries or any Parent Entities, Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners thereof (taking into account any foreign tax credit or benefit actually realized in connection with such repatriation in the year of such repatriation), including any withholding tax, with respect to such Net Proceeds if such amount were repatriated as a dividend, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds shall be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant and (iii) in connection with any prepayment attributable to any Joint Venture, to the extent that repatriation of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Foreign Disposition of a Foreign Subsidiary giving rise to a prepayment pursuant to this covenant, violate any applicable organizational documents or any agreement of any Joint Venture (or any relevant shareholders’ agreement or similar agreement), in each case if the amount subject to the relevant prepayment were upstreamed or transferred as a distribution or dividend, the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied to reduce Indebtedness and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary; provided that if repatriation of any of such affected Net Proceeds is permitted under the applicable documents within 365 days of such Foreign Disposition, the relevant Foreign Subsidiary will promptly repatriate the relevant Net Proceeds and such repatriated Net Proceeds will be promptly applied (net of additional taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against as a result thereof, in each case by the Issuer or any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Issuer or such Guarantor and any Affiliates or direct or indirect equity owners of the foregoing) in compliance with this covenant. Any of the foregoing prohibitions, violations, legal liability events, fiduciary duty or similar considerations, capitalization requirements and/or tax costs or consequences, are referred to collectively as “Payment Deferral Events”. The nonapplication of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of any of the foregoing Payment Deferral Events will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuer or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. Any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale (other than Retained Asset Sale Proceeds and any amounts excluded from this covenant as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph) that are not invested or applied as provided and within the time period set forth in the second preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds”; _provided that any amount of Net Proceeds offered to Holders of the Notes pursuant to clause (1)(c) in the second_ preceding paragraph shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to the whether such offer is accepted by any Holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $190.0 and (y) 50% of LTM EBITDA (the “Excess Proceeds Threshold”), the Issuer shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all Holders of the Notes and, if required or permitted by the terms of any Indebtedness that ranks pari passu in right of payment with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”), to the holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness that is in an amount equal to $1,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof that may be 131 ----- purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, and in the case of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, at the offer price required by the terms thereof, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement(s) governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer will commence an Asset Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 20 Business Days after the date that Excess Proceeds exceed the Excess Proceeds Threshold by delivering to the Holders the notice required pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Net Proceeds prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). To the extent that the aggregate amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer is less than the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) (“Declined Proceeds”) for any purposes not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, surrendered by such holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in the Asset Sale Offer (or in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall purchase the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer (or Advance Offer), the amount of Excess Proceeds that resulted in the requirement to make an Asset Sale Offer shall be reset to zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion). Upon consummation or expiration of any Asset Sale Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. An Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Guarantees (but the Asset Sale Offer or Advance Offer may not condition tenders on the delivery of such consents). Pending the final application of the amount of any Net Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness, or otherwise use such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or an Advance Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the New ABL Facility contain, and future credit agreements or other similar agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may contain, restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes. In the event an Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the repurchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing the Notes. In such a case, the Issuer’s failure to repurchase tendered Notes would constitute a Default under the Indenture which would, in turn, likely constitute a default under such other agreements. 132 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

The Issuer may designate any Subsidiary of the Issuer (including any existing Subsidiary and any newly acquired or newly formed Subsidiary) to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary unless such Subsidiary or any of its Subsidiaries owns any Equity Interests or Indebtedness of, or owns or holds any Lien on, any property of, the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer (other than solely any Subsidiary of the Subsidiary to be so designated); provided that either (a) the Subsidiary to be so designated has total consolidated assets of $1,000 or less or (b) if the Subsidiary to be so designated has total consolidated assets in excess of $1,000, such designation complies with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.” If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the caption “— Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock,” the Issuer will be in Default of such covenant.

These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations (collectively, the “Participants”) and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly (collectively, the “Indirect Participants”). Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the 221 ----- Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants in DTC’s system may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) that are Participants in DTC. All interests in the Global Note may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which are Euroclear Bank SA/NV, as operator of Euroclear, and Citibank N.A., as operator of Clearstream which in turn hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Interests in a Global Note held through Euroclear or Clearstream may be subject to the procedures and requirements of those systems (as well as to the procedures and requirements of such systems). The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own and the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to Persons that are subject to those requirements will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of Participants, which in turn act on behalf of Indirect Participants, the ability of a person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge those interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of those interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing those interests. Except as described below, beneficial owners of an interest in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in registered certificated form (“Certificated Notes”) and will not be considered the registered owners or “Holders” thereof under the indenture that will govern the Notes for any purpose. Payments in respect of the principal of and premium and interest on a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered Holder under the indenture that will govern the Notes. Under the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes, the Issuer and the Trustee will treat the Persons in whose names notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of such notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee or any agent of the Issuer or the Trustee has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the Notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe it will not receive payment on that payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount 222 ----- of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of the Notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of its Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of any the Notes, and the Issuer and the Trustee may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests of the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Note as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between Participants in DTC will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes described herein, cross-market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by its respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant Global Note from DTC, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a Holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of the portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as to which that Participant or those Participants has or have given the relevant direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended Notes in certificated form, and to distribute those Notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in Global Notes among Participants, they are under no obligation to perform those procedures, and may discontinue or change those procedures at any time. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective Participants or Indirect Participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including, but not limited to, the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan (as well as those plans, accounts or arrangements that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and entities that are deemed to hold the assets of such plans, accounts or arrangements (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”)) with certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) having certain relationships to such Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Plan that engages in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Any Plan fiduciary which proposes to cause a Plan to purchase or hold the Notes (or any interest therein) should consider the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such purchase or holding, and confirm that such purchase and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or the Code. Non-U.S. plans, governmental plans and certain church plans (collectively, “Non-ERISA Arrangements”), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to non-U.S., state, local or other federal laws or regulations that are similar to the foregoing provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”). Fiduciaries of any Non-ERISA Arrangements subject to Similar Laws should consult with their counsel before purchasing or holding the Notes (or any interest therein) regarding the potential consequences of an investment in the Notes under any applicable Similar Laws and the need for, and the availability, if necessary, of any exemptive relief under any such Similar Laws.

We have agreed that, for a period of 30 days after the date of this offering memorandum, we will not, directly or indirectly, take any of the following actions with respect to any United States dollar-denominated debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer, the Company, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries and having a maturity of more than one year from the date of issue or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any of its securities (“Lock-Up Securities”): (i) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of Lock-Up Securities, (ii) offer, sell, issue, contract to sell, contract to purchase or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase Lock-Up Securities, (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or any other agreement that transfers, in whole or in part, the economic consequences of ownership of Lock-Up Securities, (iv) establish or increase a put equivalent position or liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position in Lock-Up Securities within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or (v) file with the SEC a registration statement under the Securities Act relating to Lock-Up Securities or publicly disclose the intention to take any such action, without the prior written consent of the representative. The offer and sale of Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and the Notes may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. Prior to the offering, there has been no active market for the Notes. As a result, we cannot assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial offering price or that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after completion of this offering. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Notes on any national securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they presently intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. The initial purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes and any such market making may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the initial purchasers. In addition, market-making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about         , 2021, which will be the           business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade Notes hereunder more than two business days prior to the scheduled closing date for this offering will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+  , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes hereunder during such period should consult their advisors. 235 ----- In connection with sales outside the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons (1) as part of their distribution at any time or (2) otherwise prior to 40 days after the closing of the offering. The initial purchasers will send to any dealer to whom they sell Notes during such period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, United States persons.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

The acquisition of Redneck further extends the Company’s United States distribution footprint, increases its aftermarket sales and diversifies its customer portfolio. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company recorded $5.4 million of acquisition costs in connection with the acquisition. The pro forma effect of this acquisition would not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, either individually or in the aggregate for each period presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. As a result, no pro forma information has been presented. Additionally, the revenue and earnings of the entity acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2021 since the date of acquisition did not materially impact the Company’s reported results. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company preliminarily recognized $31.2 million of goodwill in the North America segment, which is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and expected synergies from combining operations. The Company expects the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase price consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7.6 Accounts receivable 10.0 Inventories 27.8 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1.2 Property, plant and equipment 9.9 Intangible assets 97.1 Goodwill 31.2 Operating lease assets 12.2 Other assets 0.6 Total assets acquired 197.6 Accounts payable 7.1 Accrued liabilities and other 4.9 Income tax payable 0.1 Operating lease liabilities 10.4 Total liabilities assumed 22.5 Net assets acquired $ 175.1 Intangible assets acquired consist of $56.4 million of customer relationships and $40.7 million of tradenames and trademarks with a weighted average amortization period of 13 years. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the residual amount recognized as goodwill, is based upon estimated information and is subject to change within the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments are recorded in the period identified with an offsetting entry to goodwill. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to certain current assets, current liabilities, deferred income taxes, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets.

Segment Information,282.55.1,,"The Company’s chief operating decision maker evaluates operating results and performance based on geographic areas and as a result, the Company operates in two reportable segments: North America and Rest of World. The Company’s primary products within these segments include axle assemblies, chassis, aftermarket products and other components. The Company evaluates segment performance based on external sales and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income (loss) before tax adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, net and other income and expenses that management does not believe to be indicative of core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA for each segment includes allocations of corporate costs for general, administrative, interest and other shared costs. Adjusted EBITDA is a primary measure of the Company’s ability to maintain and continue to invest in its operations and provide stockholder returns. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Segment asset information is not provided to the chief operating decision maker; therefore, segment asset information has not been presented. Due to the nature of the Company’s operations, external sales and Adjusted EBITDA are viewed as the key measures rather than an asset base measure.

Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method and includes the cost of materials, direct labor and allocations of variable and fixed manufacturing overhead. Management periodically analyzes inventory levels, historical usage and market conditions to determine whether there is any excess or obsolete inventory. To the extent management determines it is holding excess or obsolete inventory, the inventory is written down to its net realizable value. ----- Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, and depreciation is recorded over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in cost of goods sold. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset group is potentially impaired. If an indicator of impairment exists, the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset group are compared to its related net book value. If the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is measured and recognized.

The Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If management concludes that further testing is required, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. For the annual impairment tests, the Company elected to perform a quantitative test for each reporting unit.

For instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations and that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in end of period exchange rates are recorded within AOCI. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in AOCI is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized for which payment has been deferred, or expenses which have been deducted in tax returns but which have not yet been recognized as an expense in financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which provides that such valuation allowances shall be established unless realization of the income tax benefits is more likely than not. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. At each reporting period, the Company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, available taxes in carryback periods, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. There are two steps to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained. The Company considers many factors when evaluating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not correspond with actual outcomes. The Company records interest and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. ----- Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling costs are included in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company treats shipping and handling as a cost of fulfillment and records amounts in selling, general and administrative expenses, and as a result, its gross profit and gross profit percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other companies that may include these costs in cost of goods sold and in the calculation of gross profit.

Goods that customers purchase from the Company are covered by manufacturers’ warranties from the date of delivery. The Company’s warranties provide customers with assurance that purchased goods comply with published specifications.

These agreements also include reporting, financial and maintenance covenants that require the Company, among other things, to comply with certain net secured and total secured leverage ratios. In addition, the agreements require certain mandatory prepayments of outstanding loans, subject to certain exceptions, based on a percentage of the annual excess cash flow of the Company on a consolidated basis (with step-downs to 0% based upon the total net leverage ratio, and with no prepayment required if annual excess cash flow is under a specified minimum threshold). As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. ----- In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage a portion of these inherent risks, the Company may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments based on management’s judgment of the trade-off between risk, opportunity and costs. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including the identification of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management strategies for undertaking the cash flow hedges. The Company also formally assesses whether a cash flow hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties on its derivative financial instruments. The Company mitigates this credit risk exposure by entering into agreements directly with major financial institutions with high credit standards that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. _Net Investment Hedge: The Company uses foreign currency denominated debt, a nonderivative instrument, to hedge portions of_ the Company’s investment in foreign subsidiaries and manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.

These interest rate swap agreements hedged a portion of the underlying floating interest rate on the First USD Term Loan and Euro Term Loan associated with the First Credit Agreement and were designated as cash flow hedges.

Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2019, the valuation allowance in Germany with respect to an interest limitation carryforward of $1.7 million was reversed. Management also determined that as of December 31, 2019, a valuation allowance was no longer needed in the U.S. against the interest limitation carryforward of $12.8 million as management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred taxes are realizable.

Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We have determined that we have three reporting units: North America, International Running Gear and Hydraulics. None of our reporting units are aggregated for purposes of the impairment test. For the 2020 impairment test, the Company elected to perform a quantitative test for all reporting units. For the North America and International Running Gear reporting units, the Company determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded their carrying value. For the Hydraulics reporting unit, the estimated fair value did not exceed its carrying value, and an impairment charge for the entire goodwill balance of $70.9 million was recorded. The impairment charge was the result of the impact of COVID-19 on the products, customer base, and geography of the Hydraulics reporting unit and declines in forecasted sales within that reporting unit. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. Fair value of each reporting unit is estimated based on a combination of discounted cash flows and the use of pricing multiples derived from an analysis of comparable public companies multiplied against historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of each reporting unit. Significant assumptions used in the estimate include market comparables, future cash flows of the reporting unit, discount rates and long-term growth rates.",N/A,as_expected,2021,305

The First USD Term Loan and Euro Term Loan mature on July 24, 2024. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on July 24, 2022. Of the €350.0 million Euro Term Loan, €100.0 million was borrowed by the Company’s international operations. The remaining €250.0 million debt obligation was designated as a net investment hedge. Prior to the Amendment (as defined below), the First USD Term Loan bore interest based on the Company’s net total leverage ratio, as defined in the First Credit Agreement, and at the Company’s option of alternative base rate (“ABR”) or Adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margins ranging from 2.75% to 4.00%. Prior to the Amendment, the Euro Term Loan bore interest at Adjusted EURIBOR plus an applicable margin of 4.50%. The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest based on the Company’s net first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the First Credit Agreement, and at the Company’s option of base rate (“BBR”), ABR or Adjusted LIBOR plus applicable margins ranging from 2.00% to 3.50%. All amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility are available to draw until the maturity date. This facility requires a quarterly payment of a commitment fee ranging from 0.375% to 0.50% (depending on the Company’s net first lien leverage ratio) times the daily amount of applicable available unused commitment during the preceding quarter. The weighted-average commitment fee on the Revolving Credit Facility was 0.50% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In March 2020, the Company drew down $143.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility to bolster its liquidity position as a proactive measure in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The entire $143.0 million drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in May 2020. The unused balance of the Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2020 was $143.6 million, net of $6.4 million letters of credit. On January 25, 2018, the Company entered into the Incremental Assumption and Amendment No. 1 to the First Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) to modify the interest rate and increase borrowings. The Amendment reduced the interest rate from an initial applicable margin range of 2.75% to 4.00% per annum to an amended applicable margin range of 2.25% to 3.50% on the First ----- Term Loan. The Amendment increased the First USD Term Loan and the Euro Term Loan by $30.0 million and €20.0 million, respectively. In addition, the Amendment included a $50.0 million delayed draw on the First USD Term Loan and a €90.0 million delayed draw on the Euro Term Loan. The Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of $3.4 million in connection with the Amendment. The Company recorded a loss on refinancing of debt of $1.5 million consisting of new and unamortized debt issuance costs, which is recorded in other (income) expense, net within the consolidated statements of operations. On September 20, 2019, the Company entered into the Incremental Assumption Agreement No. 2 to the First Lien Syndicated Facility Agreement (the “Second Amendment”). The Second Amendment provides the Company with a new tranche of Term Loans consisting of a €180.0 million Euro denominated term loan (the “Euro Term B-3 Loan”), which was used to finance the Safim acquisition. The Euro Term B-3 Loan matures on July 24, 2024 and bears interest at Adjusted EURIBOR plus an applicable margin of 4.00%.

As of the adoption date, the standard resulted in recognition of additional lease assets and lease liabilities of $106.7 million and $106.9 million, respectively. No adjustment to retained earnings resulted from the adoption of the standard. The Company elected the transition package of practical expedients, which permitted the Company to not reassess prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs under the new standard. The Company also elected the practical expedient to not reassess the classification of land easements under the new standard. The Company did not elect the practical expedients related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component or the use of hindsight in determining the lease term and in assessing impairment of leased assets. The Company made a policy election to exclude all leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and without a purchase option that is reasonably certain to be exercised from recognition on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. Effective January 1, 2019, operating leases are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, with the exception of leases with an initial term of 12 months or less. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement date to calculate the present value of lease payments to record on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company has operating and finance leases for warehouse and manufacturing facilities, vehicles and certain equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining terms ranging from one year to 26 years, inclusive of renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Renewal options range from one year to 10 years. Some leases include options to terminate without penalty at specified periods. A portion of the Company’s facility leases are subject to annual changes based on various indexes.
