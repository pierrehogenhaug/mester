**MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for**
the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of
the securities described in the attached Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the
target market for such securities is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined
in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such
securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and
distribution channel(s) may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes
in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such
securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

discharge the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the 2% Notes due 2025 not validly

Notes due 2025”) on or about the Issue Date by depositing an amount in cash sufficient to redeem the entire outstanding
principal amount of the Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 at par, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to, but

Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 and (iii) pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. Whether the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will accept for purchase any 2% Notes due 2025 validly tendered in the Tender Offer is subject,
without limitation, to (a) the successful completion of the Offering in an aggregate principal amount and on terms that are
satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in its sole discretion and (b) the drawing of the Facility B on or prior to the
settlement date of the Tender Offer, currently expected to be April 18, 2024, subject to the right of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, in its absolute and sole discretion, to extend, re-open, withdraw and/or terminate the Tender Offer, as applicable (the
“Tender Settlement Date”). The closing of the Offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the Tender Offer. See “Use
_of Proceeds.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes at a rate of % per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on each     and   , commencing on   , 2024. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on   , 2029.

redemption price equal to 102% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest to, but not including, the applicable redemption date and Additional Amounts, if any, and (B) prior to   , 2026, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes

-----

in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured
Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain
outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other holder of
Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer. Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control,
each holder of the Senior Secured Notes may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Senior
Secured Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional

secures on a first-priority basis the liabilities under the Senior Facilities (as defined herein) and certain hedging obligations,
and may also secure certain future indebtedness. A portion of the Collateral also secures the Senior Notes (as defined herein)
on a second-priority basis. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.” The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and
the Collateral will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests
_and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Senior Secured Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes

that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU
on markets in financial instruments, as amended.

this Offering Memorandum is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
offense.

This Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in
matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons
falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (high net worth companies, unincorporated associations, etc.) of
the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom or (iv) are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) (the “FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of any
Senior Secured Notes may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all
such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed

**_UK MIFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for_**
the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of
the Senior Secured Notes, taking into account the five categories referred to in item 18 of the Guidelines
published by the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) on 5 February 2018 (in
accordance with the FCA’s policy statement entitled “Brexit our approach to EU non-legislative
materials”), has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes is only
eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”),
and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured Notes (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook
(the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the_**
Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should

not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the UK. For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No. 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key
information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities described in
the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been
prepared, and therefore, offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Senior Secured Notes to
be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Senior Secured Notes.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes
in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from a
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**_MIFID II Product Governance/Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market: Solely for the_**
purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes
is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s)
may vary in relation to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant
jurisdiction. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such debt securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors: The Senior Secured Notes are not_**
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 (as amended, the “EU Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has
been prepared and therefore, offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of the foregoing, the expression “offering” includes the communication in any form
and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Senior Secured Notes to
be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Senior Secured Notes.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes
in any Member State of the EEA that is subject to the EU Prospectus Regulation will be made pursuant
to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for
offers of the securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the EU
Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering is not a public offering in the Federal Republic of Germany. The Senior Secured Notes
may not be offered and sold in the Federal Republic of Germany except in accordance with the
provisions of the Securities Prospectus Act of the Federal Republic of Germany
(Wertpapierprospektgesetz) (as amended, the “German Securities Prospectus Act”), the EU Prospectus
Regulation and any other laws applicable in Germany. This Offering Memorandum has not been and
will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has not

European Union (each a Member State), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed,
pursuant to Article 25 of the EU Prospectus Regulation. The Senior Secured Notes must not be

and this Offering Memorandum and any other document relating to the Senior Secured Notes, as well
as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in Germany or used in connection
with any offer for subscription of Senior Secured Notes to the public in Germany. Consequently, in
Germany the Senior Secured Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum and any
other offering material in relation to the Senior Secured Notes is directed only at, persons who are
qualified investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 2 No. 3 of the German
Securities Prospectus Act in connection with Article 2 (e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Any resale

Prospectus Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation and other applicable laws.

**Canada**

The distribution of the Senior Secured Notes in Canada is being made on a private placement basis only
and is exempt from the requirement that we prepare and file a prospectus with the relevant Canadian
securities regulatory authorities. The Senior Secured Notes may be sold only to purchasers purchasing,
or deemed to be purchasing, as principal that are accredited investors, as defined in National Instrument
45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario), and are permitted
clients, as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing
Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Senior Secured Notes must be made in accordance with an
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian
securities laws.

remedies for rescission or damages if this Offering Memorandum (including any amendment thereto)
contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the
purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or
territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the
purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.

Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or, in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a nonCanadian jurisdiction, section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33105”), the Initial Purchasers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105
regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with the Offering as the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is relying on an exemption based on U.S. disclosure.

amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”), nor exempt from the reporting requirements under Rule 12g3-2(b)

requirements of the U.S. Exchange Act. Pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and so long as
the Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, we will furnish periodic information to holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports.”

cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Information**

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH (“German TopCo”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (including the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by
the European Union (“IFRS”). Unless otherwise stated, all references to “Techem,” “we,” “us,” “our,”
or the “Group” in respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to
German TopCo and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless the context otherwise requires.

This Offering Memorandum includes the historical consolidated financial statements listed below:

- the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Group and the notes thereto as
of and for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (the “Unaudited Interim
Financial Statements”), prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34,
Interim Financial Reporting (“IAS 34”); and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Group as of and for each of the financial
years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, which are presented in accordance with IFRS
(the “Audited Financial Statements” and, together with the Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). The Audited Financial Statements have
been audited by our statutory auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft. Their auditor’s reports are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum, together with the Audited Financial Statements.

The historical consolidated financial information of the Group as of and for the three-month period
ended December 31, 2022 presented in this Offering Memorandum is derived from the prior-period
comparative figures included in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and judgments. These standards require management to exercise its judgment in
the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or
complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial
Statements, are disclosed in the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations.” Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro._

We have included the historical consolidated financial information of German TopCo in this Offering
Memorandum rather than that of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer because we report our consolidated
financial condition and results of operations for the Group on an ongoing basis at the level of German
TopCo. German TopCo is a holding company that has no revenue-generating activities of its own, no
business operations, material assets or liabilities other than in connection with its shares in German
MidCo, holding company expenses and the Group’s long-term incentive plan. German Midco is a
holding company that has no revenue-generating activities of its own, no business operations, material
assets or liabilities other than in connection with its shares in the German Holdco and receivables from
and liabilities to shareholders. German Holdco is a holding company that has no revenue-generating
activities of its own, no business operations, material assets or liabilities other than in connection with
its shares in the Senior Notes Issuer and receivables from and liabilities to shareholders. The Senior
Notes Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue-generating activities of its own, no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than in connection with its shares in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and those liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation, the Acquisition and the
Senior Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is the direct subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer and an indirect
subsidiary of German TopCo. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company with no revenue

-----

generating activities of its own and no business operations, material assets or liabilities other than its
shares in Techem Metering and those liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation, the
Acquisition and the Transactions. Consequently, no separate historical consolidated financial
information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has been included.

**Financial Information Presented for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023**

Unless otherwise indicated, and other than for percentages and ratios, the financial information of the
Group for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, represents the mathematical calculation of
subtracting the applicable financial information for the three months ended December 31, 2022 from
the applicable financial information for the year ended September 30, 2023, and adding the applicable
financial information for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The financial information of the
Group for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 has not been audited or reviewed by our
auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted
accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not
necessarily representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future period or any
financial position at any past or future date.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Certain parts of this Offering Memorandum contain non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, including
EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, free cash flow,
working capital, and leverage and coverage ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance
with, IFRS. Such measures and ratios may not reflect accurately our performance, liquidity or our ability
to incur debt and should not be considered as a substitute to net profit/(loss) or as a substitute to net
cash generated by/(used in) operating activities or any other performance measures derived from or in
accordance with IFRS, SEC requirements or any other generally accepted accounting principles. The
financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. As used in this Offering
Memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

- “EBIT” represents net profit/(loss) before income taxes, finance costs, financial income and
share of profit/(loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method;

- “EBITDA” represents net profit/(loss) before income taxes, finance costs, financial income,
share of profit/(loss) of investments accounted for using the equity method, depreciation on
metering devices for rent, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use
assets and impairment losses on metering devices for rent, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and right-of-use assets;

- “Adjusted EBITDA” represents our EBITDA for the relevant period as adjusted for certain
items which management considers to be non-cash or non-recurring in nature, and as adjusted
for certain pro forma cost savings;

- “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” represents Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted for certain cost
savings or topline measures we have identified or contractually agreed in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2023, annualized on a run-rate basis;

- “capital expenditures” represent the cash outflows for the period indicated used for the purchase
of fixed assets, which are composed of: (i) metering devices for rent (capitalized as a result of
new installations and the replacement of meters); and (ii) plant and equipment (including
technical equipment and machinery related to Energy Contracting segment products and other
equipment such as data collectors); and intangible assets (including software developments);

- “free cash flow” represents cash flows from operating activities less cash flows used in
investing activities less income taxes paid/received;


-----

- “working capital” represents trade accounts receivable, contract assets and inventories less
trade accounts payable.

We present EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures,
free cash flow and working capital for informational purposes only. This information does not represent
the results we would have achieved had each of the transactions for which an adjustment is made
occurred at the dates indicated. There can be no assurance that items we have identified for adjustment
as non-recurring will not recur in the future or that similar items will not be incurred in the future. The
calculations for Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are based on various assumptions
(including the successful implementation of certain initiatives) and management estimates. These
amounts have not been, and, in certain cases, cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any
independent auditors’ firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not
give an accurate or complete picture of the financial condition or results of operations for the periods
presented, may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision.

We present EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and
working capital because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating
performance and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.
EBITDA and its variants as presented in this Offering Memorandum may differ from similarly titled
measures used by other companies and from “Consolidated EBITDA” contained in the section entitled
“Description of the Notes” of this Offering Memorandum and in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
For a reconciliation of EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA to net
profit/(loss), see “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and As
_Adjusted Information.”_

The non-IFRS measures presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to other
similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS.
Some of the limitations of each of these non-IFRS measures are:

- they do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital;

- they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest
or principal payments, on indebtedness;

- they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;

- although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and
Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; and

- other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA differently from how they are presented in this
Offering Memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

We have included in this Offering Memorandum Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA. See “Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Information—Other Financial and As Adjusted Information.” Run-_
Rate Adjusted EBITDA has been prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what
our actual results would have been had the cost savings presented therein been realized and fully
reflected in our results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, nor does it purport to estimate,


-----

project or guarantee our results of operations at any future date. Moreover, prospective investors should
note that the increase in Adjusted EBITDA reflected in Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA may be offset, to
a degree that may vary with the circumstances, by a number of factors, including the costs associated
with implementing our cost saving initiatives. The adjustments to Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are
based upon forecasts and estimates and are in part based upon historical information. Our estimates of
the impact of cost savings are based upon a number of expectations and assumptions, which may prove
to be incorrect. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize, fully or at all, any of these cost
savings, and the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings may be substantially higher than
our current estimates and may outweigh the benefits. Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as included in this
Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X under the U.S.
Exchange Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation, the UK Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any generally
accepted accounting standards. Neither the assumptions underlying the run-rate adjustments nor the
resulting Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA have been audited in accordance with IFRS or any generally
accepted accounting standards. In evaluating the Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA, you should carefully
consider our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.
Although certain of this data has been extracted or derived from our Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Offering Memorandum, this data has not been audited or reviewed by our independent
auditors.

**As Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain as adjusted financial information to reflect certain
effects of the Transactions on the indebtedness, cash position and interest expense of the Group as of
and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. See “Summary Consolidated Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial and Other Information.” This as adjusted financial information has been_
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual interest expense would
have been had the Transactions occurred on January 1, 2023 or what our actual cash position or
indebtedness would have been had the Transactions occurred on December 31, 2023, nor does it purport
to project our indebtedness, cash position or interest expense at any future date. The as adjusted financial
information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the
U.S. Securities Act, the EU Prospectus Regulation or any generally accepted accounting standards. The
as adjusted financial information has not been audited or reviewed.

**Defined Terms and Financial Information**

Where financial information in the tables in this Offering Memorandum is labeled “audited,” this means
that it was taken from the Audited Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. The label “unaudited” is used in the tables in this Offering Memorandum when the
information has not been taken from these financial statements but was taken or derived from the
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements, the Group’s internal accounting records or management
reporting system or has been calculated on the basis of the figures taken from the aforementioned
sources, unless otherwise indicated. Unless stated otherwise, all of the financial data presented in the
text and tables in this Offering Memorandum is shown in millions of euros, commercially rounded to a
one decimal point. Because of this rounding, the figures shown as totals in this Offering Memorandum
may vary slightly from the exact arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them.

In respect of financial data set forth in the main body of this Offering Memorandum, a dash (“—”)
signifies that the relevant figure is not available, while a zero (“0”) signifies that the relevant figure is
available but has been rounded to zero. By contrast, no such differentiation has been made in respect of
the financial data set forth in the financial information section of this Offering Memorandum beginning
on page F-1. In the financial information section, zero (“0”) is used to signify both unavailable figures
and figures which are either exactly zero or have been rounded to zero.

The contents of any website, including the websites of the Sponsors (as defined herein) or any member
of the Group, do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

**SUMMARY**

_This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. It is_
_not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in_
_the Senior Secured Notes. You should read this Offering Memorandum carefully in its entirety,_
_including the sections entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry” and “Business,” as well as our Consolidated_
_Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading digitally driven energy services provider for the real estate sector in Europe with a
strong track record of managing complexity for our customers. This stems from our historically strong
business in submetering as well as significant offerings in energy contracting and other building and
energy related services. We are active in 18 countries, all located in Europe except for Brazil, and hold
top one or top two positions in most of these countries. We believe we are a leading provider in the
European energy services market, in particular in the residential submetering market in Germany where
we believe to have a relative market share of approximately 27% based on revenue for the financial
year ended September 30, 2022, and the largest installed asset base of heat and water meter devices.
While our business is not regulated, it is supported by the regulatory framework our customers face and
we see ourselves as their service provider to help them fulfill growing regulatory requirements.

We organize our business into the two reportable segments: Energy Services, which offers submetering
and cost allocation services, ancillary energy efficiency solutions and supplementary products and
services, and Energy Efficiency Solutions, where we procure, convert and supply energy to our
customers. Energy Services consists of the business operating lines Energy Services Germany and
Energy Services International, which oversees the development and strategy across 17 countries. All of
these countries are located in Europe, with the exception of Brazil. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023, our Energy Services business segment generated external revenues of €863.8
million. Germany generated 61.0% of these revenues, with the remainder generated by our operations
outside Germany. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, our Energy Efficiency Solutions
business segment generated external revenues of €148.6 million.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenue of €1,012.5 million. In
addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we generated free cash flow of €130.0
million and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of €534.6 million.

We leverage our scale, expertise, access to the real estate sector and the large amount of energy
consumption information we compile through submetering to provide additional energy efficiency
solutions and to respond to the shift towards an increasing emphasis on health within properties.
Services include smoke detection, water testing, energy contracting, metering point operations
(“MPO”), digital heat chain (control) (“DHC”) services and electric vehicle charging (“EV Charging”).
We plan to define a new market by introducing a new multi-sensor device (“MSD”) as an alternative to
the classical smoke detector with the replacement cycle in Germany in 2024, developed together with
Vonovia, that comprises smoke detection and climate monitoring (including heat, carbon monoxide and
mold detection) as well as humidity and temperature sensors. Our services are integrated as we bundle
our cloud-based infrastructure, digital infrastructure in properties, and our deep and long-standing
domain expertise in one technologically advanced platform – our One Digital Platform. This platform
is a key enabler for the majority of our offerings.

We believe digitalization is key to achieving climate-neutrality in the real estate sector. Consequently,
we have strategically digitalized our business processes in recent years, building a foundation for
optimizing our increasingly digital service offerings and improving customer satisfaction. We believe
that global digitalization trends will allow us to develop new and attractive value pools as we continue
digitalizing our submetering offering, while continuing to expand our business offerings. Our digital


-----

operating model allows for speed and adaptability in fulfilling regulatory requirements and developing
new digital services, while at the same time reducing human induced errors in the process.

To improve customer satisfaction, we redesigned our business model along customer journeys with a
focus on providing value-added services based on our extensive amount of energy consumption
information. Oftentimes customers turn to us when they face complex regulatory requirements, helping
us to design our products and services in accordance with customer needs. Supported by strong research
and development (“R&D”) and information technology (“IT”) capabilities we have created a digitalized
asset base. It provides us with additional efficiency gains and growth opportunities while
simultaneously yielding an improved customer experience. For example, we believe we have achieved
efficiency gains through our devices (designed to fulfill open metering system (“OMS”)) by providing
significant cost advantages over third-party OMS devices. These cost advantages stem from using
streamlined manufacturing services and bundling volumes for core components. We believe to have
deep expertise, in developing low-power electronics (with a battery lifetime of up to twenty years) that
have a high reliability over their lifetime.

Our track record is supported by the revenue growth at a CAGR of 11.2% over the period from the
financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30, 2023. Our past
financial performance has been supported by ENERGIZE-T, our value creation program introduced in
2018 focusing on quality and performance improvements, our _One Digital Platform, accelerated_
growth, as well as our cultural transformation. Through ENERGIZE-T, we have introduced a systematic
approach to further develop our business, create value for us and our customers and laid the foundation
for further growth.

Demonstrating our sustainability commitment, in April 2023 we achieved an ESG score of 8.7 by
Sustainalytics, rating our sustainability risks as in the lowest risk category “negligible.” This rating
ranks us within the top two percent of all ratings Sustainalytics has currently issued for business support
services companies. See “Business––Sustainability.”

**_Energy Services_**

Within Energy Services, we offer submetering and cost allocation services, smoke detection, water
testing, MPO and, in 2024, we plan to introduce the new smoke detection and climate monitoring
offering which comprises additional services such as climate monitoring as well as humidity and
temperature sensors that allow for mold prevention recommendations. While many of our services are
supported by the tightening regulatory frameworks which our customers face, we have positioned
ourselves as a broad service provider for the real estate sector for further innovative technology-enabled
services such as DHC and EV Charging Some of these products and services, such as the DHC or MPO,
are currently only offered on the German market, partially due to regulatory frameworks (in the case of
MPO) and partially due to our development processes. However, as we generally develop our products
and services for group-wide deployment, we may expand our offering beyond markets in which we are
currently active in.

_Submetering / Cost Allocation Services_

Submetering entails the metering of energy and water consumption of individual units within a multiunit residential or commercial building as well as billing services. Our submetering business is
supported by the EU regulatory framework which requires landlords to meter the consumption of
individual tenants and bill these costs accordingly. At the same time, the readings we obtain through
these services are the basis for some of our ancillary energy efficiency solutions. Submetering enables
our customers to regularly monitor energy and water consumption data and associated costs. Hence,
this offering raises consumption awareness among landlords and tenants who may adjust their
consumption behaviors. We believe that the use of submetering and the related consumption
adjustments can lead to a reduction of energy consumption in multi-dwelling buildings by
approximately 20%.


-----

Globally, we provide submetering services for approximately 13 million residential units and have
installed more than 67 million metering devices (including smoke detectors) as of September 2023,
with 5.8 million devices installed in the financial year ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30,
2023, 82% of our installed devices in Germany were radio enabled and approximately 60% of our
devices were cloud connected.

We also offer the rental and sale of hardware for cost allocation. In particular, we often sell service
contracts as we enter into sale or rental contracts of hardware, while our rental and sales arrangements
are often complemented by service contracts relating to the respective hardware. Hence, our broad
offering provides us with various key revenue streams.

_Smoke detection & climate monitoring_

We offer smoke detection and related services, such as intra-year function controls, with our devices
being connected through our digital infrastructure in a given property (our Techem Fixed Network).
This allows us to generate revenue synergies through cross-selling opportunities with our products and
services in our submetering business. Furthermore, our smoke detection and related services help our
customers comply with regulations related to smoke detection installation.

We plan to introduce our smoke detection and climate monitoring offering with the MSD as a
functionally enhanced alternative, which will include smoke detection and advanced safety features, as
well as value added services such as mold prevention recommendations, air quality measurement with
airing recommendations and continuous monitoring. Due to its advanced features compared to a
conventional smoke detector, we expect to be able to sell the MSD at a price approximately three to
four times of that of a current generation smoke detector. With our plan to sell the MSD in 2024, we
strive to make this device the new industry standard as older smoke detector devices are expected to be
replaced due to regulatory obligations requiring a replacement after a service life of ten years. We
believe that the roll-out of the MSD across our customer base will be supported by an arrangement with
Vonovia pursuant to which we have secured the sale of a significant number of MSDs, and we aim to
provide MSDs to Vonovia’s entire portfolio. As of September 2023, there were approximately 10.3
million smoke detectors installed in individual units, all of which were remotely monitored and
controlled. In the financial year ended September 30, 2023 we generated revenues of approximately
€58.0 million from our smoke detection business.

_Water Testing_

We offer water testing services for legionella prevention from initial inspection to laboratory analysis
in Germany and Austria, leveraging our existing customer base in our submetering business. Our
services, which we provide in cooperation with SGS Fresenius as an independent laboratory, help
customers in fulfilling regulatory standards, such as testing, certificate provision, service for legionella
prevention, analysis and they also provide concrete action recommendations for renovation of the
respective infrastructure. In addition, together with our laboratory partner we provide our customers
with negative tests certifications and reports for health authorities to assist them in demonstrating
compliance with regulations.

_Metering Point Operations_

Through our MPO activities, we are active in the smart metering business for electricity, gas and
(district) heat as we record and transmit consumption data of multiple commodities in our customers’
buildings. Smart metering systems are meters which are connected to a communication network through
a smart meter gateway. Our MPO business allows us to offer integrated metering and submetering
across major utilities ((district) heat, gas and electric power). Our business has been supported by
regulatory changes geared towards a liberalization of the metering market in Germany which allows for
metering systems to also be operated by third parties such as Techem. As a competitive third-party
operator, we are not tied to the price caps for operating a metering point and believe to stand out from


-----

competitors because of our value proposition that goes beyond the legal requirements for installation
and operating of a metering point.

While today our smart meter gateway is used in our MPO business, it could also be used in connection
with our submetering business in the future. Hence, we believe our smart meter gateways address future
regulatory requirements around cross-commodity measurement as they connect all metering devices in
a dwelling and create transparency about all energy consumption as an important prerequisite for
optimizing energy consumption and purchasing.

In Germany, smart metering systems for electricity are a regulatory requirement from 2025 onwards for
end-users who have an annual electricity consumption over 6,000 kWh and a controllable consumption
device (such as an electric heat pump). Furthermore, smart metering systems have to be installed for
operators with an electricity generation capacity of more than 7 kW. Smart metering systems are to be
installed throughout Germany from 2032.

In addition to enabling decarbonization strategies in our serviced buildings, we expect that MPO will
form the basis for further integration of renewable, intermittent energy sources to the grid and will be a
key tool for demand-side management. As of today, MPO provides energy consumption data. However,
in the future we believe that energy demand control signals will also be transmitted through MPO to
synchronize the generation of fluctuating renewable energy sources with the consumption of the
building. We believe that MPO will enable us to offer diverse, digital, and flexible business models,
such as landlord to tenant electricity supply models, for the energy transition in the real estate sector.

In combination with our digital submetering infrastructure, connecting all metering devices through
smart readers (data collectors) and MPO energy consumption data and contract information, we can
offer monthly, rather than annual, billing options. This allows us to offer a holistic view of a building's
exact energy consumption on a high-frequency basis. This would result in increased transparency of
energy and heat consumption which in turn enables transparency on energy costs and CO2 emissions.

_Digital Heat Chain_

Our DHC service provides an innovative solution to make the operational status of heat generation
systems for multi-dwelling buildings more transparent. See “Business ––Energy Efficiency Solutions.”
We launched this service for customers in the second half of 2023. With DHC, temperature and meter
data are collected from the central heat generation system and then transmitted into the cloud. In
combination with other data, property-specific models can be trained and mapped to a digital twin of
the respective heat generation system. This provides customers with an overview of the current status
of their systems. Through DHC we can swiftly provide specific recommendations to reduce energy
consumption and CO2 emissions by optimizing the setting of the generation system as well as reliable
notifications about malfunctions and failures in their systems. We developed our DHC service drawing
on our many years of experience in submetering, energy efficiency analytics of buildings and the
application of modern AI technologies. These analytics provide actionable recommendations for a more
efficient and safer operation of heating systems. Furthermore, the DHC comprises machine-learning
technology that further contributes to a continuous optimization of its analyses.

We believe that the DHC forms a relevant part of a building’s decarbonization strategy. We offer DHC
either standalone or bundled with energy contracting solutions. In addition to energy saving potentials
driven by a mere adjustment of consumption behavior (such as through use of submetering services and
the related consumption adjustments), the DHC enables for significant optimization of existing heating
systems, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This results in an additional energy saving potential
of approximately 15% at relatively low incremental cost for our customers. Our service works
regardless of the type, manufacturer, or age of central heat generation system and it is functional across
energy sources. This means that we can provide solutions for installation independently of the type of
boiler and other hardware installed. DHC solutions use a similar digital infrastructure as our
submetering services which provides us with efficiency gains and reliable technology.


-----

_EV Charging_

Given our long-standing experience with data-handling, energy consumption and billing, we offer a
comprehensive service for EV Charging stations in multi-dwelling and commercial buildings, with a
focus on Germany. Through EV Charging, we aim to make an active contribution to the expansion and
servicing of primarily privately owned EV Charging infrastructure. Our EV Charging service comprises
sourcing, installation, commissioning and operation of the charging infrastructure (as a rental or sales
model), with a particular focus on remote monitoring, user management and billing as well as
maintenance services. We provide largely standardized billing services based on actual customer usage
of the shared infrastructure and manage access and tariff configuration on behalf of our customers. EV
Charging stations are digitally connected to a back-end platform and to our shared IT-infrastructure.
Most of our services are based on a digital data connection and setup, allowing transparency in tracking
connected charging points. Our main revenue streams for EV Charging are service fees for multi-user
billing, and subscription and rental fees for the operation of charging stations.

Since 2022, we have been executing a project for the German Institute for Federal Real Estate
(Bundesanstalt für Immobilienaufgaben, BImA) whereby we aim to install, operate, and bill up to 1,000
charging stations for electric vehicles in more than 250 properties on behalf of them. As of September
2023, we have installed approximately 700 EV Charging points.

**_Energy Efficiency Solutions_**

Through Energy Efficiency Solutions, we offer energy contracting and energy consulting services to
customers in Germany. This business builds on our expertise in managing energy consumption and
leverages the extensive market understanding and real estate sector expertise we have gained over the
past decades. Energy Efficiency Solutions further benefits from our experience in heat curve behavior
and optimization, which enables us to run heating systems at high efficiency without impacting the
comfort of end-users.

The energy contracting services mainly include the planning and design, financing, energy provisioning
and operation (management and billing) of heating and cooling solutions. We typically involve third
parties for the commodity sourcing and the installation of these solutions. These projects are generally
customer-specific and tailored to the needs of the individual building and customer.

In recent years, we have shifted to focus on providing customers with primarily green and sustainable
technology (i.e., heat pumps) and addressing specific building requirements (e.g., less energy-efficient
buildings) with bivalent solutions (heat pump combined with gas boilers for peak demand). Today, we
offer renewable energy supply solutions with a usage of a minimum of 65% renewable energy as the
average target. In alignment with our sustainability goals, we offer new contracting customers primarily
renewable energy supply solutions, and we aim to renew existing contracts only with contracts that
include a renewable energy component. The energy management systems we offer comply with
ISO 50001 and are therefore a key instrument for the continuous and sustainable energy optimization
and decarbonization of our customers’ heating and supply systems.

We believe that the energy contracting market in Germany is much more fragmented than the
submetering and cost-allocation market. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we operate
approximately 3,000 heating systems for our customers. Our leading position in the submetering market
in Germany enables us to benefit from synergies, for instance, with regard to our market access efforts.
Furthermore, it allows for multiple cross-selling opportunities as we provide our customers with fully
integrated solutions across both Energy Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions.

In addition, we provide energy consulting services. These include assisting landlords, property
managers and other customers in their energy management with offerings such as energy monitoring
solutions and services to enhance cost and energy efficiency in light of ongoing decarbonization efforts.


-----

We believe these consulting services are highly important to our customers in the real estate sector, as
the regulatory landscape on energy provision becomes increasingly complex to navigate.

Consistent with rising energy costs and tighter regulations, we see a growing demand for cost effective,
high-impact solutions. In connection with the cross-selling opportunities, we continue to leverage our
submetering and cost allocation services with our contracting and energy consulting expertise to offer
further solutions to buildings already serviced by us. For example, we have developed solutions that
connect heating room optimization solutions with the demands of individual apartments and building
units. In addition, we believe that the decarbonization of buildings can only be achieved with the help
of its users and residents, thus, we aim to develop unobtrusive solutions with a high degree of acceptance
and user convenience.

**Our Strengths**

We hold top one or top two positions in most of the 18 countries we are active in. In our home market
Germany, we are market leader in heat and water submetering services. We aim to achieve a high level
of social relevance through our services, such as enabling a usage-based allocation of energy costs
(primarily in the provision of heat and water), thus inducing a monetary incentive for conscious
consumption. This relevance became evident in the 1970s as oil prices spiked, leading to the first
German Heating Cost Ordinance (Heizkostenverordnung) in 1981. This type of regulation has since
been adopted and further developed by the EU and implemented in most of its Member States, such as
the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency (EED), amended in 2018 to introduced requirements for
providing monthly consumption information.

Increased awareness around sourcing of renewable energy considering the political and regulatory
discussion on climate change, as well as efforts to decrease reliance on fossil fuels, recently particularly
in the EU in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022 (the “RussiaUkraine War”), has driven an increased shift towards conscious consumption of energy.

We believe we play a vital role in supporting the real estate sector in achieving decarbonization goals
and fulfilling regulatory obligations. Closely related to the submetering service, we have developed a
number of energy efficiency services that all aim at facilitating the reduction of energy consumption in
properties, such as our DHC that allows for digital monitoring of existing heat systems in properties,
and EV Charging. Our contracting business also focuses on decarbonization strategies.

We also support our customers to comply with ever more demanding regulatory requirements. For
example, in the context of the German Carbon Dioxide Cost Allocation Act
(Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz) and the energy cost relief programs, according to which the
proportion of heating and water costs borne by the landlord depends on the energy efficiency of the
respective residential building, it has become mandatory to specify in a heating cost bill the share of
costs to be borne by the tenant and the landlord respectively. Similarly, we are providing smoke
detection services, since, for example, it is mandatory in Germany for landlords to provide smoke
detectors and ensure their functionality within a rented residential property.

Expanding submetering into smart metering services, which can provide continuous and timely
monitoring of energy generation and consumption, increases awareness for energy usage, during
periods of high energy demand.

With our _One Digital Platform we bundle our digital metering technology, digital infrastructure in_
properties (our Techem Fixed Network), cloud infrastructures and our core systems (such as our own
developed billing engine HZ/3, our digital customer portal my.techem as well as data exchange systems)
with our long-standing domain expertise in metering, energy consumption and the real estate sector.
Overall, we believe to be well-positioned at the intersection of three of the global megatrends, i.e.,
digitalization, decarbonization and urbanization providing energy efficiency services on our
outstanding One Digital Platform.

**_Pan-European market leader with stronghold in the German submetering market_**

We are one of the leading submetering providers in Europe where we hold top one or top two positions
in most of the 18 countries in which we operate. We believe to be one of only two submetering providers
with a strong international market presence. Our international business is tightly connected to our home
market in Germany, leveraging economies of skill and scale developed and improved on in the German
market. This position is enabled through our device development and our One Digital Platform, global
purchasing, and production power, as well as cross-selling synergies.

We believe that our strong pan-European presence enables us to capture additional market share from
the increasing regulatory-supported submetering roll-out in many EU markets, while having the
technical, digital infrastructure to remotely service millions of existing devices.

**_Tech-enabled energy management pioneer delivering measurable customer benefit_**

We have transformed our business through digitalization and invested significantly into our core assets:
people and technology. Our digital value proposition is transforming the customer journey, while
increasing the efficiency and scalability of our business model. For example, a key capability and
strength is our ability to dynamically adapt our services to rapidly changing regulatory requirements.
We believe our proprietary billing engine HZ/3 to be the leading system in the industry. It is our
cornerstone for transactional data processing in billing. Furthermore, we believe we have been amongst
the leaders for radio-technology deployment in our sector. As of September 2023, approximately 82%
of our devices in Germany were using radio-based transmission, and approximately 60% of our devices
were cloud connected as of September 30, 2023. As of January 2024, properties in Germany with a
reading date on December 31 amounted to 304,462 compared to 299,300 in January 2022. As of January
2024, 86% of devices connected to smart readers were ready for billing within approximately ten
working days after the start of the peak winter service period on January 1st compared to 71% in January
2022, i.e., 63% of all properties (including with and without smart meters) in 2024 compared to 46% in
2022.

We believe that digitalization and open, interoperable systems go hand in hand. Thus, we have
embraced the vendor independent communication OMS standards. With approximately 56.4 million
OMS devices in use as of September 30, 2022, we believe we are one of the largest operators of OMS
devices in submetering and we strongly promote the use of this open standard.

Our highly connected digitalized asset base of approximately 67 million devices as of September 2023,
and the technological capabilities to manage complexity at scale are the starting point to expand into
other adjacent areas by providing ancillary services, such as holistic energy management solutions as
well as recently launched offerings, such as MPO, where in the German market we support customers
preparing for future regulatory requirements as these systems are to be installed throughout Germany
from 2032.

We believe our data and digital capabilities are leading in the submetering market and stand out in the
European energy services industry. Our market position today is a result of our significant investments
into the right expertise and the achievements of our digital teams, including _Techem X, our digital_
strategy lab, which we founded to drive customer journey-led digital product and service design and
development.

We believe that our refined digitalized operating model has led to measurable benefits for customers,
such as improved service, a reduced error rate and an increase in delivery time all of which is reflected
in reduced amounts of complaints and inquiries, resulting in low customer churn rates.


-----

**_Highly resilient, infrastructure-like business with strong support by regulatory trends_**

The submetering market is non-cyclical, with inherent macroeconomic and political stability offering a
solid base for a resilient financial performance, in particular as submetering is an essential service
required by law in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

The general market resilience is supported by the EU and national regulatory frameworks, where many
of our core services help our customers to comply with regulatory obligations. The megatrends of
decarbonization and urbanization give us regulatory support and we believe that it provides us with a
growing market opportunity in the future. Furthermore, we believe that laws are shifting to require
greater transparency in the real estate sector around utility consumption (i.e., heat, water, and power),
which our products and services are well suited to provide. The global temperature increase limit
committed by the Paris Agreement drives this need for the building sector, as approximately 40% of
greenhouse gas emissions in Germany stem from the building sector. This is expected to result in
increasing regulation and the decarbonization of the heating systems as the real estate sector aims to
become more environment friendly. Central boiler rooms in multi-family homes are today based on gas,
oil, or fossil fuel district heat. These systems, over time, will need to be replaced by renewable, carbonfree energy sources. Today we see a clear path to use heat pumps powered by green solar energy from
photovoltaic systems in most multi-family houses. We are able to provide users with this technology
through our green contracting business.

Additionally, we believe that new opportunities will arise for us as individual heating solutions in multifamily homes, such as single-story gas heaters in apartments, will be replaced by central, green heating
systems, such as heat pumps. This leads to additional necessity of cost and consumption allocation
through submetering. In addition, increasing urbanization leads to a growing market of multi-dwelling
buildings, further increasing the potential for submetering as these services are often required at the unit
level, thus increasing the number of devices in use.

Our water testing business in Germany is supported by the Drinking Water Ordinance
(Trinkwasserverordnung), which requires testing for legionella in multi-dwelling units with central hot
water systems. Similarly, our smoke detection business in Germany is supported by the building codes
of the German states.

General business resilience is driven by long-term customer loyalty and a low churn rate of
approximately 2% as of September 2023. Some customer relationships have lasted for significantly
more than 20 years, and we occasionally have customer relationships for more than 40 years. We have
a low customer concentration, with the top 10 customers in Energy Services Germany representing
approximately 6% of revenue, and our top 30 customers less than 10% of revenue, in each case for the
financial year ended September 30, 2023.

These external factors align with our own operational resilience, based on our outstanding One Digital
Platform, a lean operating model and strict steering based on our measurable key performance
indicators, which we have defined. Given our focus on digitalization of our services, we believe that
this will further strengthen the attractiveness of our services to our customers.

**_We have a resilient financial profile with predictable cash flows and consistent growth_**

Our financial strength is based on our attractive economic model, the strong resilience supported by a
stable and robust market environment, our service offerings based on our redesigned operating model,
high visibility of future financial performance already today, as well as our past financial success on
the back of our investments in our _One Digital Platform, which enables us to react quickly to our_
customers’ evolving requirements and at the same time provides further opportunities to offer additional
value-added services.


-----

Our economic model is based on our customer portfolio, which we believe to be well-diversified leading
to a low customer concentration, coupled with high customer loyalty based on long-term customer
relationships, and decreasing customer churn. This is further supported by the recurring nature of our
business due to the regulatory requirements our customers face and our services address. In addition,
today we enjoy the benefits of a lean cost structure and ability to scale, which in turn both allows for a
high operating leverage to capture economies of scale and to utilize the investments we made into our
_One Digital Platform across a large number of customers served and devices operated in Germany and_
abroad. In addition, we have a track record of high re-forecast accuracy. In each of the financial years
ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our actual EBITDA deviated less than 1% compared to our
re-forecasted EBITDA.

For over 15 years, our financials have shown a combination of both revenue and EBITDA growth as
we successfully withstood all major societal, political, and macroeconomic cycles and upheavals,
including the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War, and the subsequent
energy cost crisis, and did not experience a single year in which our EBITDA declined. At the same
time, we expanded our margin, which demonstrates our financial resilience. In addition, we have also
recently demonstrated our ability to accelerate growth on the back of the regulatory tailwind and the
successful implementation of our strategic and operational initiatives, by increasing revenue at a CAGR
of 11.2% from the financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30,
2023 and achieving growth across our segments and across our German and international portfolio.
During the same period our EBITDA accelerated and grew by a CAGR of 6.9% while Adjusted
EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 5.8%.

**_Complementary management team with deep expertise and strategic vision_**

Our management team has a strategic vision, a proven track record and demonstrated expertise in
digitalization, sustainability, transformation, and the real estate sector.

Matthias Hartmann joined in early 2020 as Chief Executive Officer to drive our digital and cultural
transformation. Mr. Hartmann previously held CEO positions at IBM DACH (Germany, Austria, and
Switzerland) and at GfK SE. Dr.-Ing. Carsten Sürig joined in March 2019 as Chief Financial Officer
(and Chief Performance Officer until June 2023) to drive performance and financial management, as
well as our holistic value creation program ENERGIZE-T. Dr. Sürig was previously a Managing Partner
at McKinsey & Company, Inc. Nicolai Kuß joined in December 2016 as Chief Operating Officer. Since
March 2019, he has been responsible for sales and customer service and has most recently taken over
the holistic leadership for the operational business in Germany as Chief Sales Officer. Mr. Kuß
previously held top management positions at large German real estate companies.

In recent years, we have looked to hire top talent with the skills and expertise required to help us succeed
and grow in our sector and beyond. We have transformed our company culture towards a more agile
organization, with an operating model focusing on customer centricity and invested heavily in our
digital transformation and data capabilities.

Overall, we have managed to attract leadership for the second and third executive levels from a wide
range of backgrounds, sectors and with diverse experiences. Our strong commitment to our vision of
making buildings green, smart, and healthy and advancing our sustainability goals, has become part of
our strategy. This commitment is a key driver for us while additionally serving as an attractor for top
talent.

**Our Strategy**

To achieve our vision to make our customers’ buildings green, smart, and healthy, we have set ourselves
a strategy targeting sustainable growth and increasing value for our stakeholders. We aim at
continuously increasing our efficiency and quality of services to reach an unrivalled customer


-----

experience and thus satisfaction. We offer digitally enabled, ancillary energy services from various
growth opportunities in our core business and beyond.

**_Delivering outstanding customer experience through digital platform and streamlined processes_**

Our strategy is anchored around significantly increasing customer experience and to step-change the
way our customers experience submetering and adjacent services. We believe that changing the way
how submetering services were provided for a long period of time and focusing on customer satisfaction
are important prerequisites to be successful in the future and to capture the significant potential arising
from the digitalization of the industry.

We have therefore significantly invested in our digital platform and processes to offer an improved
customer journey and to deliver superior service outcomes. We have put the customer at the center of
our business and redesigned our operating model and processes along the customer journey to tangibly
enhance our customers’ experience. Offering higher quality service and clear convenience benefits has
removed some former pain points customers had experienced and has allowed us to earn a positive net
promoter score (“NPS”). In addition, we have managed to materially reduce our customer churn from
4% in the financial year ended September 30, 2019 to 2% by September 2023, a strong testimony to
our improved service offering.

**_Increasing the digital penetration of properties with digitalization and efficiency offerings_**

Our goal is to further increase the digital penetration of properties under service in the medium term.
We believe to lead the market with a high digitalization rate of approximately 82% (share of our devices
in Germany using radio-based transmission as of September 2023) and which grew from 76% as of
September 30, 2019. We aim to increase this rate to almost 100% by 2027. An increased digitalization
creates the opportunity to automate and change key processes and to provide our core services much
faster and better, which are essential elements to increase the customer satisfaction through process
efficiencies. We plan to further optimize our operating model along the customer journey, leading to
further increased efficiency, as we aim to deliver even higher on-time delivery and reduced correction
quotas.

We aim to continue leveraging the power of data analytics and AI to drive efficiency and at the same
time create greater customer value, competitive differentiation, and growth opportunities. For instance,
with our One Digital Platform, we expect to achieve high growth rates and a rapid development-tomarket cycle of new services. Our goal is to help customers in real estate fulfil new regulatory
requirements they face in a swift and efficient manner.

In the past years we have started our transformation journey of process standardization and automation,
which we will continue to pursue in the future. We are convinced that this will lead to further costreducing economies of scale primarily through the continued extension and development of digital
solutions, adaptable to all our current and future markets. Our approach to standardization and
automation has also enabled us avoiding business performance bottlenecks we faced in peak times.

We plan to gradually reduce repetitive work in our offering and to increase the share of high-value,
digital tasks. This shift is supported by our holistic digital learning platform Techem Academy with
comprehensive training offerings, that has already won multiple external awards. This way, we aim to
further increase our attractiveness on the labor markets and to be a sought-after employer for top
employees and talents despite the shortage of skilled workers.

**_Seizing multiple growth opportunities across segments_**

We believe that the continued public and private focus to decarbonize heat production and optimize
energy efficiency in the real estate sector will require additional services to achieve these goals. We aim
to capture this potential and accelerate our growth by rolling out leading energy efficiency solutions
across markets at scale, further positioning us as the partner of choice across solutions for our real estate


-----

customers. We believe that this trend of optimization of energy efficiency has already contributed to
our past Energy Efficiency Solutions growth, contributing to revenue growth at a CAGR of 27.3% over
the period of the financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30,
2023, among other factors. We expect to maintain continued high growth benefiting from our
investments into digitalization, the operating model and our customer-centric approach.

In Energy Services, we expect our business in and outside Germany to benefit from various factors. We
believe to be able to participate from the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the EED which
will result in an expansion of opportunities in submetering across our European markets. To this end,
we aim to utilize our One Digital Platform for our respective solutions and to scale direct billing and
our digital sales channels. Furthermore, we expect to continuously drive service revenue per dwelling
based on our digitally enabled value-added services. In Germany we expect extended opportunities in
submetering in the commercial real estate sector, as digital measurements and recordings of the carbon
footprint will allow addressing regulatory pressure more quickly. We have also developed a new multisensor device (MSD), with which we aim at creating a new market next to the smoke detection only
devices. We believe to be well placed to create this opportunity and are planning to sell this device in
the course of 2024, thereby also utilizing the upcoming replacement cycle. Furthermore, our existing
submetering customer base in Germany provides us with additional upside to expand our water testing
services. In addition to organic growth, we aim to continue our successful track record of dedicated
accretive acquisitions of smaller submetering companies to consolidate the fragmented tail of markets
in which we operate.

The digitalization of our core business also presents opportunities in our new business areas such as the
field of multi-commodity and smart energy efficiency solutions. We see opportunities around the next
development stages of our DHC, such as scaling our offering across further markets, including new
functions and services, as well as metering service offerings for all types of consumption across all
properties. We plan to tap into this potential through our MPO business strongly enforced by the
digitalization and decarbonization goals of the German government. We also aim at growing the
services for planning, installing, and operating EV Charging stations as e-mobility is expected to
become more widespread. Lastly, we aim at expanding our white label offerings around our One Digital
_Platform, as we provide its billing functionalities to smaller submetering players, housing providers and_
municipal utilities who lack digital capabilities.

We expect Energy Efficiency Solutions to grow as we will continue focusing on green solutions based
on sustainable, electricity-based technologies (e.g., heat pumps, photovoltaic systems) complemented
by our digital metering capabilities. As we aim for a largely climate-neutral inventory of existing
buildings in Germany, we plan to convert all our existing fossil fuel heating systems to decarbonized
heat supply systems by 2045 and to win larger customer portfolios through strategic decarbonization
partnerships.

**Recent Developments**

_Current Trading_

Based on our accounting records for the five months ended February 29, 2024:

- our revenue increased by 1.1% to €508.1 million in the five months ended February 29, 2024
from €502.6 million in the five months ended February 28, 2023. This increase is primarily
driven by growth in our core business (billing and rental revenues), in addition to higher


-----

equipment sales within the Energy Services Germany segment, as well as strong organic growth
throughout the majority of countries in which we operate, mainly driven by effectiveness of
pricing measures and higher volumes within the Energy Services International Segment; these
developments more than compensated for the expected reduction in revenue from our Energy
Efficiency Solutions segment resulting from a decrease in energy prices (which is an item we
pass through to customers, and has therefore limited impact on our profitability);

- our Adjusted EBITDA increased by 7.3% to €275.1 million in the five months ended February
29, 2024 from €256.3 million in the five months ended February 28, 2023, mainly due to the
aforementioned top-line driven growth in the Energy Services Germany segment and the
Energy Services International segment and higher energy margin in the Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment, which more than offset an increase in personnel and other expenses; and

- our free cash flow increased by 9.9% to €75.6 million in the five months ended February 29,
2024 from €68.8 million in the five months ended February 28, 2023, mainly due to the
aforementioned top-line driven earnings growth in the Energy Services Germany segment and
the Energy Services International segment.

The financial results for the periods presented above are derived from our accounting records. This

and that approximately €5.1 million in non-cash guarantees under the Revolving Credit Facility will remain outstanding. The
Guarantors also guarantee the Senior Facilities on an equal and ratable, senior secured basis. The Collateral also secures the
liabilities under the Senior Facilities on a first-priority basis. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities
_Agreement,” “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior_
_Secured Notes—If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_
_Intercreditor Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and_
_future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor_
_Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement_
_of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes.”_

(4) The Senior Secured Notes will be general senior secured obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. On the Issue Date, the
Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees
will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Collateral, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 120
days of the Issue Date. See “Summary—The Offering—Collateral.” The laws of Germany limit the amount of obligations that may
be guaranteed, which security interests may be provided and the enforceability of the Guarantees and the rights to the security
securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. For more information on limitations to the validity and enforceability of
the Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of the Guarantors, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the
_Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

(5) The Guarantors accounted for 74.4% of our EBITDA (excluding intercompany transactions) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023, accounted for 69.9% of our total revenue (excluding intercompany revenue) for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023, and held 61.0% of our total assets (excluding goodwill, equity investments in subsidiaries and intercompany
transactions) as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, our
subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes had outstanding indebtedness of €2.4 million (excluding intercompany
loans) comprised of bank loans of various recently acquired small submetering companies in Germany, as well as a local bank loan
of Techem Brazil. This amount will rank structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the_
_claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

                   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future
indebtedness of the subsidiaries of that Guarantor that

The Guarantees will be subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Intercreditor Agreement.”


-----

The Guarantees will be subject to release under certain
circumstances. See “Description of the Notes—The Notes
_Guarantees.”_

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually
limited under the applicable Guarantees to reflect
limitations under applicable law, including but not limited
to, with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions
applicable to the Guarantors and their directors. In certain
cases, these limitations may apply to the Guarantees, but not
to the Guarantors’ obligations under other debt, including
the Senior Facilities. See “Description of the Notes—The
_Notes Guarantees,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the_
_Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial_
_assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations_
_on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect_
_the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral”_ _and_ _“Limitations_ _on_ _Validity_ _and_
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and_
_Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The Guarantors accounted for 74.4% of our EBITDA
(excluding intercompany transactions) for the twelve
months ended December 31, 2023, accounted for 69.9% of
our total revenue (excluding intercompany revenue) for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and held 61.0%
of our total assets (excluding goodwill, equity investments
in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as of
December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, on a _pro_
_forma basis to give effect to the Transactions, our_
subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes,
when excluding intercompany loans, had outstanding
liabilities of €2.4 million comprised of bank loans of various
recently acquired small submetering companies in
Germany, as well as a local bank loan of Techem Brazil.
This amount would have ranked structurally senior to the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The_
_Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be_
_structurally subordinated to the claims of creditors,_
_including depositors, trade creditors and preferred_
_stockholders (if any), of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.”_

**Collateral ...........................................** The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be
secured on a first-priority basis within 120 days of the Issue
Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, by:

                   - a share pledge over the shares in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer;

                   - a share pledge over the shares in each of the Guarantors;


-----

                   - a bank account pledge over the material bank accounts
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

                   - a bank account pledge over the material bank accounts
of each of the Guarantors,

(collectively, the “Collateral”).

The Collateral also secures on an equal and ratable, firstpriority basis the liabilities under the Senior Facilities and
certain hedging obligations, and may also secure certain
future indebtedness. A portion of the Collateral also secures
the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. The security
interests in the Collateral will be subject to certain
limitations under applicable law and may be released under
certain circumstances. Security interests granted by
subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be
contractually limited under the applicable Security
Documents to reflect limitations under applicable law,
including but not limited to, with respect to maintenance of
share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and
other legal restrictions applicable to the grantor of such
security interest or its directors. In certain cases, these
limitations may apply to such security interests to the extent
they secure the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees, but
not to the extent such security interests secure other debt,
including the Senior Facilities. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit,_
_financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other_
_limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may_
_adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the_
_Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**Intercreditor Agreement ..................** The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth various matters
governing the relative rights relating to our indebtedness
and obligations. The Intercreditor Agreement provides that
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with other senior priority obligations, including_
(i) obligations under the Senior Facilities, (ii) other
indebtedness incurred pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture that is entitled to rank senior to the
Senior Secured Notes with respect to the proceeds of an
enforcement of the Collateral and (iii) certain future
hedging obligations. See “Description _of_ _Other_
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.” In addition, if_
Facility B is repaid in full, pursuant to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, we may choose to designate the
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations
as a super senior liability, in which case the creditors of such
liabilities would be entitled to be repaid in full from the
proceeds of any enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral in priority to the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—If the_
_Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior_


-----

_liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor_
_Agreement, creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility_
_and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and_
_future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the_
_terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the_
_Intercreditor Agreement ranking pari passu with the_
_Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid with_
_proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes_
_Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**Optional Redemption ........................** At any time prior to   , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a
portion of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date, plus the applicable “makewhole” premium.

At any time on or prior to  , 2026, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Senior Secured
Notes, in whole or in part, following any Initial Public
Offering, with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding
the Net Cash Proceeds of such Initial Public Offering
received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as a
contribution to the common equity capital of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, at a redemption price equal to 102%
of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date and Additional
Amounts, if any, as further described under “Description of
_the Notes—Optional Redemption.”_

At any time prior to   , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may redeem, at its option, up to 40% of the original
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes with the net
proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption
price set forth in this Offering Memorandum plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date, provided that, inter alia, at
least 50% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured
Notes originally issued remains outstanding.

Prior to   , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes originally issued (including the
aggregate principal amount of any additional Senior
Secured Notes issued) in each calendar year at a redemption
price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes so redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

At any time on or after   , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes


-----

at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering
Memorandum.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem
all, but not part, of the Senior Secured Notes at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof (including accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any) upon
the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

**Tender Offers ....................................** In connection with any tender offer for the Senior Secured
Notes (including any Change of Control Offer or Asset
Disposition Offer, each as defined in “Description of the
_Notes”), if holders of not less than 90% in aggregate_
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured
Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases, all of the
Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
by such holders, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such
third party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured
Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part,
following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered
to each other holder of Senior Secured Notes in such tender
offer. See “Description _of_ _the_ _Notes—Optional_
_Redemption.”_

**Change of Control .............................** Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting
a change of control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must
offer to purchase each holder’s Senior Secured Notes at a
purchase price of 101% of the principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
repurchase. However, a change of control with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes will not be deemed to have
occurred if a specified consolidated total net leverage ratio
is not exceeded in connection with such event. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons ..**
If certain changes in the law of any relevant taxing
jurisdiction impose certain withholding taxes or other
deductions on the payments on the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all but not
some of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of the
_Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”_

**Additional Amounts ..........................** All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under or with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes or its Guarantee, as applicable, will
be made without withholding or deduction for, or on
account of, any present or future taxes in any taxing


-----

jurisdiction unless required by applicable law. If
withholding or deduction for such taxes is required to be
made in a relevant taxing jurisdiction with respect to a
payment on the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees,
subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case may be, will
pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amount
received after the withholding or deduction is not less than
the amount that would have been received in the absence of
the withholding or deduction. See “Description of the
_Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**Certain Covenants ............................** The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain covenants
that, among other things, will limit the ability of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue certain
preferred stock;

                   - make restricted payments, including dividends or other
distributions;

                   - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

                   - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                   - sell certain assets;

                   - guarantee additional debt without also guaranteeing the
Senior Secured Notes;

                   - create restrictions on the ability of restricted
subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments
to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

                   - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

                   - merge or consolidate with other entities or transfer all
or substantially all of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s
or a Guarantor’s assets; and

                   - impair the security interests for the benefit of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

These covenants are subject to a number of important
limitations and exceptions as described under “Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax**
**Considerations ...................................** For a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations of an investment in the Senior Secured
Notes, see “Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations.” You should consult_
your own tax advisor to determine the U.S. federal, state,


-----

local and other tax consequences of an investment in the
Senior Secured Notes.

**Transfer Restrictions ........................** The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not
been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may
not be offered or sold, except pursuant to an exemption
from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. We have not agreed
to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Senior Secured
Notes (including by way of an exchange offer). See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

from this Offering, together with a portion of the proceeds
from the Facility B, to: (i) pay the purchase price for the
Tendered 2% Notes due 2025, together with accrued and
unpaid interest thereon, up to but, excluding, the Tender
Settlement Date, (ii) satisfy and discharge the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in
respect of the Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 on or about
the Issue Date by depositing an amount in cash sufficient to
redeem the entire outstanding principal amount of the
Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 at par, together with accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, up to, but excluding, April 17,
2025 (the “Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 Redemption
Date”) with the trustee in respect of such Remaining 2%
Notes due 2025 and (iii) pay fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the foregoing. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

2% Notes due 2025 are validly tendered and accepted for
purchase by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to the
Tender Offer and (ii) the remaining 50% of the 2% Notes
due 2025 not validly tendered and accepted for purchase by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to the Tender
Offer are redeemed at par on the Remaining 2% Notes due
2025 Redemption Date, which is a level that has been
selected to represent the mid-point of potential outcomes of
the Tender Offer, and is not intended to be an indication of
the expected result. Actual amounts are subject to
adjustments and may vary from estimated amounts
depending on several factors, including the principal
amount of the Tendered 2% Notes due 2025 pursuant to the
Tender Offer, the Tender Settlement Date, the actual
redemption date of the Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 and
actual fees, costs and expenses. Any additional amounts
required to fund the actual amounts required for the uses
presented in the “Use of Proceeds” shall be funded by
Facility B proceeds. There is no assurance that the Tender
Offer will be subscribed for in any amount. Completion of
the Tender Offer is conditioned upon the completion of the
Offering and the drawing of the Facility B. This Offering

Memorandum does not constitute a notice of redemption or
satisfaction and discharge of the 2020 Indenture. Any such
notice will be given in accordance with the terms of the
2020 Indenture.

**No Established Market .....................** The Senior Secured Notes will be new securities for which
there is currently no established trading market. Although
the Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to
make a market in the Senior Secured Notes, they are not
obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making
at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure

_Memorandum. The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements are included elsewhere in this Offering_
_Memorandum._

_We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information for the twelve_

_Statements for the period from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023 to the Unaudited Interim_
_Financial Statements for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and then subtracting the_

_information for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, has not been audited or reviewed and is_
_not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting_
_principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily_
_representative of our results of operations for such a period or any future period or any financial_
_position at any past or future date._

_This Offering Memorandum includes certain financial information of the Group as of and for the twelve_
_months ended December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, including_
_financial data as adjusted to reflect the effect of the Transactions on our indebtedness, as if the_

(j) Represents the estimated full-year run-rate impact (to the extent not already included in Adjusted EBITDA) of the
_ENERGIZE-T value creation program’s measures which were fully implemented partway through the twelve-month_
period ended December 31, 2023, locked-in (e.g., contractually secured) or partially implemented during such period,
as if such measures were implemented at January 1, 2023, with the related EBITDA impact expected to be realized
during the next financial years.

(k) Represents the estimated full-year run-rate impact (to the extent not already included in Adjusted EBITDA) of new
business contracts which were secured partway through the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023 as if such
new business contracts had been secured at January 1, 2023, with the related EBITDA impact expected to be realized
during the next financial years. This also includes an extraordinary temporary installation backlog within the Energy
Services Germany segment caused by recent supply chain shortages and installation capacity constraints.

(l) Represents the estimated full-year run-rate impact (to the extent not already included in Adjusted EBITDA) of entities
which were newly acquired partway through the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as if the relevant acquisition
had taken place at January 1, 2023, with the related EBITDA impact expected to be realized during the next financial
years.

(m) Represents the estimated impact from the delayed delivery of cost information from customers and the resulting
temporary delay in the provision of billings services to customers. The reason for the delayed delivery of cost
information from customers is the delayed delivery of this information from energy suppliers, affected by the recent
introduction of regulatory changes following the energy crisis in 2023 (“energy price cap”) which many energy
suppliers have found difficult to implement into their energy bills to customers.

(n) Other represent miscellaneous adjustments, including the add-back of inventory and accounts receivable valuation
adjustments and write-offs (€3.6 million), as well as income/loss attributable to deferred compensation plans or trusts
(€0.7 million).

These adjustments are based upon various assumptions, forecasts and management estimates and are in part based upon
historical information. This information does not represent the results we would have achieved had each of the
adjustments occurred and been fully implemented on January 1, 2023. In addition, our estimates of the impact of cost
savings are based upon forecasts and management estimates and are presented on an annual run-rate basis as if such
cost-savings had been fully realized at the beginning of the relevant period. We may not be able to achieve these cost
savings in a timely manner or at all. The estimated cost savings are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance
on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The assumptions used in
estimating cost savings are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and
competitive risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our
estimates of cost savings. These numbers have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent
accounting firm. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. It may not be comparable to our
Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and should
not be relied upon when making an investment decision. Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are
included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating
performance and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS
and should not be considered as a substitute to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other
measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. Other companies, including those in our industry, may
calculate a similarly entitled financial measure differently from us, and so the presentation of such financial measures
may not be comparable to other similarly entitled measures of other companies. Funds depicted by certain of these
measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use due to covenant restrictions, debt service payments
or other commitments.

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking_
_statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this_
_Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business**

**_Our cost allocation business is influenced by regulation aimed at, among other things, promoting the_**
**_efficient use of energy and water. Amendments to these regulations could have a negative impact on_**
**_our business activities and significantly impair our prospects._**

In our core market Germany and other countries where we operate, the metering and billing of heat and
water consumption is influenced to a considerable degree by statutory provisions that are aimed at
promoting the conservation of energy and water. Laws and regulations that require owners and
landlords of residential and commercial units to provide consumption-based submetering and billing of
heat and water consumption and that allow for an individual allocation of submetering costs to endusers have proven to be significant factors for our business and our growth.

In Germany, the Heating Cost Ordinance (Verordnung über die verbrauchsabhängige Abrechnung der
_Heizungs-und Warmwasserkosten, in short: Verordnung über Heizkostenabrechnung), the Operating_
Costs Ordinance (Verordnung _über_ _die_ _Aufstellung_ _von_ _Betriebskosten,_ _in_ _short:_
_Betriebskostenverordnung), the building codes (Landesbauordnungen) of most German federal states_
and certain regulations serve as integral drivers of increased demand for our products and services.
Pursuant to the Heating Cost Ordinance, the owner of multi-unit residential or commercial buildings
with a central heating or hot water system or that is commercially supplied with heat or hot water is
required to meter heat and hot water consumption, respectively, of the individual units and allocate the
respective costs at least to a certain extent based on the individual consumption of the end-users. The
ordinance, however, provides for various exceptions from the obligation to provide consumption-based
metering and billing of heat and hot water use. Additionally, the building codes of most German federal
states (Länder) provide for an obligation to install cold water devices, at least in new buildings. We also
benefit from certain regulations requiring building owners to install and check smoke detectors and to
undertake legionella analysis. There can be no assurance that the Heating Cost Ordinance, federal state
building codes, certain regulations or any other future statutory provisions will maintain the current
requirements with respect to submetering of heat and hot water consumption, provision of consumptionbased billing services, the installation and checking of smoke detectors, and performance of legionella
analysis or that the exceptions to certain of these requirements will not be broadened. Any changes to
these ordinances and codes or any other future statutory provisions could have a negative impact on our
business.

Certain device type and production quality assessment approvals are required under national law
(including, among others, for heat cost allocators and devices in contact with drinking water) while
European conformity assessment and approval requirements are established under the Framework
Directive 2004/22/EC of March 31, 2004 as recast by 2014/32/EU of February 26, 2014 on measuring
instruments (the “MID”) (including, among others, for water meters and heat meters) and as
implemented in national laws. Similar assessment approvals are required for non-measuring devices


-----

(including, among others, radio devices and smoke detectors) which are regulated by various European
directives. Such approvals are necessary to enable and allow the marketing of our devices in Europe.
The approval procedures do not involve public authorities, but the producer implements so-called
conformity assessment procedures itself, which may, depending on the specific product, require the
involvement of external experts. The responsibility to ensure conformity with the evolving certification
requirements in order to maintain approval remains with the producer. Additionally, in Germany,
several of our devices are subject to the rules of the weights and measures regulations (for instance, the
Measures and Weights Act (Mess- und Eichgesetz) as well as the associated rules of the Measures and
Weights Ordinance (Mess- und Eichverordnung)). These rules require that installed and calibrated
water and heat meters have to be recalibrated at regular intervals. Generally, for practical and cost
reasons, devices are replaced, rather than recalibrated, at the expiration of the calibration period. If
future legal regulations prolong the validity of calibrations or the equipment replacement cycle, or if
our customers or we are found to not comply with these rules, our revenue and profitability could be
adversely affected, and legal proceedings may be initiated against us or our customers. For example,
we are, from time to time, subject to minor fines due to accidentally having used reading values of
metering devices not fully in compliance with the German Measures and Weights Act. Under certain
circumstances, such legal proceedings could also preclude us from participating in tender processes
from existing and new customers. The calibration authority in Hesse is currently requesting data on all
water meters installed in Hesse from major customers and metering service providers directly (including
Techem). The concrete intention behind this request is not known.

In the majority of the jurisdictions where we operate, most of the costs related to submetering, including
rental charges and maintenance costs, but also for the installation and maintenance of smoke detectors
as well as legionella testing, can generally be passed through from landlords to their tenants by way of
contractual agreement. In Germany, the allocation of operating costs to tenants is regulated through
legislation and is generally restricted by the principle of economic efficiency (Gebot der
_Wirtschaftlichkeit), which means that costs can only be allocated if an adequate cost-benefit ratio exists._
The costs for purchasing the devices may only be passed through to tenants under certain conditions as
costs for modernization by way of a rent increase. Such increase in the annual rent for residential units
is generally limited to 8% of the cost of modernization and within the following six years the monthly
rent may only be increased by two or three euro per square meter, depending on the monthly rent per
square meter of the living area before the rent increase. Besides a change to the pass-through regulation,
there is also an according risk that not all innovations in the cost allocation industry promoting energy
savings will result in products and services, the costs of which can be passed on to tenants. There is also
a risk that a change in an individual customer’s cost-benefit ratio will restrict such customer’s ability to
pass on costs for our devices and services, thereby reducing demand for our existing devices and
services.

Additionally, if costs are not allocable, owners and landlords may not be willing to invest in innovative
technologies because they are not the ultimate beneficiary of the resulting cost savings. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance that current statutory provisions enabling such allocation of costs will remain
in place. Any changes to the statutory provisions, for instance, by introducing caps or additional
requirements that must be met, or court decisions affecting the possibility of passing on costs for
submetering or the realization of any of the other abovementioned risks could have a negative impact
on our business.

Future regulation could also further encourage the interchangeability of submetering and data collection
equipment, decreasing our ability to differentiate our products and services from those of our
competitors. Key components differentiate our devices from those of our competitors, making it
difficult to replace or substitute our devices with those of our competitors. Thus, customers who wish
to switch from our products and services to those of a competitor may have to exchange their devices,
which can result in considerable costs, opt to revert to manual, in-person readings of their radio-enabled
devices, or they can further engage us to deliver the reading values to the competitor. Conversely,
convincing our competitors’ customers to switch to our products and services may be challenging due
to the incompatibility of competitor’s proprietary radio devices with our devices.


-----

However, given the increasing requirements to install remotely readable and interoperable metering
devices, it is possible that in the future it may become easier for customers to switch their submetering
provider, thus providing new business opportunities but also increasing competition.

In addition, our ability to retain customers also depends on our ability to enter into long-term
agreements, especially agreements for the rental of metering devices. In the past the German Federal
Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has held that a standard minimum term of ten years for the rental
of metering devices by consumers was invalid under applicable German contract laws. Future court
decisions or more restrictive consumer protection laws could have further negative consequences on
our ability to enter into long-term agreements with our customers. For example, the Law on the
Operation of Smart Meters (Messstellenbetriebsgesetz) already provides for a right of tenants and
landlords in Germany (if certain requirements are fulfilled) to choose a different metering point
operator. A landlord’s right to choose takes precedence over that of the tenant, provided the metering
point operator commits to (i) equip all metering points of a property with smart metering systems, (ii)
provide submetering services not only for electricity but also for at least one additional media (gas,
district or local heating) and (iii) not charge more than the total costs for all individual submetering
services. In case the landlord exercises this right, the existing contract is automatically terminated
provided that it had been in place for five years.

Furthermore, we cannot rule out that submetering services, under certain circumstances, may in the
future become subject to specific price caps. Such price caps already exist, for example in Germany,
for submetering services regarding electricity under the Law on the Operation of Smart Meters
(Messstellenbetriebsgesetz), where the costs that can be passed on to tenants are capped depending,
inter alia, on the electricity consumption level. For example, a recently proposed amendment which,
however, did not become actual law, also introduced such price caps for bundled submetering of heat
together with electricity.

**_Slower than expected implementation or governmental enforcement of regulations promoting the_**
**_efficient use of energy and water could have a negative impact on our business activities and_**
**_significantly impair our prospects._**

Statutory provisions aimed at promoting the conservation of energy and water have an influence on the
metering and billing of heat and water consumption. In particular, we are dependent on the regulatory
environment regarding the requirement for consumption-based submetering and billing of heat and
water consumption.

While the introduction of the Energy Efficiency Directive (“EED”) in the European Union (“EU”) in
2012, including subsequent amendments, offered the possibility of increased demand for our products
and services in other European countries by requiring, to the extent technically feasible and costefficient, individual consumption metering, not all member states of the European Union (“Member
States”) have adopted the directive as promptly or effectively as Germany. For example, not all national
implementations provide for penalties for a failure to comply with individual cost allocation
requirements, and, in some cases, existing penalty provisions may not be enforced consistently or at all.
As a result, expected penetration rates for submetering services have not always been met in the past
and may in the future not be achieved in all Member States in the projected time frame or at all. This
is, for example, the case for submetering requirements in France, where the actual implementation of
submetering has been slow and Spain, where implementation of the EED has only begun in 2020 and
is expected to be completed until 2027.

Any shortfall of the implementation of the EED or similar regulations, or a slower than expected
enforcement of these rules in Member States could significantly impair our prospects as it will reduce
demand for our products and services in those Member States.


-----

**_Our business is highly competitive and the level of competition may increase in the future._**

The geographic markets in which we operate are highly competitive. For example, five large providers
currently serve approximately 86% of the German heat and water residential submetering market. Due
to the maturity of some of our geographic markets, including our core market Germany, additional
market share can be acquired only by displacing competitors, which is achieved typically through better
service quality, broader service offering or competitive pricing. We also face competitive pressure as
some of our competitors operate by offering lower prices. For example, we recently experienced pricing
pressure in Poland for third-party water meter manufacturing. Because of our existing contractual
relationships with manufacturers, we may not always be able to offer water meters at the lowest price
and hence we may not be able to meet demand. Furthermore, even though the pricing of submetering
services in Germany is generally flexible, we may experience pricing pressure should any of our
competitors offer services at a lower price point in the form of service bundles.

Furthermore, constant technological advances and evolving regulatory requirements and industry
standards impact the competitiveness of our business. To this end, we are required to continuously adapt
our products and services to remain competitive. This includes updating our back-end systems and selfdeveloped billing software in order to provide our customers with correct cost allocation and billing
services. For example, from 2015 until 2017 the German Federal Cartel Office (Bundeskartellamt)
conducted a sector inquiry and proposed various measures promoting competition in the German market
for heating and water submetering such as introducing legal requirements regarding the interoperability
of metering devices as well as imposing requirements to include more detailed information in cost bills.
These measures increased competitive pressure as they required us to ensure that our devices comply
with such interoperability standards, and we also had to enhance our billing products and services so
that we are able to provide customers with bills containing further detailed information. Similar actions
could adversely affect our margins in the mid-term. Furthermore, increasing regulations in the real
estate sector regarding intra-year submetering services have been affecting us as a service provider for
the real estate sector. This has required, and we expect will continue to require, us to digitize our
submetering offering. If we are not able to keep up with the evolving regulatory requirements, our
products could lose their competitiveness. In addition, declining demand in the residential real estate
market resulting from increasing construction costs and rising interest rates may also affect our
competitiveness in the markets in which we operate.

Additionally, large customers increasingly require submetering service providers to tender for the
services which they require resulting in an overall increase in the number of tender processes. Such
tenders often increase the competitive pressure and generally result in large customers splitting their
contracts between suppliers, potentially at more attractive terms to the customers than they would
receive if they had only approached a single supplier. As a result of tender processes, our margins could
be adversely affected. Furthermore, customer contracts awarded in the context of tenders often provide
for more extensive cancellation rights for customers. Due to these factors, price pressure could increase
noticeably and force us to lower the prices of our products and services. Moreover, increased
competition could slow down or prevent our growth in markets in which we intend to increase our
market share.

Also, in certain countries in which we operate, European open metering system (“OMS”) standards
have been introduced, providing for open and vendor-independent standards for communication and
allowing interoperability between meter products, such as in Germany with its implementation of the
Buildings Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz) (“BEL”). The introduction of OMS facilitated the
development and offering of metering solutions for new market participants due to a reduction of
technical complexity, thereby increasing competition in our markets.

Increased competition could result in a decline in our market share and negatively impact our ability to
obtain orders and the pricing of our products and services. This, in turn, may reduce sales, margins and
cash flows and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of
operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.


-----

Further, competitive pressure may prevent us from expanding our current market position in markets
where we only have a relatively small market share, and we may ultimately decide to exit such markets
as result of prevailing competitive pressure.

**_The implementation of our strategy is subject to our ability to successfully market new and existing_**
**_products and services. Should customers not accept our products and services as we anticipate, we_**
**_may lose our competitive position or market share which could adversely affect our business and_**
**_results of operations._**

The implementation of our strategy as a digitally driven energy service provider with a digitalized asset
base is exposed to various risks. We are expanding our product offering for example by a multi-sensor
device that allows for smoke detection and climate monitoring and comprises humidity and temperature
sensors for mold prevention recommendations. The attractiveness of this device in Germany will to
some extent be driven by it qualifying as a modernization measure under German law allowing for an
increase in the annual rent for residential units. Due to the novelty of this device in our portfolio, we
cannot rule out that competent courts might not regard the installation of it as a modernization measure
which in turn would affect its attractiveness to customers. We also aim at expanding our metering point
operations business, our recently launched digital heat chain service as well as our offering for
electronic vehicle charging. However, demand for our new products, services and digital offerings may
fall short of our expectations and our competitors may be more successful at marketing their products
or there may be a delay in providing our products and services to the market.

We have only recently launched certain of our digital services offerings such as our digital heat chain
which provides digitally driven solutions to make the operational status of heat generation systems for
multi-dwelling buildings more transparent with the aim to reduce the energy consumption. Other
offerings are in early development stages and customers may not accept our new technology due to
higher costs or for any other reason. For example, some customers may continue to prefer printed bills
instead of a digital service. If demand falls short of our current expectations or if our plans are delayed,
we may not realize the benefits of our investments in the development and production of technology,
or our revenues may not grow to the extent anticipated.

Furthermore, complementing our digital value proposition as well as customer centricity, we aim to
differentiate ourselves from our competitors as we continue to optimize the integration of our Energy
Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions businesses. Should we fail to differentiate ourselves from
competitors, we are at risk of being regarded as a conventional submetering company resulting in a loss
of our competitive position or our market share.

A failure to implement parts or all of our corporate strategy could result in a loss of market share, for
example if we are unable to offer new digital services, and thereby impact our revenues. Further, our
cost base could be impacted, if we are unable to realize synergies from the further integration of our
Energy Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions businesses. This as a result could have a material
adverse effect on our business, and results of operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to liability in connection with potentially defective or incorrectly installed metering_**
**_devices, incorrect readings or billing errors, incorrect servicing of our devices, or in connection with_**
**_the operation of our CHP-units. Such liabilities could materially affect our financial condition and_**
**_harm our reputation._**

Faults or defects in our products can cause damage to the property or health of our customers, tenants,
or third parties and lead to significant damages. In accordance with applicable general rules of civil
liability, we may be obliged to bear such damages in whole or in part. Further, we might be required to
carry out a product recall and to pay the costs of procuring defect-free replacement products. Faulty or
defective products, product liability and warranty claims, as well as product recalls can damage our
overall reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of


-----

operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantee.

We use a large number of submetering and data collection devices, especially heat and water meters as
well as heat cost allocators, for our various metering activities. As of September 2023, there were 56.4
million submetering devices (66.7 million in total, including smoke detectors) installed in more than 13
million residential units in multi-unit residential or commercial buildings. In case of incorrect readings,
due to defective or incorrectly installed devices or incorrect billing due to process errors, we reimburse
customers using these devices. For example, we recently discovered deficiencies due to approximately
35,000 uncalibrated meters in Austria and we may discover further such deficiencies in any of our
markets, including as a result of inquiries to this end by competent authorities. In addition, defective or
incorrectly installed metering devices or incorrect readings or billing errors may violate statutory
requirements or our contractual obligations.

In addition, defects in smoke detectors, the incorrect installation or servicing of these detectors by us or
our installation or service partners and flaws in relation to customer specifications involve significant
risks for personal injury and property damage which could result in us being liable for defects or
insufficient services. As regards smoke detectors and the multi-sensor device, we do not manufacture
such devices but procure them from third parties. Nevertheless, a failure to properly install or render
the agreed services for these devices, or defects of the devices, may potentially lead to damage to human
life and limb which would severely adversely affect our reputation. For example, recently some of the
smoke detectors we procured from our supplier emitted signal noises on levels lower than specified in
technical standards. As a consequence, substantial testing and investigations had to be conducted to
determine whether the affected devices had to be exchanged (which was not the case).

As a result, we may be exposed to damage compensation claims by our customers or third parties or
possibly be obligated to pay administrative fines. In addition, affected devices might be recalled or must
be reinstalled, and we may not be able to pass this cost on to our suppliers. Any of these factors could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, our reputation
and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Furthermore, in our energy contracting business, we operate more than 300 combined heat and power
(“CHP”) units. Those heat and power units may fail to function properly. Other risks associated with
the operation of these units are accidents such as the occurrence of fires (for example due to leaks or
errors in the handling of fuels) and explosions (for example as a result of high-pressure components and
the presence of combustion materials), or leakage of hot water (for example in connection with
improperly fitted material), or the wear and tear of a unit. As the operator of these units, we may be
liable under general rules of civil liability for damages caused in the course of their operation, as well
as damages caused by a functional failure of any of these units. Under certain circumstances we may
be held strictly liable for damages, in particular for damages to individuals, property, water and soil,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations
and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees if
we were required to pay damages.

**_We are exposed to the risk of defects or security vulnerabilities of our products, or other reasons for_**
**_which they do not meet customers’ requirements. The materialization of such risks may harm our_**
**_reputation and lead to the incurrence of warranty claims of our customers, which could adversely_**
**_affect our business and financial condition._**

We rent or sell many products that must meet demanding quality standards and product specifications
that are either customary in the market, self-imposed or agreed with customers. Our products are subject
to various technical risks over their lifecycle. Design defects and quality flaws in our products may
expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business. For example, submetering and data
collection equipment fitted with radio transmitters may be exposed to hacker attacks and security
vulnerabilities may surface. This also applies to the smoke detectors we sell or rent and our multi-sensor


-----

device which we expect to launch in the course of this year. Each of these could be subject to particular
interest by hackers due to their function as a safety device rather than a metering device.

To the extent the products we sell or rent could have production defects or security vulnerabilities, we
may have to discontinue production of the relevant devices until the cause of the error in the product is
identified and a remedy is found. In the case of products already delivered and installed, accurate
consumption-based submetering for the affected customers might not be possible in the time prior to
the discovery and the remedying of such a defect. If, for example, a submetering and data collection
device is defective for a long period of time and has to be replaced, a customer might be liable for
damages if the end-user has paid too much or too little over this time period or if it can no longer be
determined how the costs are to be allocated to individual tenants. In addition, our customers may be in
violation of certain laws in case of the use of a defective product, such as the German Heating Cost
Ordinance. This may adversely affect our reputation and could lead to liability claims by our customers.
Flaws in the submetering and data collection equipment could also impair the market acceptance of our
other products and services and thus reduce revenue.

Each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees.

**_If we are unable to implement our transformative initiatives successfully, we might fail to realize our_**
**_management plan._**

The implementation of our corporate strategy is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions,
including assumptions relating to the implementation of our various transformative initiatives,
organized under our value creation program ENERGIZE-T.

In order to remain competitive in our markets and support our financial performance, we launched our
comprehensive value creation program ENERGIZE-T in 2018. We organize all our major initiatives
underpinning our management plan under this value creation program. ENERGIZE-T comprises various
strategic initiatives, including initiatives regarding the improvement of our operational and commercial
processes, digitalization (such as the development of our One Digital Platform and the full digitalization
of our submetering infrastructure), ways to achieve growth in new products and services, further steps
in our M&A activities, as well as measures around cultural transformation within our Group with a
focus on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters. We closely monitor the progress of
our initiatives under this program.

However, the expected benefits of any or all individual transformative initiatives under the ENERGIZE_T program may not be achieved within the time frame we currently anticipate or at all. Also, the process_
efficiencies we anticipate regarding the operational initiatives are based on our own current estimates
and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions are uncertain and subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties which we are not able to predict, and which are beyond our
control.

If the implementation of any or all of our major transformative initiatives under our value creation
program ENERGIZE-T, are not successful and the targeted efficiency gains cannot be realized fully or
at all, our financial performance may not improve as expected. As a result, our financial condition could
be materially adversely affected.

**_From time to time, property management companies seek to in-source the metering and billing of_**
**_heat and water consumption. This could lead to a loss of customers and adversely affect our market_**
**_share and, consequently, our results of operations._**

In the past, large property management companies have, and may continue to, in-source the metering
or billing of heat and water consumption rather than engaging energy service providers for these


-----

services. These initiatives could be driven by the desire to control or lower the costs associated with our
services, having superior control over data and security, or integrating these processes with their own
software and thereby streamlining operations. For example, in recent years, one of our customers with
over 300,000 residential units, in-sourced the metering and billing of heat and water consumption as
part of an overall strategy to in-source all external services, which did not materially impact our
business. Using this approach, property management companies could refrain from or discontinue the
use of our cost allocation services. Especially in economic downturns or in times of strained property
markets as currently experienced in our markets, we view this trend as more pronounced, because
property management companies may look for ways to reduce layoffs or to generate earnings
themselves. While we noticed that the trend towards self-billing has mostly not established itself also
due to customers increasingly recognizing the complexity of consumption-based billing and the
requirements for digitalization and data protection, we cannot exclude that this trend may reassert itself
in any of our markets in the future.

Such development may lead to a loss of customers and in turn could reduce our market share and
revenues and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Legal and regulatory disputes pose a risk of substantial penalties or damages, as well as additional_**
**_costs that we may be required to pay and could further harm our reputation._**

Legal actions and claims involving our Group companies typically arise in the ordinary course of our
business, and hence we are, and likely will be in the future, involved in legal and civil, tax, and
regulatory proceedings to which we are a party or in which we are otherwise involved. Our business is
subject to domestic and foreign laws and regulations, many of which include legal and administrative
standards subject to interpretation. The outcome of these proceedings is uncertain. For example, we
recently faced claims related to price escalation clauses used in general terms and conditions in some
of our contracts for energy contracting.

Some of the proceedings we are currently involved in (or proceedings in which we may become
involved), if adversely resolved, could result in an obligation for us to pay penalties or damages. We
may therefore incur related losses which may not be covered by our insurance policies. Furthermore,
such payments could exceed provisions we made for losses related to legal proceedings.

In addition, some of these proceedings, as well as proceedings involving members of our senior
management in their personal capacity, may divert attention from our senior management or result in
significant costs. Furthermore, our involvement, or the involvement of members of our senior
management in legal, civil, tax, regulatory, competition, criminal and other proceedings may harm our
reputation. We cannot assure you what the ultimate outcome of any particular proceeding will be, and
a negative outcome in the form of a judgement for payment of damages or a fine could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are subject to competition and antitrust laws, which may subject us to liability and hinder our_**
**_business strategy._**

Our business is subject to applicable competition and antitrust laws, rules, and regulations. These laws
are designed to preserve free and open competition in the marketplace in order to enhance
competitiveness and economic efficiency and to protect consumers. We have been in the past, and may
in the future become, subject to investigations and proceedings by national and supranational
competition and antitrust authorities for alleged infringements of competition or antitrust laws. Such
investigations or proceedings may be initiated either by competent authorities, or as a result of
complaint proceedings initiated by customers. For example, we currently are involved in an
investigation conducted by the competition authority in North Rhine-Westphalia that was initiated by a
third-party in relation to our pricing clauses. Furthermore, we were subject to a competition proceeding


-----

in Austria regarding a potential illegal exchange of information and agreements on prices and conditions
with competitors in violation of antitrust law between July 2004 and February 2019. As of the date of
this Offering Memorandum, no fines were imposed in connection with this proceeding. However, we
are currently in negotiations with certain of our customers regarding potential claims for damages and
additional claims may be filed in the future. Such investigations and proceedings may require
considerable time and resources and may result in adverse publicity, irrespective of the investigation’s
ultimate outcome. Actual infringements of competition or antitrust laws could result in fines and other
liabilities (including claims for damages), which could be significant, and harm our reputation and
competitive position, including by restricting our ability to tender for services to public sector landlords.

We may also become subject to other inquiries and actions by the competent competition authorities.
For example, in May 2017, the German Federal Cartel Office published its final report on its sector
inquiry into the German market for heating and water submetering, initiated in July 2015. The report
identifies certain deficits of the competitive process and proposes various measures in order to promote
competition in the heating and water cost allocation market, including improving the interoperability of
meters, the standardization of calibration periods and the service life of meters, and improved
transparency for tenants. It is possible that these proposals will ultimately result in regulation
detrimental to our business environment. The German legislator has now addressed most of the
proposed measures. However, we cannot rule out that additional legislative measures may be enacted
in the future. For example, the eleventh amendment to the German Competition Act (Gesetz gegen
_Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen) that came into effect in 2023 significantly expands the powers of the_
Federal Cartel Office. It reduces the maximum length of a standard sector inquiry to 18 months and
empowers the Federal Cartel Office to directly intervene following its conclusion. Since the law does
not include definitive guidance as to what constitutes a “restriction or distortion of competition,” any
economic sector with stable and/or oligopolistic market conditions may be subject to increased sector
inquiries and potential interventions. It remains to be seen whether in light of the past sector inquiry the
submetering sector would be an immediately obvious target for such a sector inquiry again.

In addition, competition and antitrust laws may also restrict our ability to make acquisitions, enter into
joint ventures and otherwise implement our business strategy. As a result of any of the foregoing,
detrimental effects from antitrust scrutiny may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Finally, some of the agreements, for example exclusivity agreements, that we conclude with our
suppliers and distributors, or sales representatives may contain clauses that may be found to be not in
full compliance with applicable competition and antitrust laws. If any such clauses were challenged by
a customer or declared void by courts or legislation of the jurisdictions in which we operate, fines could
be imposed on us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees.

**_Restrictions on our customers’ ability to allocate the costs of our services to their tenants may_**
**_discourage them from utilizing our services and thus adversely affect our results of operation. In_**
**_addition, price adjustment provisions in our customer contracts may be held invalid by courts._**

In Germany, where we generated 75.7% of our revenues in the twelve months ended December 31,
2023, according to Section 556c of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, the “BGB”), a
landlord is entitled to implement even without the tenant’s consent an energy contracting system and to
allocate the costs related to energy contracting to tenants, if (i) the tenants are contractually obliged to
bear the costs of heating or hot water, (ii) heat is delivered in a more efficient way than before (either
by new installation by the contractor or by a heat energy network) and (iii) the energy contracting
solution is cost neutral for the tenant. If the annual efficiency rate of an existing installation is 80% or
more, it is sufficient that the energy contractor improves the efficiency of the operation of the energy
delivery (rather than complying with clause (ii) above). The cost neutrality is determined in a calculation
formula set forth in the German Heat Delivery Ordinance (Wärmelieferverordnung, the “WärmeLV”).


-----

According to Sections 8-10 WärmeLV, cost neutrality would be achieved if the expected annual costs
of the energy contracting solution to the tenants would not have exceeded the average heating and hot
water costs paid by the tenants in the last three years (calculated based on the volume utilized in those
last three years and prices of the last year, taking into account price adjustments). The above rules are
mandatory for residential lease agreements in the sense that deviations therefrom, such as in the form
of agreements that are to the detriment of residential tenants are invalid. These rules apply to all
situations where a lease agreement is in place and the contracting system has been, or is, implemented
at any time since July 1, 2013, during the lifetime of an existing lease agreement. If contracting has
been implemented contrary to the statute, the landlord can, accordingly, only pass on the costs for heat
and warm water but not the additional costs of the contractor.

The requirements of Section 556c of the BGB can significantly affect a landlord’s ability to pass on
contracting costs to tenants and as a result reduce the landlord’s willingness to introduce energy
contracting. This could have a material adverse effect on our product and service offering in this regard,
and we have in this context experienced an adverse effect on our ability to win new business related to
existing buildings. Moreover, we cannot exclude additional changes to the statutory provisions or court
rulings interpreting such provisions to the detriment of landlords, which could further restrict the ability
of landlords to allocate costs for investments in our innovative technologies and energy contracting to
tenants, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We develop intellectual property for our business, and we may not be able to protect our intellectual_**
**_property to an adequate degree. A failure to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect_**
**_our market position and revenues._**

Our business requires us to utilize our technical knowledge. To protect our intellectual property, we
have patents, utility models, other protective rights, and applications for such rights. For example, we
currently own more than 80 patents, mainly in Europe, with an additional more than 20 applications for
patent pending. Patented key inventions are used in our metering devices with radio transmission, in
the water meter radio module (e.g., leakage detection, manipulation detection, rotation detection), for
manipulation protection (seal of heat cost allocator and securing local communication interface with
authentication codes), and in systems and processes for reducing the energy consumption in buildings.
The issuance of patents does not necessarily mean that they are valid or that potential patent claims will
be enforceable to the required or desired extent. Furthermore, not all of our patent applications may
mature into granted patents. Also, our existing patents may be successfully challenged, revoked, or
circumvented in the future.

Moreover, in the case of new technologies, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for all
these new technologies in all countries where we deem this useful or necessary and have accordingly
applied or intend to apply for patents. Furthermore, it is possible that our patents and protective rights
might be infringed by third parties. Where legally possible and considered commercially viable, we will
continue to seek the protection of patents, trademarks, and other IP rights, however, it might be
impossible for us to prevent or remedy such infringement.

In addition, there can be no assurance that our patents and similar rights will provide us with a
significant advantage over our competitors as they could independently develop technology that may
prove to be comparable with or superior to our technology. Furthermore, inadequate protection of our
intellectual property may result in the inability to take profitable advantage of technological advances
that have been achieved. Likewise, competitors might manufacture or market products that are similar
to the products developed by us in collaboration with our partners.

A failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our market positions and lead to
revenue declines that could have a negative impact on our profitability and future prospects and have a


-----

material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our competitive position could be impaired if our operating and trade secrets cannot be adequately_**
**_safeguarded._**

Our competitive position is dependent on the safeguarding of our proprietary, non-publicly available
know-how against use by third parties, such as our know-how in the fields of information technology
(“IT”), software, and cloud connectivity. Currently, large parts of our operating and trade secrets are
not protected by patents because any patent application would require us to publish our related knowhow, and in some instances trade secrets may not be protected by patents under applicable laws. Our
trade secrets and unregistered property rights do not afford the same level of protection as patents. For
example, we document various business workflows in manuals that are made available to companies
belonging to our Group, but also to subcontractors working for us. Although we endeavor to safeguard
our extensive operating and trade secrets comprehensively by means of confidentiality agreements, for
example with our consultants and business partners, including across borders, these agreements may be
breached. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that a confidentiality agreement is entered into with
every person who learns of our operating and trade secrets and thus that comprehensive protection can
be ensured.

Moreover, copyright laws offer only limited protection. Third parties may infringe protected legal
positions or attempt to obtain our proprietary know-how despite our protective measures. This could
cause us to enter into protracted and costly litigation. In addition, if any such disputes are resolved
against us, our competitors could introduce products replicating the design or features of our own
products.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our measures to safeguard our own intellectual property
rights will successfully prevent the development and design of products or technologies by competitors
that are similar to our products or that could enter into competition with them. If our operating and trade
secrets become known to competitors, this could have a negative impact on our competitive position,
result in a decline in revenue and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations,
financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We might infringe the intellectual property of third parties which may prevent us from selling our_**
**_products or services and could result in costs. We are exposed to the risk of underlying licenses not_**
**_being extended. In such cases, we would have to find replacements which would result in a disruption_**
**_of our operations and could adversely affect our business and financial results._**

It is possible that we might infringe patents or other protective rights of third parties since our
competitors also apply for patents for inventions and frequently receive patent protection. For example,
we are involved in objection proceedings against some of our competitors’ patents where we cannot
exclude the possibility of infringement by certain of our technologies. If such infringements should
occur, we would be prevented from using the respective technologies in the relevant countries where
protective rights were granted.

In such cases, we might be unable to market, rent or sell our products or products manufactured for us
that use such technologies, and we could potentially be forced to purchase licenses or may have to
change the design, functionalities and technologies used in devices, or change the manufacturing
processes. However, there can be no assurance that we will obtain the licenses necessary for our
business success to the extent required and under reasonable terms. Moreover, there is no certainty that
existing licenses will continue to be maintained to the extent necessary. Further, we could be obligated
to pay damages. Even if we were successful in any such litigation, this could be time-consuming and
costly and place considerable demands on our management’s attention. Regardless of the outcome of
such litigation, the negative external impact of litigation concerning the infringement of intellectual


-----

property could deter customers from collaborating with us or have a negative impact on such a
collaboration, merely on account of the risks associated with such litigation.

The suspension, restriction or interruption of the delivery, sale, or production by suppliers as a result of
a protective rights infringement or the loss of a license, the subsequent purchase of a corresponding
license, or litigation in this regard may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may fail to develop attractive products and services, and our competitors may develop devices or_**
**_technologies and artificial intelligence solutions superior to our offering which could result in a loss_**
**_of market share, and our revenues could be adversely affected._**

We continually aim to improve our submetering technology and data collection equipment and to
develop new products and solutions that are essential to expand our market-leading position as an
energy services provider. A major objective of these efforts is to reduce our costs for submetering and
data collection equipment by redesigning them to take advantage of new technology, such as modular
technology, so that they can be produced more cost efficiently. Competitors may develop and market
submetering and data collection equipment, submetering technologies or offer services that are superior
to our products or services as they may be more convenient to use for customers, provide better results
for customers, or such products and services could be less expensive compared to our product and
service offerings. For example, our competitors may develop AI and machine learning technologies that
could be superior to our technologies in the field of remote reading and plausibility tests involved in
our billing processes or our competitors may have more extensive know-how on the development of
technologies using AI. Furthermore, while we originally were one of only a few companies offering
smoke detectors with remote function control, the majority of our competitors have now developed
similar products. If our competitors develop and market offerings that are superior to ours, this may
result in a loss of market share and ultimately adversely affect our results of operations and thus on our
ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Recent technological advances in AI and machine learning technology pose risks to us. Machine
learning technology is generally highly reliant on the collection and analysis of large amounts of data,
and it is not possible or practicable to incorporate all relevant data into the model that machine learning
technology utilizes to operate. Certain data in such models will inevitably contain a degree of inaccuracy
and error and could otherwise be inadequate or flawed, which would be likely to degrade the
effectiveness of machine learning technology. To the extent we are exposed to the risks of machine
learning technology use (such as in connection with our digital heat chain offering) any such
inaccuracies or errors could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operation and thus
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

The energy cost crisis as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022
(“Russia-Ukraine War”) as well as regulatory changes have led to an increased development speed in
our markets. These events have raised awareness of energy costs and consumption among our customers
and their tenants, driving demand and innovation for energy-efficient solutions. Even though we were
able to increase our development speed accordingly, our competitors might be able to develop and
market new technologies more quickly, and we may not be able to keep pace with the increasing
development speed in our markets, including due to delays in the development and production of our
own products. The launch of our multi-sensor device in the course of 2024 could be delayed, for
example should we not be able to obtain all required certifications in time. We might also face delays
in case the partners with whom we cooperate for the development experience operational or financial
difficulties, or due to supply delays or stoppages. Our competitive position could be further exacerbated
should our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, or other resources.

Competition may result in more advanced technology or products, or services of equivalent quality
being offered at a lower cost. Based on the proposition of more advanced technology or more favorable


-----

pricing, current or potential customers could decide to switch away from our products and services to
or contract with our competitors, which would have a negative impact on our market shares and our
competitive position. In addition, we may have to make significant investments to upgrade our products
and services with more advanced technology which may adversely affect our financial condition and
thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are highly dependent on the error-free functioning of our IT and communications systems for_**
**_the delivery of our services. Disruptions or deficiencies in our IT systems could adversely affect our_**
**_business operations, and price increases related to our IT and communications systems may_**
**_adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

We operate around 1,500 servers which are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption. Our
business activities rely heavily on functioning of efficient and modern centralized IT hardware and
software systems and networks to support business processes, as well as internal and external
communications. These systems and networks include, in particular, our proprietary billing software
HZ/3 which forms a key part of transactional data processing. Data transfer from the buildings in which
we offer our services relies on our smart readers for remote reading to be installed in our customers’
buildings, and we collect and forward data for further management and analysis through our fully
automated Techem Fixed Network. We also rely on our digital customer service portal my.techem and
expect to rely even more on the functioning of this portal as our digitalization strategy progresses. In
addition, we have developed smartphone applications which are connected to our reading devices and
we aim to develop new applications.

Should any of these current or new systems or hardware be deficient or disrupted and thereby experience
failures and become unavailable or inaccessible, this could adversely affect our business as it could lead
to a reduced or lost ability for our business operations. Furthermore, our IT and communications
systems are also vulnerable to natural disasters, industrial accidents, blackouts, criminal activity,
technological changes or events, terrorism, or military action (including the Russia-Ukraine War), as
well as other events beyond our control, including as a result of human error and other calamities.
Adverse weather conditions, earthquakes, fires, telecommunications failures, breakage of land or
submarine transmission cables, or similar events may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns,
system failures, technology platform failures or internet failures. For example, a malfunction of the
submarine cable connecting our main data center, which is located in Gothenburg (Sweden), with our
IT systems for any reasons, including incidents in the Baltic Sea, could in turn cause the loss or
corruption of data or malfunctions of our systems or hardware. Disruptions or deficiencies of our IT
systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct our operations and delay or prevent us from
providing our digital services. This may result in warranty claims of our customers and hence adversely
affect our financial condition.

We outsource most of our IT infrastructure (such as servers and network services) to HCL GmbH, an
external data center provider with whom we entered into various service level agreements and who
provides us with support in connection with the planning, development, provision, operation,
maintenance regarding our information and communication services. We have also entered into a
cooperation with Microsoft’s Azure as our cloud software and hardware provider as we aim to use cloud
technology to ensure competitiveness of our digital services in the future. As a result, we are dependent
on these and any of our other external providers adhering to such agreements and being capable of
providing the agreed services such as the cloud. Furthermore, we rely on the security measures our
external providers have put in place and the reliability of the external providers’ operations. While our
partners ability to comply with data protection laws is part of our selection process, some of our
customers have questioned, and may continue to question, the compliance by the service providers we
cooperate with when outsourcing our IT infrastructure as regards data protection law compliance.

An extended outage in a data center or telecommunications network we rely on, or a similar event could
lead to an extended unanticipated interruption of services and could result in delayed data and cost
collection and as a result we would not be able to render certain of our data driven services. It could


-----

furthermore result in loss of data, claims for damages by our customers and ultimately the loss of
business should customers cease to trust in our ability to operate reliably. Damages or interruptions to
our own or outsourced IT infrastructure could result from various events outside of our control, and our
IT disaster recovery system may not be sufficient. The disaster recovery arrangements we have put in
place, have not been tested during actual disasters or similar events and may not effectively permit us
to continue to run our business in the event of any problems with respect to the data that we use which
may result in a loss of business and adversely affect our financial condition.

As we rely significantly on third partners for the provision of these IT services, substantial increases in
the prices of such service providers generally also lead to increases in the prices they charge us for their
services. As a result, if such prices increase significantly or if we are required to find alternative
suppliers, our costs to procure these services may increase significantly and we may not be able to pass
these increased costs along to our customers. To the extent that we are unable to pass along to our
customers such price increases, our cost base and hence our financial condition and results of operations
may be adversely affected.

The realization of any risks related to our IT system and network could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to the risk of cyberattacks which could cause significant harm to our operations and_**
**_therefore adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations._**

We bundle our cloud-based infrastructure, digital infrastructure in properties, and domain expertise in
our One Digital Platform. This platform serves as key enabler for most of our offerings as it permits
seamless connectivity of our devices in buildings. Furthermore, our Techem Fixed Network is the
digital infrastructure that connects our devices in a property. As a digitally driven business with a
digitalized asset base, our IT systems therefore form an integral part of the functionality of our business
as they ensure the security of the data on our One Digital Platform and data that otherwise supports
many of our products and services. Our IT systems are subject to the risk of computer viruses or other
malicious codes, unauthorized access, or cyberattacks from a variety of sources, including directly,
through a vendor, customer, or other business partner with access to our IT systems, or through code
embedded in a program or application we run on our IT systems. In particular, an increased number of
cyberattacks continues to put a focus on information security and the protection of personal data. As a
result, a generally heightened risk environment has emerged for companies like ours that deal with
highly sensitive data, some of which have been severely disrupted by cyber-attacks. For example, in
2022 a cyberattack was carried out specifically targeting one of our competitors.

We currently observe more than one million unauthorized attempts per months to access our IT systems.
Recently, we counted approximately two million malicious login attempts and received approximately
20,000 phishing emails within one month. Our preventive measures to reduce the risk of cyber incidents
and protect our IT environment may be insufficient and we may experience break-ins, cyberattacks, or
other security breaches to our systems. A successful cyberattack would have significant adverse effects
on our business activities as it would disrupt our business operations and also affect our internal and
external communication. It could also lead to a temporary or permanent functionality failure of our
metering and detection devices or prevent us from accessing our systems in which metering data is
stored and billing is carried out. As a result, we could lose some or all of this data and may not be able
to create accurate bills. Any such attack may further expose us to risks relating to the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of data and may lead to severe damage to our reputation and image. Due to
the nature of evolving IT systems and cyber security landscape in light of the diverse and increasingly
complex breaches, we cannot predict the method or outcome of every potential cyber incident, but the
realization of such risk could have a material adverse effect on our operations as well as our financial
condition, as we do not have insurance coverage for damages related to cyber-security attacks.


-----

**_Failure to securely attain and keep the decryption keys required for an increasing number of our_**
**_submeters could have a negative impact on our operations._**

All radio equipped submeters newly installed within the EU which use radio encryption technology
must comply with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 27 April 2016, on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of
personal data and on the free movement of such data, as amended (“GDPR”). In order to use the data
for providing services to our customers a reliable decryption process is required that includes secure
transmission and storage of keys. The loss of keys without the ability to restore them, leads to an
extended unanticipated interruption of services and could result in an inability to use data, and therefore
result in claims for damages by our customers, and ultimately the loss of business from these customers.

Also, if keys are not securely held and are leaked by accident or due to a cyberattack or an IT
malfunction, the transmitted data (such as reading values) could be compromised, also leading to claims
for damages by our customers and ultimately loss of business and reputation as our customers may
doubt the integrity of our products and services.

This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations
and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our Techem Fixed Network reading systems depend on underlying systems and networks, the failure_**
**_of which could have a negative impact on our operations._**

Our Techem Fixed Network reading systems depend on underlying systems and networks, including
certificates to ensure secure communications, and telecommunications networks based on 3rd
Generation Partnership Project standards such as General Packet Radio Service (“GPRS”). For our
Techem Fixed Network reading systems secure communication is essential. For that purpose,
certificates are used that have an expiration date. Once the expiration date has been reached,
communication via mobile network is no longer possible. A technician is then required to exchange or
update the device. Meanwhile, we would be unable to remotely read our submeters, which could result
in a delay in readings or could require us to read the meters manually. Similarly, our remote reading
system Techem Smart which is based on the technology of our radio frequency system relies on the
availability of telecommunication networks supporting GPRS, and the discontinuation of GPRS without
sufficient notice could have a negative impact on our operations as our services would be delayed or
interrupted in the short term. Such delays or interruptions of our operations may lead to claims for
damages by our customers, and ultimately the loss of business and could thus affect our ability to fulfill
our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Some of our submeters use radio technology that requires the use of radio frequencies subject to_**
**_regulatory oversight. Failure to attain or maintain access to radio frequencies could have a negative_**
**_impact on our operations._**

We use radio technology in our submeters, smart readers and smoke detectors as they allow for wireless
communication and require a lower level of maintenance compared to wired devices. In most countries
where we operate, including Germany, radio frequencies are subject to regulatory oversight. We are
required to maintain valid permits to use radio frequencies, which we need in order to use the radio
technology in our radio-enabled devices.

The regulations relating to radio frequencies are subject to change. In case of such changes, or if we are
unable to obtain or maintain our permits, our ability to use radio technology could be adversely affected.
For example, if we were unable to use a specific radio frequency in a specific jurisdiction, we would be
unable to remotely read our submeters, which could result in a delay in readings or could require us to
read the meters manually which could lead to liability claims by our customers and as a result, adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We collect and process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate_**
**_law and could adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to data protection legislation (including the GDPR) because we collect, store, and use
personal data in the ordinary course of our business operations, especially with regard to cost allocation
and the provision of billing services in relation to heat and water consumption to our customers.
Furthermore, companies which we have acquired and might acquire in the future could also be subject
to such legislation. Non-compliance or technical defects resulting in a leak, or the misuse of such data
could result in damage to our reputation and otherwise harm our business.

The GDPR, which came into effect on May 25, 2018 and was immediately binding across all Member
States of the EU, is a privacy regime regarding the protection of natural persons in relation to the
processing of personal data and the free movement of such data. The GDPR obligates EU-based
companies or companies that process personal data about EU subjects (either as “data controllers” or as
“data processors”) to comply with a large number of obligations, which relate for example to (i) the
processing of personal data including transparency, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation,
security and confidentiality, (ii) the ability of the controller to demonstrate compliance with such
principles (accountability), (iii) the obligation to identify a legal basis before the processing and (iv) the
rights of data subjects, such as, among others, transparency, a right of access, the right to rectification
and the right to erasure. The GDPR obligates companies to implement a number of formal processes
and policies to review and document the privacy implications of the development, acquisition, or use
of all new products, technologies or types of data. Non-compliance may be met with significant
penalties including fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or €20 million (whichever is
higher), depending on the type and severity of the breach. The fine may be imposed instead of, or in
addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease
processing). Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our
cost of doing business, and the failure to comply with these laws could subject us to significant fines
and sanctions.

It is also possible that future changes to the applicable legal framework may lead to more strict data
protection requirements. Such changes may especially occur in connection with radio-enabled devices
and related services and may involve specific encryption and signature requirements. Independent of
changes in the law, our customers may demand specific data protection measures going beyond those
legally required to be applied to the submetering of water and heating. In these cases, we would have
to adapt our products and services to these specific requirements. This may entail complex technical
changes and significant investments. In the past, some of our customers have faced enquiries from their
respective state data protection commissioners regarding our radio-enabled devices, data collection and
the way consumption data is transmitted via radio. If such enquiries result in a finding that we did not
comply with applicable data protection legislation we could be forced to modify the functionality of our
radio-enabled devices. In addition, we do not currently have specific data security insurance coverage
and we cannot guarantee that our general liability insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all or
any liabilities in the event of a breach of our data security systems. Should one or more of these risks
materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operation and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We are subject to sustainability regulation and have set ourselves sustainability targets. Evolving_**
**_regulation could result in additional costs. An actual or perceived deterioration of our sustainability_**
**_profile could adversely harm our reputation and inhibit our ability to raise capital and hence_**
**_adversely affect our financial profile._**

The management of our ESG dimension is expected to drive impact on our success as a business as it
will enable us to identify opportunities and risks at a relatively early stage. In particular, we have set
ourselves specific ESG targets, such as our target to achieve 35% women in management positions by
the end of the financial year 2025, and determined concrete performance indicators around the areas


-----

“For the Climate & the Environment,” “For the Individual & the Community,” and “For Ethical
Business Behaviour.” Through these targets and indicators, we aim at ensuring the effective
implementation of our ESG strategy. Our ongoing efforts to achieve our ESG goals may result in
increased costs. Standards regarding ESG could change and become more onerous and costly for us to
meet. Evolving data, methods, research and reporting requirements, including science-based
assessments, could undermine or refute claims and beliefs that we have made in reliance on current
data, research and reporting requirements which could result in additional costs or negative market
perception.

**_We are dependent on successfully collaborating with third parties to develop our products, install our_**
**_devices and provide certain related services. If our collaborations are terminated or do not succeed_**
**_for other reasons, this could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

We offer a number of services in collaboration with companies that do business in related industries as
well as other suppliers and service providers. For example, for our water testing business we have
established a cooperation with SGS Fresenius, an independent provider of laboratory services.
Furthermore, we have set up collaborations for the development of certain devices which we plan to
offer, such as our multi-sensor device which we expect to launch in the course of 2024, as well as for
our electric vehicle charging business. As collaborations involve external third parties over which we
have no or limited control, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these arrangements,
for example due to a shortfall of the quality of services provided by our partners, or a partner’s inability
to adhere to agreed deadlines. Hence, our ability to fully exploit the strategic potential of the products
and services that we offer through these collaborations could be impaired if we cease to agree with our
partners on strategy and implementation if our collaborators no longer provide their services at
competitive prices or with the desired quality or if they have financial difficulty or violate contractual
obligations.

Our collaborators or joint venture partners may, for economic, strategic, or other reasons beyond our
control, cease collaborating with us or have divergent views about business or strategy. As a result, we
may be forced to acquire the partner’s equity stake, which may adversely affect our financial condition,
or to end the collaboration or to find a new partner, which could delay or prevent us from providing our
services and hence adversely affect our strategy or our business and financial results.

There is also a risk that the transfer of know-how and trade secrets to partners in the context of joint
ventures and other collaborations could result in a drain of expertise from us. In particular, after a
potential separation from a joint venture or collaborator, there is no guarantee that the know-how or
trade secrets transferred to such partner will not be used by our partners or disclosed and used by third
parties, thereby adversely affecting our competitive position. Although most of our collaboration
agreements contain clauses that prohibit the use of know-how and trade secrets shared during the
collaborations outside of such a collaboration, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be
adhered to by the relevant counterparties. In such cases, the disclosure of our know-how or trade secrets
to our competitors could materially harm our market position and result in a loss of business which, in
turn, could adversely affect our financial results and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Besides collaboration for the development of devices, we also collaborate with third parties for the
installation of our devices and for the maintenance and services. The installation and servicing of our
devices is handled by third-party service providers. This is particularly relevant for us as more than half
of the installations are typically handled by third parties. To the extent that these installation partners
face a shortage of skilled labor, we may not be able to find a sufficient number of partners for some of
our products or in some or parts of our markets, or these partners may only be available to us at less
attractive terms. Even in situations where we manage to contract a sufficient number of installation or
service partners, their service may not meet our customers’ expectations. Although we aim to supervise
these third parties closely, we may experience deficiencies with regard to timeliness and quality of their
services due to various factors on their end such as their inability to hire and retain skilled personnel.


-----

To the extent the relevant third parties are unable to meet customer expectations or experience
difficulties in providing their services, our reputation and business and thus our ability to fulfill our
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may be adversely affected.

**_Supply chain problems with or price increases by major suppliers may delay or prevent the delivery_**
**_and installation of devices and other equipment or otherwise adversely affect our business and_**
**_financial results._**

Metering devices are the basis for our submetering and ancillary energy efficiency solutions, and we
also offer devices to meter heating consumption as well as devices to meter water and cooling
consumption. To this end, we rely on third party suppliers to develop, manufacture, and assemble our
devices. As such, we depend on the performance of our suppliers. Price increases by or supply problems
with any of our major suppliers could affect significant quantities of equipment which, under certain
circumstances, other suppliers may not be able to provide to us in a timely manner or at all. In particular,
we are susceptible to increases in our suppliers’ production costs. For example, we have recently
experienced increases in procurement costs, such as increasing prices for electronic components, and
energy costs, which impact production costs of our suppliers passed on to us. Many devices that are
relevant for our business have proprietary specifications and are produced exclusively for us, according
to our specifications. Should our suppliers fail to meet our specifications, standards, and requirements,
we may face quality issues regarding our devices. Further, supply shortages may prevent us from
complying with statutory calibration periods for our metering products, which could lead to potential
fines imposed on us. In addition, our brand and reputation are closely linked to our commitment to and
delivery of high-quality products and services. Hence, should suppliers fail to meet our standards and
requirements, our brand or reputation could be adversely affected.

Our or our suppliers’ ability to maintain adequate supplies of materials could be impacted by factors
outside of our control (e.g., as a consequence of armed conflicts, sanctions, pandemic-related
lockdowns, export control measures, the introduction of tariffs and/or lack of freight capacity). Since
August 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War, among other
reasons, many sectors globally have experienced a general shortage of raw materials and components
in addition to disruptions in national and international logistics systems as well as in the packaging
market. In addition to materials such as wood, metals, chemicals and plastics, the availability of
electronic components used in our metering devices and smoke detectors have been heavily affected by
supply chain shortages. Furthermore, price volatility and the threat of shortages of gas or other energy
related raw materials due to the unpredictability of the Russia-Ukraine War poses a significant risk. Our
business is further susceptible to a worsening of the relationship between China and Taiwan, as such a
development poses a significant risk of delays or disruptions in imports from China, which could
adversely affect supply chains.

In addition, we depend on third-party logistics providers for the shipping and distribution of our
products. Hence, we only have limited control over the handling of these products in the course of the
fulfillment process and the timing of deliveries. For example, we may experience shipping delays due
to, among other things, inclement weather, natural disasters, strikes, war or terrorism. We have observed
disruptions in international supply chains as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic which rendered some
of our third-party service providers unable to deliver our products in time or at all, and such disruptions
to logistics networks and capacity constraints have resulted in increases in freight costs which adversely
affected our cost of sales.

While we generally pursue a second or multiple source supply strategy for metering devices and other
equipment in the financial year ended September 30, 2023, we ordered certain devices in large quantities
from a single supplier. For example, we rely on Hager Safety Deutschland GmbH as a single source
supplier for the delivery of certain smoke detectors. Any such dependence on a single-source supplier
exposes us to risks, as, for example, our supplier may cease or reduce production or deliveries, raise
prices, or renegotiate terms, become insolvent or cease to do business. In any of these circumstances
we may be unable to locate a suitable replacement supplier on acceptable terms or on a timely basis.


-----

Failures on the part of a large supplier could adversely affect our performance during times of high
demand when inventory is low. In addition, the early termination or non-renewal of supply agreements
with key suppliers could cause a delay in the delivery and installation of devices and other equipment,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. If one of our material suppliers were to terminate its agreement with us, we may not be able
to identify supply alternatives in a timely manner or at all.

Price increases and supply delays or failures could have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver
our products and services to customers in time or at all, increase our cost base and therefore affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may not be able to successfully assert warranty claims against the suppliers of our metering_**
**_devices or other equipment. Any such cases would result in the occurrence of additional costs which_**
**_could negatively impact our financial position and have a material effect on our results of operations._**

The agreements with our suppliers usually provide for warranty claims in the event of defective devices.
Generally, the supply agreements contain an obligation to replace defective devices and reimburse the
costs incurred in handling the repair as well as an obligation of the suppliers to hold us harmless with
regard to product liability claims. However, in some cases, liability claims against our suppliers are
limited to foreseeable typical damages. The suppliers’ liability for further damages is limited either
directly to a certain amount or to the amount of the claims to which the supplier is entitled under its
business liability insurance. In some cases, the underlying agreement provides for a liability cap limiting
the extent to which we are able to claim damages. Therefore, if defects in individual devices exist or,
more importantly, if production or design flaws exist, there is a risk that we will incur losses in an
amount that we will not be able to claim either in full or at all in the form of warranty claims against
our suppliers.

We also face a risk of consequential losses, such as damages in connection with billing errors and the
loss of reputation due to negative publicity regarding quality or safety issues. This could reduce
acceptance of and demand for our products and offerings, result in early cancellations of customer
contracts or loss of customers and/or harm our ability to successfully launch and market our products
in the future. Suppliers may also contest any warranty claims, and we may have to make significant
expenditures and invest management time and attention to pursue warranty claims. Our suppliers may
also experience financial difficulties, making recovery under warranty claims less likely.

An inability to hold ourselves harmless for the acts or omissions of our suppliers and/or against our
suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Our customer service or billing processes may not be perceived as adequate or satisfactory by our_**
**_customers, which could result in increased customer churn and adversely affect our business._**

Our success is driven by, among other factors, customer satisfaction. We track our customer churn ratio
to measure customer satisfaction, which we calculate by comparing the churn rate based on the number
of cancellations of our devices that become effective within a financial year to the number of active
devices at the beginning of the relevant financial year. By September 2023, our overall customer churn
rate was 2%.

However, we may not be able to maintain our customer churn rate at this level. Our customer service
operations handle a significant number of customer contacts. Customer satisfaction depends, in
particular, on the effectiveness of our customer service, in particular our ability to deal with complaints
in a timely and satisfactory manner. Should we induce errors in the preparation of customer bills, fail
to solve customer problems in a fast and efficient way or fail to provide customers with the general


-----

level and type of service they expect, for example as we are looking to introduce automated customer
service processes in the future, this could negatively affect customer satisfaction levels, which could
damage our reputation and contribute to increased customer churn. This could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Damage to our reputation or increased churn could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are dependent on our senior management as well as the hiring and retention of key employees_**
**_and may face shortages of skilled labor which could slow growth and adversely affect our business,_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

Competition for talented personnel in our industry remains intense and our business success and future
development depends significantly on our ability to hire and retain management members, qualified
executives, and other key employees and rely on these persons to implement and further promote our
strategy. In particular, we are reliant on trained personnel in the areas of engineering, IT development
and data science personnel. Our business activities and expansion could be significantly jeopardized if
we had to continue without the services of one or more members of our senior team, including our
management board (the “Management Board”) or if we were to lose key employees, all of which could
have a material adverse effect on our market position and prospects. Furthermore, we could lose
considerable expertise and access thereto could be gained by competitors.

We try to retain the commitment of our qualified executives and key employees in part through
performance-based remuneration systems. Even with attractive compensation packages, there is no
guarantee that we will be successful in retaining these executives and the employees in key positions or
in attracting new employees with corresponding qualifications. Measures to reduce costs as a result of
the implementation of our value creation program ENERGIZE-T may impact employee morale.

Furthermore, as our business involves installation of our devices, we also depend upon the ability to
attract, motivate, and retain a skilled workforce. From time to time, we may experience a shortage of
skilled labor in our markets. We have recently experienced such shortages of employees involved in
installation in Germany. A shortage of skilled labor may make it increasingly difficult and expensive to
attract, train and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, which could disrupt
our ability install and service our devices adversely impact some or all of our operations. Furthermore,
competition for qualified employees, particularly in markets where such shortages exist, could require
us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher personnel costs which represent one of our most
significant cost items. A failure to attract and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect our
ability to operate and hence have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and results of
operations.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Advanced building technologies and associated regulation as well as new heating technologies_**
**_expose us to developments which could significantly reduce demand for our devices or services and_**
**_thus adversely affect our results of operations._**

With an increase in energy awareness and new technology, particularly in light of the energy crisis as a
result of the Russia-Ukraine War as well as increased consumer focus on energy efficiency and the shift
to green and renewable energy sources, advanced building standards such as the passive house standard
from the “International Passive House Association” have developed. Buildings that meet the passive
house standard consume so little energy that submetering is no longer economical. Therefore, buildings
built in Germany that meet the passive house standard are exempt from regulatory requirements for


-----

consumption-based metering and billing of heat and hot water consumption. Demand for our cost
allocation services may be affected if the number of new and existing buildings meeting such a standard
begins to increase or if construction pursuant to the passive house standard becomes a legal requirement.
Similar effects may impact our business outside Germany, especially in countries with high new
construction and modernization levels as new construction would not use cost allocation and demand
for our services would phase out, as we have experienced in Switzerland with regards to heat
submetering in newly constructed structures. Such trends could significantly reduce demand for our
devices or services and thus adversely affect our results of operations.

The realization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_As our business is conducted in various different currencies, we are, to a limited extent, exposed to_**
**_currency fluctuations. If currency volatilities occur to our disadvantage, this may materially affect_**
**_our financial condition and results of operations._**

We operate in multiple jurisdictions and consequently generate part of our revenue, costs, and earnings
in currencies other than the euro (for example, in Swiss francs, Danish crowns or Bulgarian lev). The
most important foreign currency for us is the Swiss franc. In international markets, our devices are
priced in euros, the value of which has fluctuated significantly in the past. In particular, global volatility
as a result of geopolitical factors and instability in global markets have caused significant fluctuations
in global currencies in recent years.

Overall, as the majority of our sales revenues are generated in the eurozone, our exposure to currency
risk is limited. There is mainly a currency risk for intra-group loans from Techem Energy Services
GmbH to foreign subsidiaries outside the eurozone. The foreign currencies concentrated through cash
pooling are regularly converted into euros using currency swaps and are thus protected against currency
fluctuations.

Other currency risks result from the fact that the revenue of a group company is realized in currencies
other than those of the costs assigned to them. Furthermore, several of our consolidated companies
conduct their accounting in currencies other than the euro, meaning that the corresponding items have
to be translated to euros when consolidating such a group company. For these reasons, we are exposed
to risks that arise due to fluctuations in the relative values of the relevant currencies, particularly
between the euro and the Swiss franc, the Polish zloty, the Danish crown, and the Czech crown. These
currency risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We face fluctuating commodity prices in our contracting business and the prices we charge our_**
**_customers based on index-based price adjustment clauses may not always fully reflect our actual_**
**_purchase prices. In the event of price differences between our actual purchase prices and the indices_**
**_underlying our contracts, we may incur a financial loss that could adversely affect our financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

We face commodity price fluctuations in the context of our energy contracting business which we
operate within Energy Efficiency Solutions. Our recurring revenues generated in this business are
driven by two main components: a base price component which we charge for investments in and
running of a heating and cooling solution, as well as a commodity price component which is based on
the amount of energy we supply.

Most of the agreements with our customers are based on standardized contractual terms and conditions
that have been prepared for a large number of contracts (general supply conditions, _allgemeine_
_Versorgungsbedingungen). Hence, the relevant statutory provision of the German Ordinance on the_
General Terms and Conditions for the Basic Supply of District Heating (Verordnung über Allgemeine


-----

_Bedingungen für die Versorgung mit Fernwärme) requires price clauses which are both transparent for_
the customer and based on the relevant market and cost development. Hence, these agreements usually
contain price adjustment clauses. These adjustment clauses tie the commodity price component we
charge our customers to certain statistical indices. As a result, the prices we charge to our customers are
driven by the development of the indices underlying the price adjustment clauses.

We therefore are exposed to the risk that the costs we incur for energy do not develop in line with the
sales revenue we generate. Although we aim to manage this risk by constantly monitoring and
developing our purchasing strategy to purchase energy at prices that are in line or lower than the ones
resulting from the respective index development, we may incur energy at prices that we cannot fully
pass on to our customers under the price adjustment clauses.

Besides the risks associated with the purchasing prices, we are exposed to the risk that any of our price
adjustment clauses could be declared void by a German court. Our customers regularly challenge the
admissibility of these clauses, in particular in circumstances where the underlying indices are expected
to rise. For these cases we have built up aggregated provisions of less than €0.5 million as of September
30, 2023. Although the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) has developed case law,
there is still room for interpretation with regard to the details of the relevant provisions (e.g., the
admissibility of a certain energy price index). If such clauses were declared void by a German court or
by new legislation this would prevent us from adjusting agreed prices which could have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in accordance with the currently valid German Ordinance on the General Terms and
Conditions for the Basic Supply of District Heating, customers may elect to terminate their contract
with two months’ notice if a customer aims at replacing the energy supply with the use of renewable
energies. Furthermore, some of our agreements have a contract duration of more than ten years, thereby
exceeding the statutory maximum period of ten years under the German Ordinance on the General
Terms and Conditions for the Basic Supply of District Heating. This would allow a customer to declare
the clause void and terminate the contract, unless we are able to prove that the term exceeding ten years
had been agreed individually with the customer. In the event of an effective termination, we would be
unable to generate revenue from the installed heating and cooling solution for the respective customer
and we would be required to uninstall the solution, which could lead to additional costs and thereby
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and thus
on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We could become subject to legal or regulatory actions due to infringements by our suppliers_**
**_resulting in fines or other sanctions which could materially affect our business and financial_**
**_position._**

Suppliers are essential to our business. If our suppliers intentionally or unintentionally violate applicable
laws or regulations, including laws and regulations relating to product compliance and product safety,
embargos, employment health and safety conditions, we could become subject to adverse legal and
regulatory actions. For example, should our suppliers not observe these rules and regulations, we might
be unable to sell some of our products, be required to recall such products or be subject to fines or
penalty payments.

We may be subject to actions under the recently enacted German Supply Chain Act
(Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz (the “Supply Chain Act”)), which started to apply to us on January
1, 2024. The Supply Chain Act establishes a range of obligations for the observance of human rights
on the level of the Company as well as on the level of its direct – and to a certain extent indirect –
business partners. This includes aspects such as (a) the prohibition of child, forced and slave labor, (b)
the observance of workers’ rights including occupational health and safety and organizational and trade
union rights, (c) the prohibition of discrimination and unequal treatment, and (d) compliance with
environmental standards and other environmental rights. In this context, a “supply chain” refers to all
products and services of a company as well as all steps that are necessary to produce the products or


-----

provide the service. Hence, any of our own actions and those of our direct and indirect suppliers are
subject to the Supply Chain Act. The responsibility and liability of the companies bound by the Supply
Chain Act is measured according to the degree of knowledge and influence regarding the respective
supplier and follows a tiered system. The law imposes stricter requirements relating to direct suppliers,
e.g., the obligation to implement risk-based monitoring mechanisms to ensure that direct suppliers
comply with the human rights strategy of the Company, including on-site inspections, use of
certifications and training of direct suppliers. The Federal Office of Economics and Export Control
(Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle) will be entrusted with monitoring compliance with
the corresponding due diligence requirements.

Violations of the Supply Chain Act may be sanctioned both by administrative fines and possible
exclusion from tenders subject to public procurement law. We have reflected our obligations under the
Supply Chain Act in our group-wide supplier code of conduct and generally require written commitment
to our supplier code of conduct by our suppliers which is embedded in our standard procurement
documentation. Any findings under or violations of the Supply Chain Act may lead to significantly
higher compliance costs or require changes to our business. Failure to comply with the Supply Chain
Act could subject us to investigations and administrative fines of up to 2% of group revenue which
could adversely affect our financial condition and our reputation. Furthermore, the framework imposed
by legislation on potential supplier infringements, such as the Supply Chain Act, could in future become
stricter and its scope be extended, for example in the context of an adoption of an EU directive such as
the proposed “EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive,” on which an agreement (pending
formal adoption by the European Parliament) was reached on March 15, 2024. More restrictive or
extensive regulation could result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our financial condition
and thus our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Our international business is exposed to various economic, political and other risks. Adverse_**
**_developments in the global economic environment and geopolitical tensions, as well as disruptions_**
**_in financial markets could reduce demand for our products and services and affect our supply chain_**
**_and thereby have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition._**

We are a global energy management and service provider operating in 18 countries. Therefore, our
financial results and operations are dependent upon macro-economic and political conditions in markets
where we operate or source our products. Rising inflation, supply chain disruptions, weak global
economic growth, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, including in the European sovereign
debt market, as well as political instability and military actions are already adversely impacting the
global economy. This could, among other things, lead to fiscal reforms, currency instability, increased
counterparty credit risk, and high levels of volatility, each of which, alone or combined with other
factors, could affect the demand for our products and services. For example, rising inflation, which in
turn has led to higher interest rates, may result in reduced new construction activity and thus reduced
growth in our markets. Any such reduced market growth could in turn affect our business, results of
operations, financial condition, and access to credit and capital markets.

The political conditions we are exposed to in the jurisdictions in which we operate or source our
products, that could further pose a risk to our business, include, among other factors, the modification
or termination of current trade agreements, increasing protectionism or uncertainties regarding the
future political development in our target markets. In particular, policies, measures, controls, or other
actions implemented by the governments of countries may restrict our business operations or harm our
financial results. As a result, our revenue is exposed to risks inherent to the country where we operate
or intend to operate.

We also face economic risks associated with ongoing geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China.
Currently, certain of our electronic components for our metering devices are manufactured in Taiwan.
Accordingly, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by
changes in governmental policies, taxation, social instability, and diplomatic and social developments
in or affecting Taiwan. In particular, the political status of Taiwan and its political movement cause


-----

sustained tension between China and Taiwan. Past developments related to the interactions between
China and Taiwan, especially in relation to trade activities such as bans on exports of goods from time
to time, have on occasions depressed the transactions and business operations of certain Taiwanese
companies and overall economic environment in Taiwan. The worsening of the relationship could delay
or disrupt imports from China, which could in turn adversely affect our supply chains. It is uncertain
whether the tensions between China and Taiwan will escalate which in turn could result in new bans or
tariffs on exports or our suppliers could not be able anymore to manufacture and ship required electronic
components. Changes in political conditions in the United States and China and changes in the ChinaU.S. relations also are difficult to predict and could adversely affect our business. Recently, the United
States has been assessing trade agreements and has imposed significant increases on tariffs on imported
goods, particularly those from China. Other countries have imposed similar tariffs on goods from China
entering their countries. For example, as our new multi-sensor device is manufactured in China,
potential export bans or tariffs could adversely affect our business. If we had to shift our manufacturing
partner for the multi-sensor device, we may not be able to find a suitable partner on acceptable terms or
on a timely basis.

Furthermore, the prevailing geopolitical situation has a significant impact on global economic
conditions. The Russia-Ukraine War, continues to create substantial disruptions in the region and
beyond. We are no longer active in the Russian market having sold our Russian subsidiary in 2016 and
ceased all business with it since the start of the Russia-Ukraine War. However, the invasion, as well as
the measures adopted, or that may be adopted in the future by other countries in response to it, including
new and stricter sanctions by the EU, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries and
organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, the so-called Donetsk
People’s Republic, the so-called Luhansk People’s Republic, the Crimea Region of Ukraine and Belarus
(or other regions or countries that were to become involved), may further exacerbate price inflation for
critical supplies, such as electronic components, and disrupt supply chains, which could have a material
adverse effect on our operations, demand for our products and our profitability. Rising inflation rates
could also lead to increased personnel costs, including as a result of increasing wages. Personnel costs
represent one of our most significant cost items amounting to €304.6 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2023, an increase of 22.2% compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2022.

Restrictions regarding the export of Russian coal, oil and gas, or cessation or limitation of supply by
Russian suppliers have already resulted and are expected to further result in a significant increase in
energy prices and might endanger the continuous energy supply in the EU. While potential increases in
energy costs that landlords and tenants may face as a result of rising energy prices and disruptions to
energy supplies do not directly impact our metering and cost allocation activities, such developments
have already resulted in, and may continue to result in, higher prices for raw materials and components
that we procure form our suppliers.

These developments already have and are expected to continue to have a significant adverse macroeconomic impact in Europe and globally. It is not yet possible to predict with sufficient certainty the
extent and impact which these and additional developments will have on the global economy, the
financial markets, and the industry in which we operate. Depending on the duration and the further
development of the Russia-Ukraine War, the related economic risks might further increase and there
might be a long-lasting negative impact on the global economy.

Furthermore, pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks of infectious diseases or any other serious public health
crises, similar to the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, together with any measures aimed at mitigating a
further expansion of such diseases, such as government-imposed lockdowns, quarantines, or other
social distancing measures, could have a material adverse effect on the global economy in general and
on our business activities. For example, future lockdowns or social distancing measures could restrict
us from accessing buildings to install new devices, take manual readings from metering devices or
maintain already installed metering devices or detectors. During the lockdowns related to COVID-19
we experienced delays in the sale of these products and services which adversely affected our revenues
during this period.


-----

We currently operate and offer our products and services in 17 countries outside Germany. We have
gradually expanded our international presence over the last decades, to the markets in Poland (1992),
Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia (each in 1993), Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland (each in 1995), Belgium
(1997) and Bulgaria (1999). Most recently, our international expansion continued by entering markets
such as Brazil and Denmark in 2006, and Norway and Spain in 2014. In some of the countries where
we offer our products and services and where we seek to expand our activities, such as Brazil, we may
not be sufficiently familiar with the cultural traditions and customs of the markets with a lesser degree
of political, economic, and legal stability may prevail as compared to Germany or the EU. This applies,
in particular, to some of the countries that we have identified as growth markets for our products and
services such as Poland. For this reason, we are exposed to a range of factors that we cannot influence
and that could have an impact on our business activities in these countries. These factors include the
following:

- political, social, economic, financial, and market-related instability and volatility in markets in
which we are present, which may reduce the demand for our products and services;

- foreign currency control provisions and other regulations or impairments in terms of exchange
rates and foreign currencies, such as the lifting of exchange rate pegs and delays on the
repatriation of earnings, for example with regard to our most important currency Swiss francs,
as well as for Danish crowns or Bulgarian lev;

- inadequate infrastructure in the buildings in which our devices are installed, which may impede
accessibility to installed submeters;

- trade restrictions, in particular associated with geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China
as our new multi-sensor device is manufactured in China, which may provide additional
burdens for the import of our products to service countries;

- inadequately developed and differentiated legal and administrative systems, which can lead, for
example, to the inadequate protection of intellectual property rights (such as our patented
innovations which we use in metering devices with radio transmission, for manipulation
protection purposes, as well as in systems and processes for reducing the energy consumption
in buildings, which may harm our competitiveness and therefore market position, or can
jeopardize the enforcement of receivables and other claims which may in turn adversely affect
our financial position and results of operations; and

- the risk that legal framework conditions will become less favorable to our business, or the
enforcement of existing regulation by authorities, in particular with regard to the regulatory
environment for the requirement of consumption-based submetering and billing of heat and
water consumption in Europe, which may reduce the demand for our products and services.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly
uncertain, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have
forecasted or historically observed. Any of the foregoing developments (individually or in aggregate),
or a perception that any of these developments may be likely to occur, could have a material adverse
effect on the economic development of the affected countries or lead to economic recession or
depression that could jeopardize the stability of financial markets or the overall financial and monetary
system.

A failure to adequately respond to the needs of our operations in the various jurisdictions in which we
are active, or a material deterioration in any of the factors named above could, directly or indirectly,
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and thus on
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.


-----

**_A large portion of our operations are carried out, and revenue is generated, in Germany, which_**
**_exposes our business to adverse political or economic developments directly or indirectly affecting_**
**_Germany. Such adverse developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our business in Germany accounted for the vast majority of our revenue for the financial year ended
September 30, 2023. In light of this concentration, our business is sensitive to political or economic
developments that impact Germany or otherwise affect our operations in Germany. In particular,
changes to European or national legislation, such as the Energy Efficiency Directive (“EED”) or the
German Heating Cost Ordinance (Heizkostenverordnung) could have a detrimental effect on our
business model. For example, the German Social Democratic Party, which is part of the current
government coalition, recently published a position paper calling for better protection of tenants against
excessive additional costs (Nebenkosten). Adverse political or economic developments affecting
Germany could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We are exposed to general counterparty risk._**

As part of our business, we have contracts with a variety of entities. We face exposure to risks associated
with the financial stability of these counterparties. Should a counterparty go bankrupt or renege on its
contractual commitments to us, we may not realize the full value of our contractual investment or may
incur costs enforcing our contractual rights. This risk holds especially true for our energy contracting
business segment where single contracts are worth several hundreds of thousands of euros to us over
the lifetime of the contract. If we incur significant losses based on our exposure to counterparties, our
results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted and we may not be able to
fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees as a result.

**_The actions of our senior management, employees, contractors, and partners may expose us to_**
**_liabilities and harm our business and reputation._**

As a group operating in many jurisdictions, we are subject to international, European, national, and
local laws, regulations, and ordinances. We are subject to many different regulatory requirements that
change frequently, evolve continuously, and may become more stringent.

In addition, misconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable competition and other laws and
regulations or other improper activities by one of our members of senior management, employees,
contractors or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such
misconduct could include the failure to comply with applicable law or regulations, including tax laws,
environmental laws, anti-bribery laws, regulations pertaining to internal controls over financial
reporting and international sanctions, and competition and consumer-protection laws, particularly if our
customers filed complaints against us alleging anti-competitive practices, as well as failure to comply
with our internal controls and procedures and code of conduct policies designed to help us comply with
such laws and regulations. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities have not always
been effective and may not be effective in the future, particularly given our international operations and
size, since our internal controls are subject to inherent limitations, including human error, and the
possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions
and fraud. Although we have established a corporate governance and organizational structure that we
believe enables us to exercise Group-wide control over our operations and have adopted Group-wide
control procedures and reporting and code of conduct policies, these policies and procedures may not
be adequate to prevent or detect inadequate practices, accounting deficiencies, or violations of
applicable laws or regulations. For example, an internal compliance audit conducted at Techem
Romania during February and March 2018 identified potential improper contract procurement
commissions payments paid to members of our sales personnel. The relevant employees of Techem
Romania are no longer working at Techem Romania as of March 26, 2018. In addition, in May 2018,


-----

we learned that two employees of Techem Romania allegedly paid money to property managers in
contravention of our compliance policies. In May 2018, Techem Romania self-reported the alleged
activity to the Romanian authorities. The investigation has concluded and the Romanian authorities
have decided not to take any action at this time.

Our failure, or the failure of our members of senior management, employees, contractors or partners, to
comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could require significant time and
resources from management, and could result in fines or penalties, cause reputational harm, damage
relationships with customers and suppliers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us or such parties
to criminal and civil enforcement actions.

**_Operators of combined heat and power units in Germany may benefit from price support schemes_**
**_under the Act on Combined Heat and Power Generation and the Act on Renewable Energy Sources._**
**_Recent and future amendments to these regulations could have a negative impact on our business._**

Operators of CHP-units may claim remuneration for the production of electricity under the price support
schemes of the Act on Combined Heat and Power Generation (Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsgesetz) (the
“KWKG”) or the Act on Renewable Energy Sources (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz) (the “EEG”).
Amendments to these acts have restricted the conditions under which operators may claim
remuneration. In particular, operators of a large number of energy production facilities may claim
support payments only if they win an award in a competitive tender process. For example, remuneration
for CHP-units with a capacity of more than 500 kilowatt and less than 50 megawatt and put into
operation after December 31, 2016, is generally determined through a tender process conducted by the
Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur). The total electrical capacity that may be awarded in
Germany each calendar year is limited. Whereas the amendments did not have an impact on the units
we already operated when they entered into force, units we have commissioned since then and may
commission in the future have been and are likely to be subject to a tender process if we intend to claim
remuneration. If other operators submit more competitive bids and win the tender process, we risk not
being awarded remuneration, with the consequences that we must charge market prices for the
electricity we produce and we will not benefit from the price support regime under the KWKG or EEG.
New European Union legislation will provide that support for new installations will only be granted on
the basis of double-sided contracts-for-difference and it is possible that future legislation will further
restrict price support under the KWKG and EEG, which may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Most of our balance sheet assets consist of intangible assets, the valuation of which could be impaired_**
**_from year to year by changing future prospects, which may adversely affect our financial condition._**

We recognized extensive intangible assets of €4.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, which made up
79.5% of the consolidated balance sheet total. Our intangible assets primarily consist of capitalized
customer relationships, which are regularly amortized using the straight-line method, in the amount of
€1.8 billion, goodwill of €2.3 billion and the trademark “Techem” of €215.6 million, each as of
December 31, 2023.

In compliance with IAS 36 (Impairment of assets), goodwill and other intangible assets with an
indefinite useful life is subject to an annual impairment test. The recoverable amount of each of our
cash generating unit (“CGU”) Energy Services Germany, Energy Services International and Energy
Efficiency Solutions is determined by calculating the value in use or fair value less costs of disposal.
Future cash flows are based on assumed growth rates which are based on historical trends. If the
carrying amount of a group of CGUs exceeds the calculated recoverable amount an impairment loss
must be recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and thus on
our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We are regularly audited and could be required to pay additional taxes and other sums, which could_**
**_be significant, following audits of us or our subsidiaries._**

We are regularly subject to tax audits. In ongoing or future tax audits, the tax laws, or relevant facts,
e.g., in relation to acquisitions or restructuring activities, could be interpreted by the tax authorities in
any applicable jurisdiction in a manner deviating from the relevant company’s view. As a result, the tax
authorities could revise original tax assessments and substantially increase the tax burden (including
interest and penalty payments) of the relevant company.

Our most recent tax audit covered the financial years 2010 up to and including 2015 and was completed
without a finding. We currently are subject to a tax audit in Germany for the financial years 2017
through 2019 which has a focus on transfer pricing. Until now there are no findings. Tax audits for
periods not yet finally reviewed may lead to higher tax assessments, interest, and penalty charges, all
of which could result in significant cash payments to the relevant tax authority. We have not yet set
aside a reserve for current or future tax audits that could be used to cover any payments we might have
to make with respect to any previous tax or financial year.

We have taken out loans in connection with our business activities which require interest payments. For
German income tax purposes, the deduction of interest on loans may be restricted by the interest barrier
(Zinsschranke) rules and other rules limiting the tax deductibility of interest expenses. We have relied
on the “escape clause” of the German interest barrier rules for our tax returns for all completed financial
years since April 1, 2009, until March 31, 2018, enabling us to deduct interest expenses without being
subject to these barrier rules. The German interest barrier rules were first introduced in 2008 and a
number of technical points of the rules and its exemptions remain unclear given the limited tax authority
guidance and case law available. If the German tax authorities were to challenge our application of the
escape clause, such challenge would have to be analyzed for each individual year and may affect one
or more of all tax years since April 1, 2016, until March 31, 2018. Should the German tax authorities
hence challenge our position, reopen our tax returns, and ultimately retroactively assess higher taxes,
we would become liable to pay the incremental tax amounts, together with interest and penalties, for
each of the financial years since April 1, 2017, for which our position would have been successfully
challenged by the tax authorities. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have not made a
provision to cover the risk of any such reassessment. For tax periods from April 1, 2019, we applied the
general German interest barrier rules: interest expenses of a business can basically be taken into account
in a tax-reducing manner in the amount of the interest income of the same business year. If the balance
of interest expenses and interest income is negative, the deductibility of the interest balance is generally
limited to 30% of EBITDA adjusted for tax purposes. Therefore, the applicability of the interest barrier
depends on the earnings we achieve; these earnings fluctuate and therefore cannot be predicted with
any certainty. If we are increasingly affected by the applicability of these regulations in the future, this
would result in a higher tax burden.

In addition, in Germany, we are subject to an ongoing wage tax audit for the years 2019 through 2022
and an ongoing tax audit which is related to energy taxes for the year 2018. For both tax audits there
are no findings until now.

Any additional taxes or other sums that become due could have a material adverse effect on our cash
flows, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

**_Rules regarding the forfeiture of tax loss carry forwards under German law may prevent us from_**
**_using any future loss carry forwards to set off future gains which could significantly increase our_**
**_tax burden._**

As of December 31, 2023, Techem Group in Germany has tax loss carried forward of approximately
€1.3 million in total for both corporate income and trade tax purposes which, in each case, are neither
assessed nor audited by the respective competent tax authority yet. Such losses can only be used subject


-----

to the minimum taxation, i.e., losses in an amount of €1 million can be deducted without limitation, and
any exceeding losses can only be deducted in an amount of 60% of the income exceeding €1 million.
Under German tax laws, any future tax loss carry forwards and unused tax losses in any future period
will forfeit in full if more than 50% of the subscribed capital, membership rights, participation rights or
voting rights in the respective company are transferred, directly or indirectly, to an acquirer or related
parties of such acquirer (or a group of acquirers with common interests) within a period of five years or
in case of comparable measures (harmful acquisition). The same applies for interest carry forwards. If
and to the extent the tax loss carry forwards, interest carry forwards and unused losses of the current
financial year are covered by the built-in gains of the loss-making company’s business assets that are
subject to domestic taxation a forfeiture of such items would generally not apply.

**_We may acquire businesses that could potentially deliver lower financial performance than_**
**_anticipated and may have unexpected liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial condition._**
**_Acquired businesses may not operate in compliance with data protection legislation, and we may_**
**_experience difficulties integrating acquired businesses in a timely manner, in which case we may_**
**_have to incur additional costs to realize the anticipated potential of the acquisition which could_**
**_adversely affect our financial condition._**

Within Energy Services, we have acquired small businesses related to the cost allocation of heat and
water as well as to the rental and the sale of metering devices (in Germany and selective foreign
countries). For example, in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 we acquired 8 businesses, in
the financial year ended September 30, 2022 we acquired 12 businesses, and in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021 we acquired 8 businesses. In the financial year ended September 30, 2023, our net
cash outflow relating to acquisitions amounted to €62.8 million (financial year ended September 30,
2022: €59.8 million). As a consequence, our results, in particular revenue, has partly been driven by
such acquisitions. As part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue to pursue the acquisitions of
businesses to generate future growth. Acquisitions may be pursued to expand our service and product
portfolio as well as geographic reach.

We may experience difficulties in integrating newly acquired businesses, and the anticipated benefits
of such acquisitions may not be realized fully (or at all) and may take longer to realize than expected.
Our future performance will depend in part on whether we can effectively and efficiently integrate
acquired businesses, which may be complex, time consuming and expensive and may involve a number
of risks. These include potential non-compliance with data protection legislation (including GDPR) as
the controls and procedures in place in acquired businesses may either not be sufficiently designed to
comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection laws of
other jurisdictions in which we operate, or such procedures and controls may not be effective in ensuring
compliance or preventing unauthorized transfers of personal data. Further risks involved with the
integration of business include diversion of management resources from our operative business, the
failure to retain key employees of the acquired targets, the failure to improve processes, the integration
of IT structure and IT security, and the costs and expenses associated with any unexpected difficulties
with respect to such assets and companies.

Even if we are able to integrate newly acquired businesses successfully, we nevertheless may not realize
synergies, cost savings, revenue and cash flow enhancements, growth, operational efficiencies, and
other benefits that we expect. Acquired businesses may also have unexpected liabilities for which we
will be responsible.

We may also exit some of our markets and by disposing of businesses in the future, in particular with a
view on anticipated attractiveness and risks involved with operations in such markets. For example, we
have exited the markets in Serbia, Russia, Turkey, the Swedish market and most recently the market in
the United Arab Emirates. However, our ability to selectively dispose of businesses at attractive terms
and conditions depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and we may not
be able to dispose of a business in a timely manner. For example, if we are seeking a buyer for a
particular business line, no suitable buyer may be available, or we may not be successful in negotiating


-----

satisfactory terms with prospective buyers or internally with works councils or employee
representatives to the extent we are required to do so. Even if a disposal is successful, we may face
indemnity and other liability claims by the acquirer or other parties.

As a result of the foregoing, any acquisitions (or attempted acquisitions) or disposals (or attempted
disposals) could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, not result with the
expected benefits and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition
and cash flows and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We could face labor disputes with our employees, which would disrupt our business and could_**
**_materially affect our results of operations._**

Most of our employees are entitled to be represented by local works councils formed at their site of
employment, which negotiate with management on behalf of those employees in respect of matters
affecting employment and employee benefits. We may also encounter strikes or other disturbances, or
threats of strikes or disturbances occasioned by our labor force, and upon the expiration of existing
employment agreements, we may be unable to reach new agreements on satisfactory terms or without
work stoppages, strikes or similar actions. Furthermore, we have undertaken ongoing initiatives to
optimize our cost positions and to create the foundation for a straight-through processing environment
that seamlessly automates processes in our core functions, including our ENERGIZE-T value creation
program. We may be unable to fully realize the savings expected as a result of our value creation
program ENERGIZE-T due to additional costs from any employee claims or from existing employment
arrangements, including increased severance costs.

In addition, we use a significant number of subcontractors for, among other things, submetering, and
smoke detection services, such as submeter reading, installation, testing, maintenance, and replacement.
Even though we regularly conduct risk analyses for potential sham self-employments, we remain
exposed to the risk that if any of these subcontractors were recharacterized as our employees, we could
be required to pay salary, social insurance contributions, tax, and other benefits on a retroactive basis
for such persons. If disputes with our works councils arise or our employees engage in a strike or other
work stoppage, or if we need to incur higher personnel costs or experience a significant disruption of
operations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
condition and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_Our compliance and risk management systems may prove to be inadequate. If such systems fail to_**
**_prevent, identify, and address violations, this could result in penalties, other penalties and_**
**_reputational damage._**

Members of our governing bodies, senior management, employees, representatives, or agents may
intentionally or unintentionally violate applicable laws and internal quality standards and procedures,
in particular in relation to anti-corruption, money-laundering, antitrust, competition and sanctions
compliance as well as compliance with laws and regulations regarding sales practices, products and
services, environment, finance, employment, taxation and general corporate and criminal law. Our
internal controls, procedures, compliance, and risk management systems may not be able to identify
such violations, ensure that they are reported in a timely manner, evaluate them correctly or address
them with the appropriate countermeasures. For example, we have identified weaknesses in our risk
management processes in markets which we recently entered. Further, we may face particular
challenges in assuring adequate and sufficient compliance measures as well their monitoring given the
scale of our global operations as well as the various acquisitions we have conducted in the past. Last,
these systems are not designed to identify non-compliance with such laws, rules and regulations by our
members of senior management or employees in their personal capacity.


-----

For example, our members of senior management and employees could engage in discussions and come
to informal agreements with competitors on their participation or non-participation in tenders to secure
tender business for us. Furthermore, our personnel from our strategy, marketing or sales departments
may align with some of our competitors and discuss pricing approaches, intentions with regard to new
market entrances or other restrictions to the competition between them and us. For our business in
emerging markets, we also rely on consultants and intermediaries for the sale of our products and
services, and their services may bear the risk of engaging in corrupt practices.

There can further be no certainty that any countermeasures we implement will be appropriate to reduce
the corresponding risks effectively, that breaches of law, regulations or internal controls have not
occurred in the past or that their discovery would not result in significant liability or reputational damage
for us. Moreover, given the evolving legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, there
can be no certainty that our risk management systems, internal controls and compliance systems and
related governance structures will adequately identify and address all relevant requirements.

Any failure to effectively prevent, identify and/or address violations of our legal obligations as a result
of inadequate internal controls, procedures, compliance systems and risk management systems could
result in penalties, other sanctions, liabilities, the assertion of damages claims by third parties, and
reputational damage, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
our reputation and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Guarantees.

**_We may not realize any or all of our estimated cost savings, gains and synergies, which would have_**
**_a negative effect on our results of operations._**

This Offering Memorandum includes statements on our estimated cost savings, gains and synergies and
adjustments as if such cost savings, gains and synergies had been fully realized at the beginning of the
relevant period. The estimated cost savings, gains and synergies are based on a number of assumptions
made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such
information. The assumptions used in estimating cost savings, gains and synergies are inherently
uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our estimates
of cost savings, gains and synergies. Our ability to realize the expected cost savings, gains and synergies
associated with the adjustments included when calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA and other non–IFRS financial measures depends on factors beyond our control, such as
operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors and customers, delays in implementing
initiatives and general economic or industry conditions. These numbers have not been, and cannot be,
audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. This information is inherently subject
to risks and uncertainties. We may be required to make cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings,
gains and synergies, and these costs are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA or Run-Rate Adjusted
EBITDA. We cannot assure you that these cash expenditures to achieve such cost savings, gains and
synergies will not be higher than we anticipated. In addition, we may not fully realize such cost savings,
gains and synergies on a timely manner, and may not do so at all. Accordingly, you should not view
our presentation of this adjustment in our Adjusted EBITDA or Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA as a
projection that we will achieve these cost savings, gains or synergies. Our ability to realize these
anticipated gains and synergies is subject to significant uncertainties and you should not place undue
reliance on the adjustments in evaluating our anticipated results.

This information may not be comparable to our Consolidated Financial Statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and should not be relied upon when making an
investment decision. Adjusted EBITDA and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA are included in this Offering
Memorandum because we believe they are helpful to investors as measures of our operating
performance and ability to service our debt. These measures are not measurements of financial
performance under IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute to other indicators of our operating
performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS.


-----

In addition, any cost savings, gains and synergies that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by
reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses, including as a result of the actions we
take. As a result, our future performance may differ significantly from the _pro forma financial_
information set forth herein.

**_The third-party ESG rating referenced in this Offering Memorandum may not accurately reflect the_**
**_ESG-related risks. Any change in the ESG risk ratings of the Group or any actual or perceived lack_**
**_of transparency or underperformance regarding ESG matters as a result of increasing scrutiny and_**
**_changing expectations from investors, lender and other market participants may adversely affect the_**
**_value of the Notes._**

On April 13, 2023, Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH had a Corporate ESG Assessment score
of 8.7 (the “Rating”) by Sustainalytics, which places it in the “Negligible Risk” category. Sustainalytics
is not subject to any regulatory or other governmental oversight in respect of its determination of ESG
risk ratings or the underlying methodologies it uses to make such determinations. The Rating is
published on the Sustainalytics’ website (the “Website”), but neither the Rating, nor any other
information on the Website, is incorporated by reference into this Offering Memorandum. In its
preparation of the Rating, Sustainalytics has relied on the reliability, accuracy and completeness of the
information provided to it by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, but there can be no guarantee
that such information is reliable, accurate or complete.

The Rating and any other ESG risk rating obtained by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH from
time to time may not reflect the potential impact of all ESG-related risks and information relevant to
the Group, or additional risk factors discussed herein, or other factors that may affect the value of the
Group, but rather reflect only the views and methodologies of the relevant ESG rating provider(s) at the
time the rating is issued. ESG rating providers use different ratings methodologies to produce their ESG
risk ratings and their valuations may be based on only publicly available information and in other cases
may be based on information supplied by the relevant companies. As such, the quality of information
in respect of each company included in Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH’s rankings may not
be comparable and there may therefore be limitations on the utility of these rankings. Each ESG rating
provider’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other ESG rating provider’s rating. There is
no guarantee that the methodology used by any particular ESG rating provider (including those applied
by Sustainalytics for the purpose of the Rating) will conform with the expectations or requirements of
any investor or any present or future applicable standards, recommendations, criteria, laws, regulations,
guidelines or listing rules. ESG risk ratings do not comment as to market price or suitability for
investors. ESG rating providers (including Sustainalytics) may revise or replace entirely the
methodology applied to derive ESG risk ratings. Any ESG risk rating obtained by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH provides no guarantee as to the actual environmental and/or social
impacts of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH.

No assurance can be given that the Rating and any other ESG risk rating will remain constant for any
given period of time or that an ESG risk rating will not be increased or withdrawn entirely by the ESG
rating provider if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. Any negative change, or an
indication of a possible negative change, in the Rating or in any other ESG risk ratings obtained by
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH from time to time, could impair or preclude the Group from
accessing certain financial markets and products, thereby adversely affecting the Group’s liquidity.
Further, any negative change, or an indication of a possible negative change, in the Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH’s ESG risk ratings may adversely affect the reputation of Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH and/or be reflective of fundamental weaknesses and/or risks in the
sustainability of its business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, and investors may
also be required or choose to sell their holdings in the Group. This could have a material adverse effect
on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

**Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Corporate Structure**

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue-generating operations_**
**_of its own and depends on cash from the operating companies of the Group to be able to meet its_**
**_financial obligations and make payments on the Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Issuer does not receive sufficient funds by its subsidiaries, it may be unable to pay interest._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company with no business operations and its principal
assets are the equity interests it holds in each of its subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is
dependent upon the cash flow from its operating subsidiaries in the form of dividends, interest payments
on intercompany loans or other distributions to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes. If the subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer do not fulfill their
obligations under certain intercompany loans to make scheduled payments, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may not have any other source of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes. The amounts of such payments, dividends and other distributions available
to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will depend on the profitability and cash flows of its subsidiaries as
well as the ability of those subsidiaries to declare dividends under applicable law. The subsidiaries of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, however, may not be able, or may not be permitted under applicable
law, to make distributions, make interest payments on, or otherwise advance upstream loans to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make payments in respect of its debt, including the Senior Secured
Notes. While the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will limit the ability of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other
intercompany payments, these limitations are subject to significant qualifications and exceptions,
including exceptions for restrictions imposed by applicable law. In addition, the subsidiaries of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes have no obligation to make
payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability
of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable law may also limit the
amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their
equity interests, or even prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will generally be limited to
the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the ability to pay their respective
debts when due. Techem Metering is organized under German law which provides that dividends may
only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally, interim dividend
contributions are not allowed under German law. The subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes have no direct obligation to make payments with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees.

**_Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses._**

We currently have, and after the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes will continue to have, a significant
amount of outstanding debt with substantial debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2023, on
an unaudited as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, we would have had €2,864.8 million
of outstanding total indebtedness (excluding shareholder indebtedness), including €500.0 million in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, €1,800.0 million in aggregate
principal amount of borrowings under Facility B, €363.9 million of Senior Notes, €155.7 million of
lease liabilities and €2.4 million of other third-party borrowings. See “Capitalization.” In addition, our
Revolving Credit Facility will, following completion of the Senior Facilities Extension and Upsize,
provide for borrowings up to an aggregate of €398.4 million, subject to certain conditions. We expect
that €42.8 million of drawings will be outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date
and that approximately €5.1 million in non-cash guarantees under the Revolving Credit Facility will
remain outstanding. We anticipate that our high leverage will continue to exist for the foreseeable future
and the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Notes Indenture provide us with significant flexibility to incur additional debt and make


-----

distributions. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and
operations and for holders of the Senior Secured Notes, including, but not limited to:

- making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes and our other debts and liabilities;

- requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our debt, thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital
expenditure, R&D, acquisitions, organic growth projects and for other general corporate
purposes;

- increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry
conditions;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or
greater financial resources than we have;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

- negatively impacting credit terms with our suppliers and other creditors;

- increasing our exposure to interest rate increases because some of our indebtedness bears a
floating rate of interest, placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors
that are not as highly leveraged and restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or
exploiting certain business opportunities; and

- limiting, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in
the future to fund future operations, capital expenditures, business opportunities, acquisitions
and other general corporate purposes and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Senior Secured Notes. Our ability to make payments on and
refinance our debt and to fund acquisitions, working capital expenditures and other expenses will
depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to
generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and
regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or to fund our future
acquisitions or other working capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, including debt in
connection with future acquisitions. The terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes
Indenture permit, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit, our subsidiaries to do so, in each
case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now
face could intensify. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”_

**_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our_**
**_debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, and impair our ability to operate our business._**

We may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Although the Senior Notes Indenture and the
Senior Facilities Agreement contain, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain, restrictions
on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of debt that could be
incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Under the Senior Notes Indenture
and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in addition to specified permitted debt, we or the Senior Notes


-----

Issuer are, or will be, able to incur additional debt so long as, on a pro forma basis, our or the Senior
Notes Issuer’s Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Notes Indenture) is at least 2.00 to 1.00 or our or the Senior Notes Issuer’s Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture)
does not exceed 7.2 to 1.0. In addition, in order to incur Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the
Senior Facilities Agreement) under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, our Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) may not exceed, on a pro forma basis, 5.80 to 1.00 or such debt would require capacity
under certain specified permitted debt baskets. We are also able, or will be able, to refinance debt
outstanding under our Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture with debt incurred
in compliance with these ratios. In addition, we can test these ratios at the time of commitment of
additional debt and then be able to draw amounts at a time when we do not meet these ratios. The terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit us to incur future debt that may have substantially
the same covenants as, or covenants that are more restrictive than, those of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Moreover, some of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Senior Secured
Notes (such as at the level of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes). We may
incur debt that shares in the Collateral, that may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Senior
Secured Notes and the Guarantees or could mature prior to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and our Senior Facilities Agreement do not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute debt under those agreements. The incurrence
of additional debt would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum.
An inability to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position,
results of operations and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Guarantees.

We are subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating, strategic and financial flexibility.

Our Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture contain, and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will contain, covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way we can operate,
including restrictions on our ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures or
undertaking capital expenditures;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- create unrestricted subsidiaries;

- agree to limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions;

- sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

- sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

- issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries;


-----

- impair the security interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes;
and

- create or incur certain liens.

These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to react to
market conditions or regulatory developments or take advantage of potential business opportunities as
they arise. For example, such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations,
pursue acquisitions, investments or alliances, restructure our organization or finance our capital needs
or such acquisitions.

**_Our failure to comply with the covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured_**
**_Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture, including as a result of events beyond our control,_**
**_could result in an event of default that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture require, and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will require, us to comply with various covenants, including a springing financial covenant
in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility requiring us to maintain a specified senior secured net
leverage ratio and which is tested when loans under the Revolving Credit Facility (subject to certain
exceptions) aggregate 40% of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of that
testing date (or, if higher, the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the date of
the Senior Facilities Agreement) on the last day of a financial quarter. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.” Our ability to meet this financial ratio could be affected_
by a deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including, without
limitation, unfavorable economic conditions, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet this
ratio. Moreover, the Senior Facilities Agreement includes certain events of default (including, among
other things, events of default for breaches of representations and warranties and an event of default for
our failure to make principal payments when due on certain other debt) that are in addition to the events
of default set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture. Subject to a
clean-up period lasting until the date falling 180 days after any permitted acquisition, if an event of
default occurs and is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the agent under the Senior
Facilities Agreement (if directed by the majority lenders thereunder (or majority lenders under the
Revolving Credit Facility in the case of a financial covenant default)) could, among other things,
terminate any available facilities, cancel any undrawn commitments and declare all amounts borrowed,
together with accrued and unpaid interest and any other sums then payable, to be immediately due and
payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments, including the Senior Secured Notes, that contain
cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions also may be accelerated or become payable on demand
in the event that acceleration occurs under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In these circumstances, our
assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to repay in full that debt and our other debt, including the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding, if some or all of these instruments were accelerated, which
could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, and we might not be able to repay our obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes in such an event.

**_The Senior Notes will mature prior to the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer_**
**_may not be able to repay, redeem or otherwise refinance such indebtedness._**

On an as adjusted basis following the completion of the Transactions, we expect that €363.9 million
will be outstanding under the Senior Notes. An inability to repay, delay in refinancing, or the inability
to refinance on commercially acceptable terms debt falling due in accordance with the maturity schedule
of our indebtedness may result in an acceleration of such debt, and enforcement over our assets. The
type, timing and terms of any future financing will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing
conditions in the financial markets. The refinancing of existing debt may be on different terms than our
current ones, which, among other things, could drive an increase in debt service costs, thereby restricting
our degree of flexibility. If we are unable to refinance our debt when due, we may not be able to satisfy


-----

our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Furthermore, any failure to repay amounts outstanding
under the Senior Notes may result in a default under the Senior Secured Notes and Senior Facilities as
a result of the cross-default provisions set forth in the Indenture and Senior Facilities Agreement. For
details of the maturity profile of our debt, see “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt or sustain our operations, including_**
**_due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our debt_**
**_obligations, which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make payments on or to refinance the Senior Secured Notes or our other debt obligations,
and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance
and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive,
market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient
to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debt, including the Senior Secured Notes,
or to fund our liquidity needs. If we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital
resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be required to
refinance or restructure our indebtedness. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital
resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be
forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, on or
before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms,
if at all.

In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial
condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current
debt and may require us to comply with more-onerous covenants, which could further restrict our
business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to
find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms
that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance our debt, obtain additional financing
or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt
obligations, including under the Senior Secured Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt
agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may become
payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Senior
Secured Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding debt on a timely
basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur
additional debt. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial
liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt
service and other obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain
dispositions or obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and
any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service


-----

obligations then due. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities limit,
or will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any
refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict out business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities limit, or will limit, and
any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt
could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which
could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations_**
**_and financial condition._**

We are subject to complex tax laws. Changes in tax laws could adversely affect our tax position,
including our effective tax rate or tax payments. We often rely on generally available interpretations of
applicable tax laws and regulations. There cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in
agreement with our interpretation of these laws. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax
authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not
collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase
our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We might be exposed to risks resulting from deviating interpretations of applicable tax laws by the_**
**_tax authorities or adverse amendments to current legislation which could result in additional tax_**
**_burden._**

Our business is subject to the general tax environment in the countries in which we operate. Changes in
tax legislation, administrative practice or case law which deviate from our assessments could result in
a higher tax burden. We cannot exclude that we may be impacted by tax effects as a result of the
impending application of the global minimum taxation rules and additional tax burdens may have
adverse effects on our cash flows and financial condition and thus on our ability to fulfill our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

We could fail, whether inadvertently or through reasons beyond our control, to comply with tax laws
and regulations relating to the tax treatment of various of our financing arrangements, which could
result in unfavorable tax treatment for such arrangements. If any competent tax authorities were to
successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of, e.g., any of our intercompany loans or
transactions, this could result in the disallowance of deductions, a limitation on our ability to deduct
interest expenses, the imposition of withholding taxes, the application of significant penalties and
accrued interest on intercompany loans or internal deemed transfers which would have a material
adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations and thus on our ability to
fulfill our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

Due to our operations in various jurisdictions, we are exposed to various tax risks, including risks based
on transfer pricing rules which apply to cross-border business relationships. Pursuant to such transfer
pricing rules, related enterprises are required to conduct any inter-company transactions on conditions
which would also apply among unrelated third parties concluding comparable agreements (so-called
“arm’s length principle”) and to sufficiently document the relevant transactions, subject to the rules
applicable to them in the relevant jurisdiction. It cannot be ruled out that one or more tax authorities
will challenge our compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules. For example, our documentation
may be considered to be insufficient by the relevant tax authorities or transfer prices may be considered
to be inadequate or inadequately justified. This may result in double taxation in two or more


-----

jurisdictions and penalties. Transfer pricing risks may increase in the future in case our intra-group
cross-border business grows or changes or if tax authorities change their interpretation of applicable
transfer pricing rules. Our business activities might inadvertently trigger taxing rights of foreign
countries (e.g., due to a representative’s permanent establishment), which could result in additional tax.

**_We are exposed to interest rate risks, and such rates may adversely affect our debt service obligations._**

A portion of our debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in
interest rates, primarily under Facility B and the Revolving Credit Facility, which are based on, in
respect of the Facility B and any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility in Euro, the Euro
Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (subject to a zero percent per annum floor) and in the case of
any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility in pounds-sterling or US dollars, the Sterling
Overnight Index Average ("SONIA") and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") (subject to
a zero percent per annum floor), respectively, and in each case plus an applicable margin. These interest
rates have significantly risen recently and could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest
expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and
hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes. Neither our Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor the Senior Notes Indenture contains a covenant
requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

**_Due to restrictions on the deductibility of interest expenses, we may be unable to fully deduct interest_**
**_expenses on our financial liabilities and expect to pay higher taxes._**

A certain amount of our annual financing expenses (primarily interest payments) is not deductible under
existing interest limitation rules, especially the German interest barrier rules (Zinsschranke) as further
described below. Subject to certain requirements, the German interest barrier rules impose restrictions
on the deductibility of interest expenses for German tax purposes. The German interest barrier rules
generally provide for a limitation on the deduction of net interest expenses in excess of 30% of taxadjusted EBITDA. For purposes of the interest barrier rules, all entities that are part of the same fiscal
unity (Organschaft) for corporate income and trade tax purposes are treated as one single business. Any
nondeductible amount exceeding the threshold of 30% is carried forward and may be, again subject to
the interest barrier rules, deductible in future financial years.

Furthermore, on June 20, 2016, the European Council adopted Directive (EU) 2016/1164, which
provides rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market.
The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive I (ATAD I) contains five legally binding anti-abuse measures, which
all member states have been required to apply against common forms of aggressive tax planning since
January 1, 2017. Part of the package of measures is the implementation of an interest limitation in line
with German rules. The restriction of the deductibility of interest expenses for tax purposes has adverse
consequences for our financial position and results of operations. The European Council has also
adopted Directive (EU) 2017/952 (ATAD II) targeted at mismatches which had to be implemented by
December 31, 2019. At the end of June 2021, the German legislator passed the ATAD Implementation
Act (Gesetz zur Umsetzung der Anti-Steuervermeidungsrichtline) in order to implement the respective
changes into German tax law. Amongst others, this act has introduced provisions to counter tax
shortfalls due to mismatches from the use of hybrid financial instruments or hybrid entities or due to
dual tax residency and has amended the CFC rules. These rules may result in higher taxable income and
a higher tax burden for corporate income tax and trade tax purposes in the past, current and future tax
periods. Further measures may follow as part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project.

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes._**

The Sponsors indirectly control the Group. See “Principal Shareholders and Related Party
_Transactions.” As a result, the Sponsors have, directly or indirectly, the power to affect, among other_
things, our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and


-----

change our management and to approve other changes to our operations. In addition, the Sponsors have
control over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and will have the ability to prevent
any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether our management
believes that any such transactions are in our own best interests. For example, the shareholders could
vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in
each case, so long as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional
indebtedness would increase our debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce our
ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect us. In addition, for compliance with
certain restrictive covenants, we will depend upon the cooperation of our principal shareholders who
have the power to effect compliance with such covenants. The interests of the Sponsors and their
affiliates could conflict with the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes, particularly if we
encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Affiliates of the Sponsors also
have an interest in pursuing divestitures, financings or other transactions (including one or more
divestitures of all or part of our business or sales of our shares which would result in changes to our
shareholding structure) that in their judgment could enhance their equity investments, although such
transactions might involve risks to holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the Sponsors or
their affiliates may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours or do business with
us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business
and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long as investment funds
associated with or designated by the Sponsors collectively continue to own a significant amount of our
capital stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, the Sponsors will continue to be able to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions.

**Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes**

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral that has_**
**_been granted as security for the Senior Secured Notes and future secured debt may be secured by_**
**_certain assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the Collateral described in
this Offering Memorandum. See “Description of the Notes—Security.” The Collateral will also secure
the liabilities owed to the creditors in respect of the Senior Facilities on an equal and ratable basis, and
may also secure certain hedging obligations and certain future indebtedness or guarantee obligations
ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent permitted by the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, and part of the Collateral also secures the
Senior Notes on a second priority basis. Therefore, in addition to the above, the rights of the holders
may be diluted by any increase in the pari passu debt secured by the Collateral, including an increase
in the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, or a reduction of the Collateral securing the
Senior Secured Notes. Also, in the event of enforcement of the Collateral, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the aggregate of the then outstanding claims under
obligations ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes are greater than the proceeds realized. In
addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the proceeds of an enforcement of the Collateral may
also be applied in repayment of any debt or guarantee obligations which are secured on a “Super Senior”
basis (to the extent the “Designation Date” (being the date on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
has first designated liabilities as “Super Senior” (under and as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement))
has occurred), followed by (or unless the Designation Date has not occurred) any creditors in respect of
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, certain other or future indebtedness or guarantee
obligations that are secured on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis.

To the extent the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes exceed the value of the Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees, those claims will generally rank equally with
the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured debt ranking pari passu with
the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as Collateral
is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, those claims may not be


-----

satisfied in full. In addition, not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to
secure certain types of debt permitted to be incurred under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with the
property and assets of the restricted subsidiaries that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes. The value
of such assets and property could be significant. If an event of default occurs and the obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes are accelerated, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will not benefit
from the assets securing such secured debt and will rank equally with the holders of other unsecured
debt of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and such Guarantors with respect to any property or assets that
is excluded from the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes or such secured debt.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our_**
**_obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such Collateral may be reduced, diluted or difficult_**
**_to enforce under certain circumstances._**

If we default on the Senior Secured Notes, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be secured only to
the extent of the value of the Collateral granted in favor of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. In the
event of an enforcement of the Collateral in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from the
sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, including due to the reasons described in
the preceding sentence. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with
this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the Collateral will also depend on many factors,
including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory
restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of
the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers.

The Collateral that is pledged for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide
for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of such Collateral may
not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure
you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the
liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses necessary to operate
our business may be revoked, the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or such
transfer may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that
the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits and licenses. If
the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically
prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result
and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Furthermore, enforcement of the
Collateral and any transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions, governmental or other
regulatory consents, approvals or filings or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or
filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed,
a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly
decreased. Not all of our assets will secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of
the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by the Collateral. With
respect to any shares of any Guarantors pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees
thereof, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
proceedings because all of the obligations of any such Guarantor must first be satisfied, leaving little or
no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of
a Guarantor may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value
of the Collateral may decline over time. If the proceeds of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all
amounts due on the Senior Secured Notes, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to the extent not
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only a senior unsecured,
unsubordinated claim against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ remaining assets.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also permits the granting of certain liens other than those in favor
of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other
indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the


-----

Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have
rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds
available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional
Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture or borrow additional amounts under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, holders of such Senior Secured Notes and lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement
would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Senior Secured Notes being offered hereby,
thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral.

In addition, CDPQ and OTPP, two of our Sponsors, are subject to laws restricting their ability to (i)
hold more than 30% of the voting rights with respect to the appointment or removal of directors of a
corporation or (ii) own more than 30% of any class of ordinary securities of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, respectively (together, the “30% Rule”). In order to assure compliance with the 30% Rule, the
first-ranking security interest over the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each Guarantor,
each securing the Senior Secured Notes, may be released to allow a transfer of the relevant number of
shares of each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each Guarantor to a designee (a “30% Rule
Designee”) of CDPQ or OTPP, as applicable, provided such shares are pledged by such 30% Rule
Designee in favor of the Senior Secured Notes. Similarly, in case of issuance of new shares of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor to a 30% Rule Designee, such 30% Rule Designee will be required
to pledge such shares in favor of the Senior Secured Notes. In case the 30% Rule is triggered, and
certain shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or any Guarantor are transferred or issued to, and
pledged by, a 30% Rule Designee, the Security Agent will be required, in the case of an enforcement
of the Collateral in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, to enforce such pledges separately from the
pledges provided by the Senior Notes Issuer over the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and by
the respective security provider over the shares of the respective Guarantor, in order to obtain control
of 100% of the share capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor, as applicable.
Enforcement of multiple security interests over the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Guarantor could result in a delay in the enforcement of such Collateral, increase costs related thereto
and hinder the ability of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to derive full benefit from the
applicable Collateral.

Further, the enforcement of the Collateral will be limited as set forth under “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations,”_
which limitations can be significant. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms_**
**_of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, creditors under the_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness_**
**_permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid with_**
**_proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to
the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The
Security Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent
from enforcement actions toward discharging any super senior obligations (including, among others,
(following the designation of the Revolving Credit Facility as a super senior liability in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) those under the Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
obligations and future indebtedness that may be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior
Liabilities”)) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes.
As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, you may not benefit from
such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the


-----

proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all
obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment
of the Senior Secured Notes (if the Revolving Credit Facility has not been designated as a super senior
liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement) the Revolving Credit Facility and
other Senior Facilities outstanding at such time, and any other indebtedness that ranks pari passu with
the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The Collateral may not initially secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees._**

The Security Documents existing as of the date of this Offering Memorandum purport to provide that
certain future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its affiliates which is designated
under the Intercreditor Agreement to be secured by the Collateral (including the Senior Secured Notes)
will be secured by the Collateral. Pursuant to applicable local law, such provisions may not be sufficient
to ensure that such future indebtedness (including the Senior Secured Notes) is in fact secured by the
Collateral. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may not be secured by the
Collateral until appropriate security confirmations and/or supplemental security interests are entered
into, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, within 120 days of the Issue Date.

**_Certain actions in respect of defaults taken under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by beneficial_**
**_owners with short positions in excess of their interests in the Senior Secured Notes will be_**
**_disregarded._**

By acceptance of the Senior Secured Notes, each holder of Senior Secured Notes agrees, in connection
with certain notices of Default (as defined under “Description of the Notes”), notices of acceleration or
instructions to the Trustee to provide certain notices of Default, notices of acceleration or take any other
action (a “Noteholder Direction”), to deliver a written representation to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Trustee that such holder and any of its affiliates acting in concert with it in connection with its
investment in the Senior Secured Notes (other than screened affiliates) are not (or, in the case such
holder is Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominee, that such holder is being instructed
solely by beneficial owners that (together with such affiliates) are not) Net Short (as defined under
“Description of the Notes”). Holders of the Senior Secured Notes, including holders that have hedged
their exposure to the Senior Secured Notes and/or other debt issued or guaranteed by the Group in the
ordinary course and not for speculative purposes, may not be able to make such representations. These
restrictions may impact a holder’s ability to participate in Noteholder Directions and exercise its rights.

**_The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening or_**
**_voidance periods for such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain_**
**_jurisdictions._**

The granting of the Guarantees and security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes may create
hardening or voidance periods for such Guarantees and security interests in certain jurisdictions. The
granting of shared security interests to secure future permitted debt may restart or reopen such hardening
or voidance periods in particular, because the Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the release and
retaking of security granted in favor of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in
connection with the incurrence of future debt. The applicable hardening or voidance period for these
new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected.
At each such time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the
respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or
ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

The same rights also apply following the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes in connection with the
accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests over
their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes, as
applicable.


-----

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral_**
**_may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests that will secure the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the
Senior Secured Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees thereof will not be
granted directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but to the Security Agent, and thus the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse
to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the relevant Security
Documents except through the Security Agent as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting
a Note, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders
of the Senior Secured Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against us in the event of a default.
See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

In addition, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the security interests is subject to mandatory
provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the Collateral are taken. For
example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for the appropriation of certain pledged assets,
but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some
uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the
Senior Secured Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly
secured. In Germany, due to the laws and other jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of
security interests and the enforceability of such security interests, the Intercreditor Agreement will
provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (“Parallel Debt”)
mirroring the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors owed to holders of the
Senior Secured Notes under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“Principal
Obligations”). All or part of the pledges and other security interests in Germany will be granted to the
Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal
Obligations. Under the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Parallel Debt will be at all times
in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the
security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not
have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such
security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
will bear the risk of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt
construct has not been tested under German law and to the extent that the security interests in the
Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are
successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not receive any
proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on Validity
_and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations.”_

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral held_**
**_by the Security Agent._**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will act only as provided for therein. The
Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing
Group. For the purposes of enforcement, “Instructing Group” means, in the context of our capital
structure upon the consummation of the Transactions, more than 50% by value of the total senior
secured credit participations under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities, certain hedge
counterparties at that time, and any other additional pari passu indebtedness that may be secured on
such Collateral (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”). The Majority Senior Secured Creditors may
have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may,
subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security
Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to


-----

do so. The constitution of the “Instructing Group” for these purposes may change if our capital structure
changes. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Notes—Security.”_

**_Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the_**
**_Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party or the grantor
of the security, as applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes may not be
perfected with respect to the claims of the Senior Secured Notes if we fail or are unable to take the
actions necessary to perfect any of these liens. Under German law, the creation of a valid security
interest under a German law governed pledge agreement in relation to certain assets may be subject to
the delivery of a notice of pledge by the security agent or the security provider to a third party. Any
failure to perfect any security interest in the Collateral may result in the invalidity of the relevant
security interest or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Senior Secured
Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security
interest in the same Collateral. The Trustee and the Security Agent will not be under any obligation or
responsibility to take any steps or action to perfect, or ensure the perfection of, security interests in the
Senior Secured Notes.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under_**
**_which the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released automatically without your_**
**_consent or the Trustee or the Security Agent obtaining your further consent._**

Under a variety of circumstances, the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released
automatically, including a sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction that does
not violate the asset sale covenant of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or in connection with an
enforcement sale permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will also permit us to designate one or more restricted subsidiaries that are Guarantors as unrestricted
subsidiaries. If we designate a Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, all the liens on the Collateral owned by such subsidiary and any guarantees
of the Senior Secured Notes by such subsidiary will be released under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, subject to certain conditions. Designation of an unrestricted subsidiary as such will reduce
the aggregate value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of liens securing
the shares of such unrestricted subsidiary or of its subsidiaries.

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor,
obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value
of the obligations secured by such security.

Finally, if the secured obligations are exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory
security interest created pursuant to a Security Document governed by German law might be released
as a matter of German law.

**_The insolvency and restructuring laws of Germany may not be as favorable to you as the insolvency_**
**_and restructuring laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you are_**
**_familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral, including_**
**_fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability._**

On and after the Issue Date, as applicable, our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes will be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantors and secured by security interests over the Collateral. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. There is a rebuttable
presumption that the “centre of main interests” as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast) is the


-----

jurisdiction where the registered office is situated. In addition, the Collateral will include a first-ranking
pledge over the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors.

In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, administration or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated
in Germany. In this case, in general, your rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and
the Collateral are likely to be subject to the insolvency and administrative laws of Germany. The
insolvency, administration and other laws of Germany may be materially different from, or conflict
with, the laws of the United States, including in the areas at rights of creditors, priority of governmental
and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest, the duration of proceeding and preference
periods.

Although laws differ by jurisdiction, in general applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and
equitable principles, insolvency and restructuring laws and limitations on the enforceability of
judgments obtained in courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Senior Secured
Notes against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor
and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may
also void the security interests in the Collateral or the Guarantee granted by a company being close to
or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law,
although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the
relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes.

In insolvency proceedings, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency
administrator may challenge the Guarantees and the security interests, and intercompany obligations
generally, as preferences, transactions at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to:

- void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the
security interests provided by such security provider;

- direct that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes return
any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security interest to the relevant Guarantor or
security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors;
and

- take other action that is detrimental to you.

If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and any Guarantee or security
interest in the Collateral is found to be a preference, transaction at an undervalue, fraudulent transfer or
conveyance or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security
provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in
such Guarantee or security interest not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate
distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantors and security
providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to
what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There
is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the
entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts
would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests
created, the Guarantor or security provider:


-----

- issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or
defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others, or
created such security after its insolvency;

- issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business
person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity
to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or
security interest in the Collateral knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security
provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; or

- received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the
Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interests were incurred
for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some
other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the
Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other
reasons; (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the
Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small; or (iii) intended to incur, or
believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they
would become due.

Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider
generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or
created any security interest if:

- its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets (in certain jurisdictions based on their
liquidation value);

- it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or

- the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing
debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become
absolute.

Although we believe that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the Group are solvent,
and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a
court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the
date the Guarantees were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method
of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that
date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider
was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that payments
to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds.

For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantees
and security interests in the Collateral, see “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security
_Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees_**
**_and the Collateral._**

The Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany. Enforcement of the obligations under a
Guarantee against, and/or any Collateral provided by (as applicable) any such Guarantor will be subject
to certain defenses available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as the case
may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance or similar laws as well as
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally, particularly by limiting the amounts


-----

recoverable under the Guarantees and Collateral (as applicable) and the amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor or
security provider under the applicable laws of each jurisdiction, to the extent that the granting of such
Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s or security provider’s corporate interests, or
the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor or security
provider, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, liquidity
maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the
directors of such subsidiary Guarantor or security provider to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur
civil or criminal liability.

Guarantees and/or security interests granted by a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbH”) for the purpose of guaranteeing or securing liabilities of its direct or_
indirect shareholders or a subsidiary of such shareholders (excluding direct or indirect subsidiaries of
such GmbH) are considered to constitute a benefit for such shareholder and therefore are subject to
certain capital maintenance and liquidity maintenance rules. Therefore, any Guarantees and/or
Collateral provided by a GmbH, including by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors, will be subject to certain contractual limitations (“limitation language”) contained
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or any other document under which any Guarantee is granted)
and Security Documents, respectively, designed to ensure compliance with applicable capital
maintenance, liquidity maintenance or any other general statutory laws.

Similarly, any guarantee and/or security interest granted by a GmbH may be held invalid pursuant to
Section 138 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) (“BGB”) and would therefore not be
enforceable if, at the time of the creation or enforcement of any such guarantee and/or security interest,
among other things, the third-party creditor and the affiliate have committed a fraudulent conveyance
(kollusives Zusammenwirken) to the detriment of the GmbH or other third-party creditors of the GmbH.

These provisions would also apply to any Guarantor in the form of a limited partnership
(Kommanditgesellschaft) with a limited liability company as its only general partner (“GmbH & Co.
KG”).

As a result, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s or the Senior Notes Issuer’s liability
under its Guarantee or Collateral (as applicable) could be materially reduced or eliminated, depending
upon the law and contractual enforcement restrictions applicable to it. This could lead to a situation in
which such Guarantee or Collateral cannot be enforced at all. It is possible that a Guarantor or security
provider, or any of their creditors, or the bankruptcy trustee or other insolvency office holder in the case
of a bankruptcy or insolvency of a Guarantor or security provider, may contest the validity and
enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee or the Senior Notes Issuer’s Collateral on any of the above
grounds and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or Collateral should be limited
or voided. To the extent that any limitations on the relevant Guarantees or Collateral apply, the Senior
Secured Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor or security provider, including trade payables of such Guarantor or security provider. Future
Guarantees and Collateral may be subject to similar limitations. See “Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes._**

Because the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been, and will not be, and are not
required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction,
they may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A,
outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another
exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Senior
Secured Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Senior Secured Notes to ensure that all offers and


-----

sales of the Senior Secured Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable
securities laws. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely_**
**_on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

The Senior Secured Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Interests in the global Senior Secured Notes will trade in book-entry form only, and Senior Secured
Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes (as defined herein),
will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Senior Secured Notes. The common
depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global
notes representing the Senior Secured Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing
on or in respect of the global notes representing the Senior Secured Notes will be made to the Paying
Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be
credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the
Senior Secured Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to
Euroclear and Clearstream, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for
the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly,
if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of
the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder
of the Senior Secured Notes under the Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Senior Secured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have
the direct right to act upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for
waivers or other actions from holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a bookentry interest, it will be permitted to act only to the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so
from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. The procedures implemented for
the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless
and until Definitive Registered Senior Secured Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if
investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream.
The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure
the timely exercise of rights under the Senior Secured Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability_**
**_to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Senior Secured Notes;

- your ability to sell your Senior Secured Notes; or

- the prices at which you would be able to sell your Senior Secured Notes.

Future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other
things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity
of a trading market for the Senior Secured Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the
market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the
Senior Secured Notes. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Senior


-----

Secured Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. The Initial Purchasers have
advised that they intend to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes after completing the Offering.
However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time
without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the
U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active
trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able
to resell your Senior Secured Notes at a fair value, if at all.

**_The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the claims of_**
**_creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders_** (if any), of our non**_Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred stockholders (if any)
of non-Guarantor subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, are entitled to payments of their
claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to
their respective parent entity or the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors.
Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part
of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors (including the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such non-Guarantor
subsidiary; and

- creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary, including depositors, trade creditors and preferred
stockholders (if any) will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal
of the assets of such subsidiary before the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor, as a
direct or indirect shareholder (as applicable), will be entitled to receive any distributions from
such subsidiary.

As such, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors,
including depositors, trade creditors and any preferred stockholders (if any) of the non-Guarantor
subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. As of December 31, 2023, on an as adjusted basis to
give effect to the Transactions, our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Senior Secured Notes had
indebtedness of €2.4 million (excluding intercompany loans). This amount will rank structurally senior
to the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will, subject to certain limitations, permit these nonGuarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial additional indebtedness without such incurrence constituting
a default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and such indebtedness may also be secured. The
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain any limitation on the amount of other liabilities, such
as deposits and trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

**_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are organized or incorporated outside the United
States, and their business is substantially conducted outside the United States. The directors and
executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are non-residents of, and
substantially all of their assets are located outside the United States. Although the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with
any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United
States on the directors and executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors. In
addition, because substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors
and their subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside the United
States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, in light
of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the


-----

Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United
States.

Additionally, there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of foreign jurisdictions would enforce (i)
judgments of U.S. courts obtained against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the
directors and executive officers who are not residents of the United States predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of U.S. federal and state securities laws or (ii) in original actions brought in such
foreign jurisdictions against us or such persons predicated upon U.S. federal and state securities laws.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters, with
Germany. For further information, see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon a_**
**_change of control. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may_**
**_have the right to purchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes in connection with a tender offer,_**
**_even if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) occurs, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to make an offer to purchase all the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. In such a situation, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Senior Secured Notes that
are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Senior Secured Notes is tendered,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will likely have to obtain financing to pay for the tendered Senior
Secured Notes. However, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be able to obtain such financing on
acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control may also result in a mandatory prepayment under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and agreements governing any future indebtedness, and may result in the
acceleration of such indebtedness. Any failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to purchase
the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control would constitute a default under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The change of control provision contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may not necessarily
afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations,
restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely
affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial
ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be
deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a certain consolidated
net leverage ratio of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met. For a complete
description of events that would constitute a change of control under the Senior Secured Notes, see
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Senior Secured Notes, if holders of not less
than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do
not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or
any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases, all of
the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding
in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other
holder of Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”


-----

**_If the Senior Secured Notes are redeemed early, an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds_**
**_in a comparable security._**

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes are redeemed early in accordance with “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption” and depending on prevailing market conditions at the time, an investor_
who receives proceeds due to such an early redemption may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a
comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that carried by the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established_**
**_meaning under relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain_**
**_that a change of control has occurred or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control triggering event under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to make an offer to
repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes tendered. The definition of “change of control” in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (taken as
a whole), to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or
substantially all,” it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts
and circumstances of the subject transaction, and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular
transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and
therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control triggering event has occurred and whether the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes.

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes.
The credit ratings address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes and credit risks in determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the
Senior Secured Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the
structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of
the Senior Secured Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and
may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance
can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances
in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned
to the Senior Secured Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost,
terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Senior
Secured Notes.

**_Certain covenants and events of default will be suspended if we receive investment-grade ratings._**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
receive an investment-grade rating from two of Moody’s, S&P and Fitch, and no default or event of
default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day and continuing until such time as the
Senior Secured Notes are no longer rated investment grade by at least two rating agencies, certain
covenants will cease to be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status.” At any_
time when these covenants are suspended, we will be able to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, pay cash dividends and redeem subordinated indebtedness without restriction, each of
which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. There can be no assurance
that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve an investment-grade rating or that any such rating if
achieved will be maintained.


-----

**_The Senior Secured Notes may not become or remain listed on the Official List of the Exchange._**

Application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the Senior Secured
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes
will become or remain listed. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the
Exchange and the admission to dealing on the Official List thereof, or if it becomes unduly burdensome
to make or maintain such listing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may cease to make or maintain such
listing on the Official List of the Exchange. Listing of any of the Senior Secured Notes on the Exchange
does not imply that a public offering of any of the Senior Secured Notes in the Channel Islands has been
authorized. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes as a result of
listing on the Official List of the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for comparable
issuers, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Senior Secured Notes from the Official
List of the Exchange or another listing exchange may have an adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
resell Senior Secured Notes in the secondary market.

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks or other tax consequences as a result of investing in_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an
investment in the Senior Secured Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other
factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of
economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against
the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Senior Secured Notes below their
stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a U.S. dollar basis. Investing in the Senior
Secured Notes by U.S. investors may have other significant tax consequences. See “Tax
_Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations.”_

**Overview**

We are a leading digitally driven energy services provider for the real estate sector in Europe with a
strong track record of managing complexity for our customers. This stems from our historically strong
business in submetering as well as significant offerings in energy contracting and other building and
energy related services. We are active in 18 countries, all located in Europe except for Brazil, and hold
top one or top two positions in most of these countries. We believe we are a leading provider in the
European energy services market, in particular in the residential submetering market in Germany where
we believe to have a relative market share of approximately 27% based on revenue for the financial
year ended September 30, 2022, and the largest installed asset base of heat and water meter devices.
While our business is not regulated, it is supported by the regulatory framework our customers face and
we see ourselves as their service provider to help them fulfill growing regulatory requirements.

We organize our business into the two reportable segments: Energy Services, which offers submetering
and cost allocation services, ancillary energy efficiency solutions and supplementary products and
services, and Energy Efficiency Solutions, where we procure, convert and supply energy to our
customers. Energy Services consists of the business operating lines Energy Services Germany and
Energy Services International, which oversees the development and strategy across 17 countries. All of
these countries are located in Europe, with the exception of Brazil. For the twelve months ended


-----

December 31, 2023, our Energy Services business segment generated external revenues of €863.8
million. Germany generated 61.0% of these revenues, with the remainder generated by our operations
outside Germany. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, our Energy Efficiency Solutions
business segment generated external revenues of €148.6 million.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

Factors affecting our results of operations include the following:

**_Demand and prices for our devices and services_**

The volume of revenue we generate generally depends, among other factors, on the demand for our
devices and services, as well as our prices for those devices and services. We believe the nature of our
business and the industry in which we operate provides inherent stability and resilience in economic
downturns or volatility. Our services are provided to landlords (owner of the apartments) for their
respective tenants. Regulation is only applicable for the landlords’ rental of apartments to tenants and
not to our service, which makes our services essential.

In Germany, we benefit from long-term and established customer relationships, with some customer
relationships lasting for significantly more than 20 years, and occasionally customer relationships for
more than 40 years. The duration of our typical customer contract in Energy Services varies among the
types of business, equipment used and customer segment. For example, for rental services, some of our
contracts rely on the legally required replacement cycles, which amount to ten years for smoke detectors
and six years for water and heat meters, while for other contracts there are no legally binding
replacement cycles, such as for heat cost allocators, which typically have a contract duration of ten or
more years. The duration of our typical customer contract in Energy Efficiency Solutions is between 15
and 20 years. Long-term contracts are both attractive for our customers and provide relatively high
visibility for us on the revenue generation over the next years. Since our customers are primarily
landlords and property managers of multi-unit residential and commercial buildings, the revenue we
generate also depends on the total number of such buildings in a relevant market, the number of units
that are equipped or can be equipped with devices, the average number of devices per building and the
number of related services we provide. For example, demand for our devices generally increases as a
result of new construction, but may also decrease as a result of the demolition of apartment buildings,
such as happened in the former Eastern German federal states. We anticipate intrinsic growth of the
total number of dwellings in the EU to be approximately 1% per year. In addition, increasing regulatory
requirements, e.g., intra-year reading, CO2 tax allocation are expected to lead to additional revenue
generation and positively impact our business and do not depend on an increasing building stock. We
also believe that higher energy prices and the CO2 tax, shared between landlords and tenants, will drive
demand for our products as awareness on energy costs and CO2 footprint increases.

In mature, international markets such as Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and
Denmark, where cost allocation penetration is similar to the German market, demand is typically
determined by drivers similar to those in Germany. Revenue generation in these developed markets,
which amounted to €118.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021 and grew to €142.3
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023, is therefore expected to be positively impacted
by the offering of higher valued and priced services on the basis of the already installed base of remotely
and or cloud connected devices. In other international markets where cost allocation penetration is lower
and the industry is less established, the most important drivers of demand are the number of buildings
that can be equipped with devices and the cooperation of utility providers and potential customers to
adhere to legal requirements for submetering. In these developing markets, specifically France, Poland
and Spain, revenue amounted to €43.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021 and grew
to €57.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023. The opportunities for the largest growth
exist in markets with both a large base of multi-unit residential buildings and low penetration rates,
whereas areas with lower number of multi-unit buildings or where central heating systems are less
prevalent offer comparably smaller growth opportunities.


-----

The number of installed submetering devices has grown from 62.0 million devices as of September 30,
2021 to 66.7 million devices as of September 30, 2023, driving an implied reading and billing services
revenue per dwelling in Germany of €50.50 and internationally of €16.10 as of September 30, 2023
(reading and billing services revenue divided by number of dwellings) and implied rental and associated
service revenue per device in Germany (excluding DMG) of €6.58 as of September 30, 2023 (rental
contract value divided by number of rental devices).

Demand for services has grown significantly in recent years as complexity within the industry has
increased, leading us to develop innovative solutions and to implement more digitization within our
business and automation within our devices. There has been a shift from mechanical (evaporator) and
simple electronic devices to more sophisticated and efficient radio-enabled devices due to technological
advancements, demand from tenants for a more efficient, less intrusive and more accurate meter reading
process, and regulation in Germany. Monthly consumption information enforced by the EED for all
dwellings by Jan 1, 2027, at the latest, requires cloud-enabled data gathering to ensure cost-efficient
services (instead of a physical reading once a year). The rental and sales prices we charge for our devices
depend on the technology utilized in the device. For example, we charge higher prices for radio-enabled
devices than for mechanical or electronic devices. Outside Germany, our service prices are also
typically increased in line with consumer prices. Service prices are reviewed and in general adjusted on
a yearly basis primarily following the movement of consumer prices, the cost of labor as well as the
inclusion of incremental services. We believe our ability to meet demands of customers and tenants for
more digitization has in turn led to more loyalty among customers as well as opportunities for greater
revenue streams from more accurate and even more timely delivery of services. We also believe new
services, in particular MPO, DHC control, EV Charging and smoke detection and climate monitoring
(MSD — which builds upon our long established smoke detection business with more than 10 million
devices installed and with replacement cycles upcoming) in Germany.

**_Social, political and regulatory developments_**

In certain European countries, there is increased public awareness of the need for and political intention
to implement energy-saving measures and CO2-reduction measures, both in business as well as in
private life. Higher prices for energy and water encourage consumers to reduce energy and water
consumption and to stay informed of energy costs related to their housing. High energy prices
incentivize consumers to demand cost allocation metering services and to pay only for their own energy
consumption.

These social developments are supported by favorable regulatory developments. In Germany, for
example, several regulations have supported the development of submetering and cost allocation since
as early as 1981. For instance, pursuant to the 1981 German Heating Cost Ordinance
(Heizkostenverordnung), the owner of a multi-unit residential or commercial building with a central
heating source or commercially supplied heat or hot water is required to measure and bill heating and
hot water based on individual consumption by the end-user. At the same time, applicable tenancy laws
allow for a landlord to pass on submetering costs to tenants. In addition, the building codes
(Landesbauordnungen) of most German federal states also provide for an obligation to measure the
consumption of cold water in residential units, at least with respect to new buildings. More recently, the
German Act to Restart the Digitisation of the Energy Transition (Gesetz zum Neustart der
_Digitalisierung der Energiewende) enacted in 2023 aims to support an unbureaucratic and speedy_
rollout of smart (electricity) meters and smart meter gateways throughout Germany.

In addition, we believe that globally there is increased legislation aimed at saving energy. Under the
Paris Agreement, the EU and its Member States are committed to a 40% target reduction in CO2emissions throughout the EU by 2030 (compared to 1990). In addition to the legislation and regulations
already in place in certain European countries, the EU Parliament adopted and published the Energy
Efficiency Directive (the “EED”) in 2012, which imposes an obligation to provide end-users with
individual submeters that accurately measure and report their energy consumption, provide actual
consumption information at least quarterly and ensure that billing is accurate and based on actual


-----

consumption. On December 24, 2018, a revised version of the EED became effective. This was followed
by a further revision published in September 2023 (together with the December 24, 2018 amending
directive, the “Revised EED”), which came into force on October 10, 2023, offering new opportunities
for increased penetration of radio-controlled devices and increased availability of intra-annual
consumption and billing data to be made available. The Revised EED mandates, among other things,
that (i) all (existing and new) installed metering and cost allocation devices for heating, cooling and
domestic hot water are remotely readable by January 1, 2027, with all newly installed devices to be
remotely readable since October 25, 2020, and (ii) consumption data for radio-controlled devices be
made available at least monthly since January 1, 2022. In Germany, the further requirements of the
Revised EED 2023 have been implemented by an amendment to the Heating Costs Ordinance with
effect from October 16, 2023.

While other EU Member States have implemented the EED (especially the submetering requirements)
at different times and not all have complied with the official transposition dates (June 5, 2014 for the
EED and October 25, 2020 for the Revised EED), certain key aspects have been reflected in recent
legislation, or are expected to be reflected in legislation in the near future, in some of the key countries
we operate in. For example, in Italy, the submetering of certain buildings became mandatory on June
30, 2017, though penalties for non-compliance are not regularly enforced. In France, submetering of
certain buildings became mandatory on January 1, 2018 and EED legislation with an acceptable
threshold for apartments which have a low energy consumption is currently pending, following an
objection raised by the social housing organization. In Spain, the EED has been approved by the
government in August 2020, with installation deadlines varying by climatic area and ranging up until
April 30, 2023. In Poland, a new EED legislation was signed in April 2021, followed by a consultation
process to outline the detailed requirements in a decree which was completed in December 2021.
However, the timing of legislative processes and speed of implementation in these and other countries
may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other socio-economic factors. We expect that
the directive and the proposed revisions, if fully implemented, will have a favorable impact on our cost
allocation business in less- or non-penetrated countries within the EU.

More recently, based on the recommendations of the Expert Commission on Gas and Heat, which
proposed a one-time payment in December as an emergency relief for gas and heat customers, the
Bundestag passed a bill for this emergency relief in December 2022 on November 10, 2022, which
entered into force on November 19, 2022 (Natural Gas and Heat Emergency Relief Act, “EWSG”). The
EWSG regulates the one-time relief of costs for natural gas and heat for end consumers for the month
of December 2022. This relief granted to the landlord must be passed on by the landlord to his tenants,
which will primarily take place in the context of the annual heating cost billing prepared by the Group.

Further, on January 1, 2023, a new regulation for the allocation of CO2-costs between tenants and
landlords and to increase incentives for energy-efficient renovations came into force which we believe
will have a positive impact on our business. In future, the allocation of CO2-costs will generally be
shown in the heating cost billing prepared by Techem.

Also, on January 1, 2023, the German Gas/Heat Price Brake Act entered into force, including a cap of
gas and heat prices at 12 cents and 9.5 cents, respectively, gross per kilowatt-hour from March 2023 to
April 2024 for private households, small and medium-sized enterprises with gas consumption of less
than 1.5 million kWh per year, for 80 percent of annual consumption from the previous year. The price
brake for natural gas and heat is to apply from March 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024. In March, the relief
amounts for January and February 2023 were applied retroactively These regulations have been
implemented and are taken into account in the heating cost billing prepared by the Group.

The regulatory environment also affects our Energy Efficiency Solutions business. For example,
Germany provides certain tax incentives for energy contracting companies that are also manufacturing
companies and the EU is actively encouraging energy contracting solutions for conserving energy. We
focus our attention on our core Energy Efficiency Solutions product, System Contracting.


-----

Furthermore, the Federal Council of Germany adopted an amendment of the German Civil Code
concerning the law of tenancy (Mietrechtsänderungsgesetz), pursuant to which as of July 1, 2013,
landlords can transition more easily from the self-supply of heating and warm water to the supply from
energy service providers such as Techem, although strict conditions must be met (for example, cost
neutrality for the tenant and improved energy efficiency). We have adjusted our System Contracting
product range to this legislation.

To further digitalize the energy transition in Germany, the Metering Point Operation Act
(Messstellenbetriebsgesetz), which was introduced in 2016 and last amended in 2021, has created a
central framework for the use of intelligent metering systems. The aim of the law is to achieve an
extensive, nationwide rollout of smart meter gateways to which all commodity inflows into a property
need to be digitally connected (district heat, electric power and gas). The Metering Point Operation Act
as well as numerous further obligations in other laws such as the Renewable Energy Act (Erneuerbare_Energien-Gesetz) or Combined Heat and Power Act (Kraft-Wärme-Kopplungsgesetz) lead to the further_
mandatory installation of smart meter gateways in real estate. The installation of photovoltaic systems
or combined heat and power systems or electric vehicle charging systems all demand Metering Point
Operations services based on Smart Meter Gateways, from which we benefit as a competitive Metering
Point Operator for our real estate customers.

In further support of energy efficiency solutions, the Building Electric Mobility Infrastructure Act
(Gebäude-Elektromobilitätsinfrastruktur-Gesetz) has provided for the installation of charging stations
in the building sector under certain conditions since 2021.

Also, the aforementioned EWSG as well as the German Gas/Heat Price Brake Act which came into
force on November 19, 2022 and January 1, 2023, respectively, also apply to our Energy Efficiency
Solutions business in those cases in which we provide natural gas / heat to customers as described
above.

Changes in the application of tax laws also affect our results of operations. For example, the elimination
of tax loss carry forwards and the new application of the interest barrier rule, in each case, as a result of
the change of ownership which occurred in July 2018, result in increased tax payments in the financial
year ended September 30, 2021 (including retroactive and advance payments) for the Group.

**_Innovation_**

Product and service innovation is an important factor in the business environment in which we operate,
and has become even more critical as regulation, environmental concerns, and tenant driven demands
for transparency around consumption and costs have created more complexity within the industry. We
strive to stay ahead of the curve, using technology and innovation to improve on time delivery and
accuracy of readings. For example, we were the first to introduce radio-enabled technologies to the
market on a large scale and as of the end of the financial year ended September 30, 2023, 82.0% of
devices (including smoke detectors) were radio-enabled (compared to 76.1% as of September 2019)
and 59.7% of devices (including smoke detectors) were cloud connected (compared to 11.0% as of
September 2019), providing fully remote readable properties. Since bringing radio-enabled
technologies to the market and building them into devices, we have seen growing demand for such
radio-enabled devices. Additionally, we are able to offer our energy efficiency and safety solutions to
customers using such devices.

We believe that, with the range and quality of our products and services, we are highly competitive in
the market. In 2020, we successfully initiated the roll-out of our smart readers which are intended to
increase the amount of devices readable via our Techem Fixed Network. As of September 30, 2023,
82.0% of our devices were radio-enabled and 59.7% were cloud connected. More recently, we
introduced fully digitalized services which utilize the existing installed base of remote cloud connected
devices (such as monthly consumption information in order to fulfill regulatory obligations of our
customers based on the EED). We also implemented a real-time heat cost allocation billing service


-----

which can reduce lead times to approximately 10 minutes per billing cycle, an additional service for
which we see customers willing to pay. Furthermore, we implemented a new smoke detection service
option by changing the test frequency per device from once per year to two times a month, increasing
safety for tenants and landlords and allowing us to increase our service offering. In addition, our DHC
service provides 24/7 monitoring of central heating systems, enabling our customers to adjust the
parameters of the central heating system and reduce energy consumption.

We continue to invest in developing and innovating products and services to improve customer and
tenant satisfaction. We believe these innovations contribute to lower churn levels (less than 3% in the
financial year ended September 30, 2023) as well as higher revenue per customer.

In the financial years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, research and development costs
amounted to €22.1 million (thereof €19.6 million personnel expenses), €20.4 million (thereof €17.9
million personnel expenses), and €17.7 million (thereof €15.7 million personnel expenses),
respectively. Our primary innovation focus is currently on the development of the smoke detection and
climate monitoring service, DHC services, EV Charging and MPO.

**_Competition and price pressure_**

Our businesses are subject to strong competition with over 350 competitors in the German submetering
market alone. However, in our cost allocation business, entry into the market for new competitors is
cost intensive and customers are party to long-term contracts, resulting in a relatively stable market
position for us. In our Energy Efficiency Solutions business, the market in Germany is characterized by
many service providers, of which we are one of the larger independent companies not affiliated with a
local utility or an equipment provider. Our Energy Efficiency Solutions business is primarily focused
on the residential market in order to leverage our existing customer relationships in Energy Services. In
the commercial clients market, some of our competitors with ancillary business interests, such as the
provision of primary energy or equipment, offer their services at very low margins in order to protect
existing customer relationships. We also offer energy services to supply multi-unit commercial
buildings with energy (mainly heating, cooling and electricity) that focus on energy and cost efficiency.

While the market is largely fragmented, we believe we are well-suited to take a large portion of market
share given the sophistication and breadth of our products and services platform. Many customers,
particularly the largest and most sophisticated customers in a market, do not have single-sourcing
strategies for submetering. We must compete within a tender process, often facing meter consultants
and other procurement professionals. Such tender processes generally result in these large customers
splitting their contracts between us and some of our largest competitors, potentially at more attractive
terms than they would receive if they had only approached a single supplier. Deciding factors in the
competitive landscape we operate in and which can influence customer decisions include service
delivery, time, price and similar factors.

**_Value creation initiatives_**

We have ongoing initiatives to enhance our operational and financial performance. As an umbrella for
all of our key transformational activities, we launched our Group-wide value creation program
_ENERGIZE-T in 2018._ _ENERGIZE-T comprises various strategic initiatives to add value to our_
operational and commercial processes. Our initiatives are centered around quality and performance
resulting in enhanced customer experience, automation and digitalization, and accelerated growth. From
its start in 2019, ENERGIZE-T has been responsible for an EBITDA impact of approximately €94.0
million during the period until September 30, 2023. The respective non-revenue / pricing related effects
thereby are evaluated every financial closing to be realized within the following 24 months. With that,
as of September 30, 2021, an impact of €30 million EBITDA and as of September 30, 2022, around
€24 million have been determined and measured. In the year ended September 30, 2023, we additionally
incurred costs for a personnel alignment of €29.0 million which we expect to return a double digit (midteens) euro million amount in annual savings from 2024.


-----

Based on an end-to-end view along the entire value chain a new target operating model is designed to
significantly enhance customer experience and bring process efficiencies to the next performance level
and consequently drive our core business to full digitization. The customer experience will be improved
and simplified through digital submetering services supported by portal and online solutions, as well as
through the interlinking of all communication channels. We believe the increased use of agile working
methods and a clear customer orientation create the framework for the cultural change to a digital
service provider. In addition, the comprehensive conversion of the infrastructure to wireless sensors
and smart readers in connection with modern cloud technology makes it possible to expand the use of
our modern measurement and control technology to increase energy efficiency and avoid CO2emissions. The connection to our IT platform enables us to process business transactions for and with
our customers efficiently and without errors. With the process improvements in the core business and
our new infrastructure, we intend to create the conditions for a growth path in all of our existing business
areas and for new products and services.

A result-oriented allocation of capital and resources is ensured by consistently aligning projects with
current and future customer needs. The Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) has improved over the past 24
months: We are above the industry average in the private customer segment. In addition, customers
even confirm the high quality of our services provided digitally (quality, speed, benefits and userfriendliness as well as new digital value-added offerings) with an NPS that is higher compared to users
who still choose the classic path.

**_Acquisitions and dispositions_**

Since 2020, we have acquired 31 businesses (thereof 27 in Germany and four elsewhere) related to the
reading of consumption-based energy and water devices as well as the rental and the sale of the
respective devices. Our results, most notably revenue, are impacted by acquisitions, as well as
dispositions. In addition, our level of indebtedness has historically been impacted as a result of
acquisitions. Our acquisitions are generally small, typically ranging between €1 million and €5 million,
and have lower operating and EBITDA margins than our existing business. The acquisitions we have
made since October 1, 2020 are mainly held by our subsidiary DMG and have contributed €39.4 million
in aggregate additional revenue and €14.8 million in aggregate additional EBITDA in the twelve months
ended December 31, 2023 compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2021. DMG’s EBITDA
margin in the financial years ended September 30, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023 was 32.3%, 39.1%, 36.6% and 36.7%, respectively.

In the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we acquired 11 businesses (nine thereof in Germany)
and disposed of one business. If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of our Group
since January 1, 2023, Group revenues would have amounted to €1,019.0 million and Group net loss to
€65.3 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. If the acquired companies and businesses
had been part of our Group since January 1, 2023, their EBITDA contribution would have amounted to
€11.1 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Since joining the Group, the acquisitions
have contributed €6.2 million of EBITDA in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023.

In the financial year ended September 30, 2022, we acquired 12 businesses. If the acquired companies
and businesses had been part of our Group since October 1, 2021, Group revenues would have
amounted to €903.4 million and Group net loss to €14.3 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2022. Since joining the Group, the acquisitions generated total revenues of €7.6 million
and total net loss of €0.9 million in the year ended September 30, 2022 (thereof €1.7 million revenues
and €0.2 million net loss of SANNcompact GmbH as well as €0.3 million revenues and €0.1 million
net loss of Ditschun Wärmemeßtechnik GmbH). In the financial year ended September 30, 2022, costs
directly attributable to the acquisitions amounted to €0.9 million, which were recognized in other
expenses. If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of our Group since October 1, 2021,
their EBITDA contribution would have amounted to €8.2 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2022. Since joining the Group, the acquisitions have contributed to EBITDA in the
amount of €1.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022.


-----

In the financial year ended September 30, 2021, we acquired eight businesses. If the acquired
companies and businesses had been part of our Group since October 1, 2020, Group revenues would
have amounted to €821.3 million and Group net loss to €82.8 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021. Since joining the Group, the acquisitions generated total revenues of €4.6 million
and total net loss of €0.1 million in the year ended September 30, 2021. In the financial year ended
September 30, 2021, costs directly attributable to the acquisitions amounted to €0.3 million, which were
recognized as other expenses. If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of our Group
since October 1, 2020, their EBITDA contribution would have amounted to €2.9 million in the financial
year ended September 30, 2021. Since joining the Group, the acquisitions have contributed to EBITDA
in the amount of €0.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021.

**_Seasonality_**

We experience seasonality in our business, with the first quarter of the financial year being the weakest
and the second quarter generally the strongest in terms of revenue and earnings contribution.

In our Energy Services segment, a major part of our revenue is derived from equipment rental,
maintenance and reading and billing agreements. In general, these services are invoiced once a year,
leading to the recognition of billed receivables. Revenue from rental and maintenance agreements is
accrued or deferred (depending on whether these are invoiced in arrears or in advance, respectively)
and recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. Revenue from reading
and billing services is recognized with respect to the services already rendered using the percentage-ofcompletion method. Most of our reading and billing activity occurs during the winter months because
December 31 is the most popular annual determination date for submetering data. Therefore, most of
the billing revenue is recognized between January and April according to the progress of the completion
of meter reading and billing activities. Our invoices are usually paid within 30 days. Similarly, our


-----

Working Capital pattern is linked to this annual cycle. We expect the annual billing cycle to remain the
strongest, despite monthly readings becoming more common.

Our business experiences regular fluctuations in revenues as described above, but we believe is
impacted only tangentially by external macro events, for example the COVID-19 pandemic or recent
military conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we voluntarily
delayed installations for a very short period, but were able to overcompensate for the decrease in
revenue within the same financial year. With regards to knock-on effects from the military conflicts
between Ukraine and Russia, energy prices increased, which only affects our Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment whereas these increases were passed through to the ultimate consumers of energy
and did not have material negative impacts on the results of our operations. Our Energy Services
segment is not affected by energy prices, as we only allocate but do not charge for the energy.

**Segment Reporting**

We report in two segments, Energy Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions. Our reportable segment
Energy Services includes two operating segments – Energy Services Germany and Energy Services
International– which are aggregated into a single reportable segment as a result of similar economic
characteristics, products and services and similar distribution and customer structures.

Within the segment Energy Services, we provide our customers, which mainly comprise service
providers, including landlords and property managers, in the housing and real-estate industry, with
measurement, submeter reading and billing services relating to energy and water consumption as well
as selected adjacent services including services with regard to smoke detection. The reading and billing
services are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which impact the results of operations accordingly,
especially as the reading has historically taken place in the first months of a calendar year.

We rent and sell metering devices, which are necessary to provide the services. Rental contracts for the
metering devices have a term of up to ten years. We also offer maintenance services required for the
devices. Maintenance services are included in the rental contracts. For sold devices the maintenance
service is offered in separate maintenance contracts. Our supplementary services include the planning,
installation and maintenance of smoke detectors. The smoke detectors are usually rented to customers.
In addition, we offer a smoke detection service. In addition, we, in cooperation with SGS Institut
Fresenius, offer legionella analysis services, primarily in Germany.

The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions provides its customers with services in relation to the
planning, financing, construction and operation of heat generation plants and is focused on providing
green solutions. The plants are maintained and serviced continuously. Green solutions, gas, oil, district
heating and electricity are provided to the customers.

_Revenue_

Our revenues increased by 0.4% to €211.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from
€210.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The external revenue in our segments
developed as follows:

Energy Services: External revenue of Energy Services increased by 6.9% to €170.0 million in the three
months ended December 31, 2023 from €159.0 million in the three-month period ended December 31,
2022.

- Energy Services Germany: External revenue of Energy Services Germany increased by 5.5%
to €115.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €109.2 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2022. The key drivers behind this increase reflect continued
growth in our core business (billing and rental revenues), in addition to higher equipment sales
(e.g., in relation to our recently introduced product EV charging). This is partly offset by lower
revenues related to legionella analysis services which decreased by 25.4% to €1.9 million in
the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €2.5 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2022. This development is in line with the regular three-year testing cycle.
Excluding the revenue from legionella analysis, revenue of Energy Services Germany increased
by 6.2% to €113.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €106.7 million
in the three months ended December 31, 2022.

- Energy Services International: External revenue of Energy Services International increased by
9.9% to €54.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €49.8 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2022. This increase primarily reflects strong organic growth


-----

throughout the majority of countries included within this segment, mainly driven by the
effectiveness of pricing measures and higher volumes.

- Energy Efficiency Solutions: Our external revenue in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment
decreased by 19.7% to €41.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €51.5
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. This expected development with
minimal earnings impact primarily reflects the decrease in energy prices (pass-through item),
which more than offset the positive effect from new business growth.

_Capitalized internal work_

Capitalized internal work increased by 20.0% to €8.6 million in the three months ended December 31,
2023 from €7.1 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. This increase mainly reflects
higher capitalized installation costs within the Energy Services segment, as well as higher capitalized
personnel costs in relation to selected ENERGIZE-T measures.

_Other income_

Other income decreased by 49.9% to €2.0 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2023
compared to €4.0 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022 This decrease mainly reflects
lower remaining rental payments in relation to cancelled rental contracts.

_Product expenses and purchased services_

Product expenses and purchased services decreased by 19.7% to €56.7 million in the three months
ended December, 31, 2023 from €70.6 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. This
decrease is primarily explained by lower energy prices in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment,
partly offset by higher equipment sales in the Energy Services segment.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by 6.8% to €71.4 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2023
from €66.8 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. This increase mainly reflects an
intentional investment in additional personnel in order to further support the company’s growth path
and annual regular salary increases.

_Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,_
_intangible assets and right-of-use assets_

Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and right-of-use assets increased by 7.4% to €52.9 million in the three months ended
December, 31, 2023 compared to €49.2 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. This
increase mainly reflects a year-over-year increase in our rental base.

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by 10.1% to €28.2 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2023
from €25.6 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. The largest drivers behind this
increase are higher IT costs, as well as marketing and public relations costs.

_Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)_

EBIT increase by 34.6% to €12.7 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2023 compared to
€9.4 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. Apart from the increase in depreciation
and impairment losses explained above, the key drivers behind the development in EBIT are the same
as for the development of EBITDA. As such, please refer to the EBITDA explanations below.


-----

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by 11.8% to €65.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €58.7
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 10.7% to
€72.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €65.7 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2022. The key driver behind this increase is the top-line driven earnings growth,
in particular in relation to higher billing and rental revenues in the Energy Services segment, which
more than offset the increase in personnel and other expenses.

_Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method_

Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method remained stable at €0.1 million in
the three months ended December, 31, 2023 compared to €0.1 million in the three months ended
December, 31, 2022.

_Financial income and finance costs_

Financial income increased to €1.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €0.9
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. In the three months ended December 31, 2023
financial income mainly included exchange gains on intercompany loans of €0.4 million (three months
ended December 31, 2022: €0.6 million) and a gain resulting from foreign exchange hedges amounting
to €0.4 million (loss in the three months ended December 31, 2022: €0.1 million).

Finance costs increased to €63.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €50.1
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. These costs mainly include interest expenses,
which amounted to €62.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to €49.6
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Third party interest expenses increased to €36.1
million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €24.6 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2022, primarily due to the higher base rate interest levels on the capital markets. Interest
expenses on intercompany transactions increased to €26.5 million in the three months ended December
31, 2023 compared to €25.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in
interest expenses on intercompany transactions was due to the capitalization of unpaid interest
amounting to €99.0 million as of March 31, 2023.

_Income taxes_

Income tax expenses decreased to €0.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from €1.8
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. This results from deferred tax income which
decreased by €2.3 million, mainly resulting from the Energy Services Germany segment. Additionally,
current income tax expenses decreased by €1.1 million, mainly due to the decreased taxable income of
the German tax group, which leads to €1.5 million less current income taxes in this period. In contrast,
the taxable income of the ESI segment increased, which leads to €0.4 million more current income taxes
in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022.

_Net profit/loss_

In the three months ended December, 31, 2023 we generated a net loss of €48.6 million compared to a
net loss of €37.8 million in the three months ended December, 31, 2022. This decrease in net result was
mainly due to the increase in finance costs.

_Revenue_

Our revenues increased by 12.5% to €1,011.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023
from €899.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The external revenue in our
segments developed as follows:

Energy Services: External revenue of Energy Services increased by 12.5% to €852.9 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €758.5 million in the financial year ended September
30, 2022.

- Energy Services Germany: External revenue of Energy Services Germany increased by 12.1%
to €611.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €545.8 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The key drivers behind this increase include strong
growth in our core business (billing and rental revenues), in addition to higher revenues from
recently introduced products (e.g., provision of intra-annual consumption data and EV
charging). Also, revenue related to legionella analysis services increased by 30.0% to €10.1
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €7.8 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2022. This development is in line with the regular three-year testing cycle.
Excluding the revenue from legionella analysis, revenue of Energy Services Germany increased
by 11.8% to €601.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €538.0 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2022.

- Energy Services International: External revenue of Energy Services International increased by
13.4% to €241.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €212.8 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. This increase primarily reflects strong organic


-----

growth throughout the majority of countries included within this segment, mainly driven by the
effectiveness of pricing measures and higher volumes.

- Energy Efficiency Solutions: Our external revenue in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment
increased by 12.5% to €158.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from
€141.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The key drivers behind this
development include higher energy prices in combination with a solid operational contribution.

_Capitalized internal work_

Capitalized internal work increased by 14.0% to €35.1 million in the financial year ended September
30, 2023 from €30.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. This increase mainly
reflects higher capitalized installation costs within the Energy Services International segment.

_Other income_

Other income remained broadly stable at €11.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023
compared to €11.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022, representing an increase of
1.9%.

_Product expenses and purchased services_

Product expenses and purchased services increased by 20.2% to €240.9 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2023 from €200.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. This
increase is primarily driven by higher energy prices in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment and
higher equipment sales in the Energy Services segment, as well as higher external workforce expenses.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by 22.2% to €304.6 million in the financial year ended September 30,
2023 from €249.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. Apart from the intentional
investment in additional personnel in order to further support the company’s growth path and annual
regular salary increases, this increase is affected by sizeable one-off severance costs attributable to
ENERGIZE-T related personnel cost measures.

_Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,_
_intangible assets and right-of-use assets_

Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and right-of-use assets increased by 5.4% to €207.4 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2023 compared to €196.9 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. This
increase mainly reflects a year-over-year increase in our rental base.

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by 11.5% to €108.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023
from €96.9 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The largest drivers behind this
increase are higher IT costs, as well as travel and vehicle costs.

_Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)_

EBIT remained stable at €197.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to
€198.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022, representing a decrease of 0.4%. Apart
from the increase in depreciation and impairment losses explained above, the key drivers behind the
development in EBIT are the same as for the development of EBITDA. As such, please refer to the
EBITDA explanations below.


-----

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by 2.5% to €404.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from
€395.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022, and Adjusted EBITDA increased by
7.8% to €492.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €456.7 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The key driver behind this increase is the top-line driven
earnings growth, in particular in relation to higher billing and rental revenues in the Energy Services
Germany and Energy Services International segments, which more than offset the increase in personnel
and other expenses.

_Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method_

Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method increased to €0.8 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to €0.5 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2022. The increase was due to the increase in profit of the associated company,
Energieversorgungsgesellschaft Klinikum Ludwigsburg mbH.

_Financial income and finance costs_

Financial income decreased to €4.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €14.5
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. Financial income in the financial year ended
September 30, 2023 mainly included exchange gains on intercompany loans of €2.2 million (financial
year ended September 30, 2022: €2.2 million). Financial income in the financial year ended September
30, 2022 also included a gain on financial instruments resulting from the mark-to-market valuation of
the interest rate hedging instruments amounting to €11.3 million (financial year ended September 30,
2023: €0.6 million).

Finance costs increased to €228.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €202.0
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. These costs mainly include interest expenses,
which amounted to €225.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to €199.5
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. Third party interest expenses increased to
€123.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from €103.3 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the higher base rate interest levels on the capital markets.
Interest expenses on intercompany transactions increased to €102.0 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2023 compared to €96.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The
increase in interest expenses on intercompany transactions was due to the capitalization of unpaid
interest amounting to €93.3 million as of March 31, 2022 and €99.0 million as of March 31, 2023.

_Income taxes_

Income tax expenses increased to €30.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from
€26.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. Deferred tax expenses decreased by €0.7
million mainly resulting from the Energy Services Germany segment. Additionally, current income tax
expenses increased by €4.8 million mainly due to the increased taxable income of the German tax group
and of the Energy Services International segment in total in the financial year ended September 30,
2023 compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2022.

_Net profit/loss_

In the financial year ended September 30, 2023 we generated a net loss of €55.7 million compared to a
net loss of €15.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease in net result was
mainly due to the increase in finance costs and tax expenses and the decrease in financial income.

_Revenue_

Our revenues increased by 9.9% to €899.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from
€818.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The external revenue in our segments
developed as follows:

- Energy Services: External revenue of Energy Services increased by 5.2% to €758.5 million in
the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €720.7 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021 and, as a percentage of our total revenue, decreased to 84.3% in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022 from 88.0% in the financial year ended September
30, 2021.

- Energy Services Germany: External revenue of Energy Services Germany increased by 3.4%
to €545.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €527.7 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2021 and, as a percentage of our total revenues, decreased
to 60.7% in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from 64.5% in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021. The key drivers behind this increase include higher billing and rental
revenues (both the result of an increase in new business and a lower churn rate), in addition to
new revenues from our new EED product (provision of intra-annual consumption data), partly
offset by lower equipment sales (one-off smoke detector sales included in prior year figure).
Revenue related to legionella analysis services increased by 5.1% to €7.8 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €7.4 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021, and, as a percentage of our total revenues, remained stable at 0.9%.
Excluding the revenue from legionella analysis, revenue of Energy Services Germany increased
by 3.4% to €538.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €520.3 million


-----

in the financial year ended September 30, 2021 and, as a percentage of our total revenues,
decreased to 59.8% in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from 63.6% in the financial
year ended September 30, 2021.

- Energy Services International: External revenue of Energy Services International increased by
10.2% to €212.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €193.1 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2021, and, as a percentage of our total revenue,
increased to 23.7% in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from 23.6% in the financial
year ended September 30, 2021. This increase primarily reflects organic growth throughout the
majority of the countries included within this segment.

- Energy Efficiency Solutions: Our external revenue in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment
increased by 44.1% to €141.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared
to €97.9 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021 and, as a percentage of our
total revenue, increased to 15.7% in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from 12.0%
in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The key driver behind this development is the
pass-through of higher energy costs.

_Capitalized internal work_

Capitalized internal work increased by 17.4% to €30.8 million in the financial year ended September
30, 2022 from €26.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This increase mainly
reflects higher capitalized personnel costs in relation to selected _ENERGIZE-T measures as well as_
higher capitalized installation costs within the Energy Services International segment.

_Other income_

Other income increased by 13.3% to €11.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from
€9.9 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This increase mainly reflects a gain
realized in the context of an acquisition.

_Product expenses and purchased services_

Product expenses and purchased services increased by 12.2% to €200.5 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2022 from €178.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This
increase is primarily driven by the aforementioned external revenue increase in the Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment.

_Personnel expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by 6.0% to €249.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022
from €235.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This increase mainly reflects an
intentional investment in additional personnel in order to further support the company’s growth path in
the future as well as annual regular salary increases.

_Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,_
_intangible assets and right-of-use assets_

Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment,
intangible assets and right-of-use assets decreased by 18.1% to €196.9 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2022 compared to €240.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021.
This is mainly the result of a lower amortization of customer relationships, reflecting recent
improvements in the customer churn rate.


-----

_Other expenses_

Other expenses increased by 11.8% to €96.9 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022
from €86.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The main drivers behind this
increase are higher office costs (financial year ended September 30, 2021 includes provision release in
relation to our headquarter offices), vehicle and travel costs, and personnel recruitment/training costs,
partly offset by lower consulting costs.

_Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT)_

EBIT increased by 73.9% to €198.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €114.0
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Apart from the decrease in depreciation and
impairment losses explained above, the key drivers behind the development in EBIT are the same as
for the development of EBITDA. As such, please refer to the EBITDA explanations below.

_EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA_

EBITDA increased by 11.5% to €395.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from
€354.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The key driver behind this development
is the top-line driven earnings growth across all segments, which more than offset the increase in
personnel and other expenses.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by 3.9% to €456.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022
from €439.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The key driver behind this
development is the top-line driven earnings growth across all segments, which more than offset the
increase in personnel and other expenses.

_Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method_

Share of profit of investments accounted for using the equity method decreased to €0.5 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to €0.6 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021. The decrease was due to the decreased share of profit from the associated
company, Energieversorgungsgesellschaft Klinikum Ludwigsburg mbH.

_Financial income and finance costs_

Financial income increased to €14.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €13.3
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Financial income in the financial year ended
September 30, 2022 mainly included a gain on financial instruments resulting from the mark-to-market
valuation of the interest rate hedging instruments amounting to €11.3 million (financial year ended
September 30, 2021: €11.4 million) and exchange gains on intercompany loans of €2.2 million
(financial year ended September 30, 2021: €1.3 million).

Finance costs increased to €202.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €200.8
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. These costs mainly include interest expenses,
which amounted to €199.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to €199.6
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Third party interest expenses decreased to
€103.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from €109.0 million in the financial year
ended September 30, 2021, mainly due to the repayment of the Senior Notes in an aggregate nominal
amount of €50.0 million in September 2021. Interest expenses on intercompany transactions increased
to €96.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to €90.6 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in interest expenses on intercompany
transactions was due to the capitalization of unpaid interest amounting to €88.0 million as of March 31,
2021 and €93.3 million as of March 31, 2022.


-----

_Income taxes_

Income tax expenses increased to €26.2 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 from
€10.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Current income tax expenses increased
by €10.7 million mainly due to the increased taxable income of the German tax group in the financial
year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Additionally,
deferred tax income decreased by €5.0 million, mainly resulting from the Energy Services Germany
segment.

_Net loss_

In the financial year ended September 30, 2022 we generated a net loss of €15.0 million compared to a
net loss of €83.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease in net loss was
mainly due to the increase in EBIT, which was partly offset by the increase in income tax expenses. Net
financial result remained stable in absolute terms.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Our principal sources of liquidity are existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations
and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that €42.8 million of drawings will be
outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date and that approximately €5.1 million
in non-cash guarantees under the Revolving Credit Facility will remain outstanding. See
“Capitalization.” Following completion of the Senior Facilities Extension and Upsize, our total
Revolving Credit Facility will be increased to €398.4 million. Drawings under the Revolving Credit
Facility will be subject to certain conditions. We enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order
to hedge against interest rate risk associated with our borrowings that are subject to floating rates of
interest, including the Senior Facilities. As the Senior Secured Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we
do not anticipate entering into any interest rate hedges in connection therewith. See “Description of
_Other Indebtedness.”_

We anticipate that our principal uses of cash will be to fund capital expenditures, provide working
capital, meet debt service requirements (including under the Senior Facilities, the Senior Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes) and finance our strategic plans.

We may also seek to finance our capital expenditures and other cash requirements through finance
leases or other debt arrangements that provide liquidity on favorable borrowing terms.

Based on our current operating performance and liquidity, after giving effect to the Transactions, we
believe that the cash provided by our operating activities, available cash balances and commitments
under the Revolving Credit Facility available for future drawing will be sufficient to fund our projected
working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.

Our management continues to monitor working capital activities on a regular basis and as a result does
not expect significant movements in the core working capital categories in the near term.

We believe cash generated from our operations and other current sources of financing will be adequate
to meet our foreseeable financial needs. We may from time to time seek to retire or repurchase our
outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions
or otherwise. Such repurchases will depend on market conditions, our liquidity requirements,
contractual restrictions and other factors, and the amounts involved may be material.

**_Working Capital_**

Working Capital consists of trade accounts receivables, contract assets and inventories less trade
accounts payable.

In our Energy Services segment, receivables generally represent revenue from equipment rental,
maintenance and reading and billing agreements. In general, rental, maintenance and reading and billing
services are invoiced once a year, leading to the recognition of billed receivables. Revenue from rental
and maintenance agreements is accrued or deferred (depending on whether they are invoiced in arrears
or in advance, respectively) and recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the term of the
agreement and evenly distributed throughout the year. This leads to the recognition of unbilled trade
accounts receivable or contract liabilities, respectively. Revenue from reading and billing services is
accrued and recognized over time with respect to the services already rendered and generally follow a
seasonal pattern, with the majority of reading and billing services being realized in the first months of
the calendar year. This leads to the recognition of contract assets.

In the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment, revenue in respect of the delivery of heat is recognized
over time in relation to the amount of the services already rendered, leading to a higher volume of trade
accounts receivable (prepayments and monthly accruals) in the winter months, which has been
particularly high since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict caused gas prices to rise.

The following table summarizes our historical working capital as of the dates indicated:

_December 31, 2023 Compared with September 30, 2023_

Working capital amounted to €262.8 million as of December 31, 2023 compared to €259.4 million as
of September 30, 2023. The predominant driver behind the overall increase of €3.4 million is the
increase in trade accounts receivable, which amounted to €4.9 million and reflects an increase in
unbilled trade accounts receivable, which was partly offset by a decrease in billed receivables. Whilst
the former is mainly explained by the regular accrual of annual rental and maintenance revenues, the
latter is primarily driven by the receipt of customer payments in relation to previously invoiced


-----

revenues. The developments in contract assets, inventories and trade accounts payable are considerably
smaller in absolute terms and largely offset one another.

_September 30, 2023 Compared with September 30, 2022_

Working capital amounted to €259.4 million as of September 30, 2023 compared to €250.0 million as
of September 30, 2022. The largest driver behind the overall increase of €9.4 million in financial year
ended September 30, 2023 is the increase in inventories, which amounted to €23.9 million from €56.2
million as of September 30, 2022 to €80.0 million as of September 30, 2023. This increase is due to the
build-up of a safety buffer in order to ensure product availability in light of ongoing supply chain
shortages, as well as to support increased installation activities. Furthermore, trade accounts receivable
increased by €8.3 million from €215.9 million as of September 30, 2022 to €224.2 million as of
September 30, 2023. This increase is the result of (i) higher billed receivables in the Energy Services
International and Energy Efficiency Solutions segments attributable to top-line growth and comparably
later customer invoicing, respectively, partly offset by (ii) lower unbilled receivables, primarily driven
by the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment and affected by the increase in monthly customer
instalment payments in the second half of 2022, following the surge in energy prices. Furthermore,
contract assets increased by €1.9 million from €25.9 million as of September 30, 2022 to €27.8 million
as of September 30, 2023, mainly reflecting a higher amount of unfinished billing services in the Energy
Services Germany segment. In contrast, trade accounts payable increased by €24.6 million from €48.0
million as of September 30, 2022 to €72.6 million as of September 30, 2023, driven by higher device
purchases in the Energy Services Germany segment, in combination with comparably later supplier
invoicing in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment.

_September 30, 2022 Compared with September 30, 2021_

Working capital amounted to €250.0 million as of September 30, 2022 compared to €209.6 million as
of September 30, 2021. The largest driver behind the overall increase of €40.3 million is the increase in
trade accounts receivable, which increased by €31.4 million from €184.5 million as of September 30,
2021 to €215.9 million as of September 30, 2022. This increase is attributable to higher trade accounts
receivable in all segments affected by top-line growth, but most notably within the Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment driven by higher energy costs. Furthermore, inventories increased by €8.3 million
from €47.9 million as of September 30, 2021 to €56.2 million as of September 30, 2022, mainly to
support increased installation activities in the Energy Services International segment. Contract assets
and trade accounts payable remained broadly stable.

**_Capital Expenditures_**

Our capital expenditures mainly consist of purchases of metering and other devices (capitalized as a
result of new installations and the replacement of meters) as well as property, plant and equipment
(including technical equipment and machinery related to Energy Efficiency Solutions segment products
and other equipment) and intangible assets (including software developments). Capital expenditures in
connection with metering devices are only incurred when we have already concluded a rental contract
for those devices such that we can expect to generate revenue therefrom.

_Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended December 31, 2022_

In the three months ended December 31, 2023, our capital expenditures were €34.2 million compared
to €32.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of 6.0%. This increase is
primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditure for metering and other devices which amounted
to €2.8 million and is mostly explained by an increase in the installation of sub-metering devices in the
Energy Services segment, in light of the slightly improving device scarcity situation. In contrast, capital
expenditure for property, plant and equipment decreased by €0.6 million, primarily explained by lower
purchases of new office furniture at our headquarters. Capital expenditure for intangible assets remained
broadly stable.

_Financial Year Ended September 31, 2023 Compared with Financial Year Ended September 30, 2022_

In the financial year ended September 30, 2023, our capital expenditures were €162.4 million compared
to €151.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022, an increase of 7.5%. This increase is
mainly driven by an increase in capital expenditure for metering and other devices which amounted to
€6.3 million and is mainly explained by an increase in the installation of submetering devices in the
Energy Services International segment. Furthermore, capital expenditure for intangible assets increased
by €5.4 million primarily attributable to the acquisition of usage rights in relation to a larger project
within the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment. Capital expenditure for property, plant and equipment
remained stable.

_Financial Year Ended September 31, 2022 Compared with Financial Year Ended September 30, 2021_

In the financial year ended September 30, 2022, our capital expenditures were €151.1 million compared
to €148.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021, an increase of 1.7%. This increase is
primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditure for intangible assets which amounted to €8.2
million and largely reflects higher capitalized costs in relation to selected _ENERGIZE-T measures._
Furthermore, capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment increased by €1.8 million,
explained by comparably higher project completions in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment. These
developments are largely offset by a decrease in capital expenditure for metering and other devices,
which amounted to €7.5 million and is mainly affected by fewer smoke detector installations (roll-out
tailing-off), as well as the harmonization of calibration periods of water meters and heat meters and the
current supply situation.

_Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended December 31, 2022_

Cash generated by operating activities. Our cash generated by operating activities was €23.1 million in
the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared with €42.0 million in the three months ended
December 31, 2022. The primary movements in cash generated by operating activities in the three
months ended December 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2022 were the
following:

- EBITDA increased by €6.9 million to €65.6 million in the three months ended December 31,
2023 from €58.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022.

- Changes in working capital generated a negative cash flow effect of €2.4 million in the three
months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a positive cash flow effect of €6.2 million in
the three months ended December 31, 2022. The key drivers behind the resulting negative cash
flow variance of €8.6 million are: (i) a €16.1 million negative cash flow variance from changes
in trade accounts payable within Energy Services Germany and the Energy Efficiency Solutions
segment, primarily affected by the timing of supplier payments and lower energy prices,
respectively, partly offset by (ii) a €8.3 million positive cash flow variance from changes in
trade accounts receivable (including unbilled receivables), largely reflecting a seasonally driven
build-up of unbilled receivables in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment in the prior year
period (following the increase in monthly customer instalment payments in the second half of
2022, the comparable effect for the current financial year is included within changes in other
liabilities).

- Changes in other receivables remained stable in absolute terms and generated a negative cash
flow effect of €3.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a
negative cash flow effect of €4.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022,
resulting in a positive cash flow variance of €0.7 million.

- Changes in other liabilities generated a negative cash flow effect of €30.1 million in the three
months ended December 31, 2023, compared to a negative cash flow effect of €16.6 million in
the three months ended December 31, 2022. The resulting negative cash flow variance of €13.5
million is mainly affected by a seasonally driven decrease of other liabilities in the Energy
Efficiency Solutions segment (comparable effect for prior year period included within changes
in working capital), as well as the prior year period including the receipt of relief payments
from the KfW Bank (energy price cap).


-----

- Changes in provisions generated a negative cash flow effect of €6.3 million in the three months
ended December 31, 2023, compared to a negative cash flow effect of €2.1 million in the three
months ended December 31, 2022. The resulting negative cash flow variance of €4.3 million
mainly reflects severance payments in connection with ENERGIZE-T related personnel cost
measures.

Cash flows used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by €9.0 million
to a negative cash flow effect of €42.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 from a
negative cash flow effect of €33.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The key
drivers behind this increase are higher payments in connection with the acquisition of smaller cost
allocation companies, as well as higher capital expenditures.

Free cash flow. Based on our cash flows generated by operating activities and cash flows used in
investing activities as well as income taxes paid, our free cash flow decreased by €30.0 million to a
negative cash flow effect of €31.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to
a negative cash flow effect of €1.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The largest
drivers behind this development are (i) the prior year period including a favorable effect from the receipt
of relief payments from the KfW Bank (energy price cap), (ii) higher level of activity with regard to the
acquisition of smaller German cost allocation companies, (iii) a shift of supplier payments within
Energy Services Germany from the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to the
quarter ended December 31, 2023, and (iv) severance payments in connection with _ENERGIZE-T_
related personnel cost measures.

Net cash generated by financing activities. Net cash generated by financing activities amounted to an
inflow of €101.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to an inflow of €45.2
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net change in debt amounted to an inflow of
€104.1 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to an inflow of €49.5 million
in the three months ended December 31, 2022. The inflow in the three months ended December 31,
2023, was due to drawings of the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of €110.0 million,
which are partly offset by the repayment of lease liabilities in an amount of €5.5 million and other minor
movements. The inflow in the three months ended December 31, 2022 was due to the net drawings of
the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of €55.1 million, which are partly offset by the
repayment of lease liabilities in an amount of €5.0 million and other minor movements.

Interest paid decreased to €2.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to €3.7
million in the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Cash and cash equivalents as per the consolidated statement of cash flows amounted to €105.5 million
as of December 31, 2023 compared to €72.5 million as of December 31, 2022.

_Financial Year Ended September 31, 2023 Compared with Financial Year Ended September 30, 2022_

Cash generated by operating activities. Our cash generated by operating activities was €436.0 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to €349.5 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2022. The primary movements in cash generated by operating activities in the financial
year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2022 were the
following:

- EBITDA increased by €9.7 million to €404.8 million in the financial year ended September 30,
2023 from €395.1 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022.

- Changes in working capital generated a negative cash flow effect of €6.0 million in the financial
year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a negative cash flow effect of €37.4 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The key drivers behind the resulting positive cash
flow variance of €31.5 million are: (i) a €25.3 million positive cash flow variance from changes


-----

in trade accounts payable, mainly explained by higher device purchases in the Energy Services
Germany segment, in combination with comparably later supplier invoicing in the Energy
Efficiency Solutions segment; and (ii) a €23.1 million positive cash flow variance from changes
in trade accounts receivable (including unbilled receivables), predominantly affected by the
increase in monthly customer instalment payments in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment
in the second half of 2022, following the surge in energy prices; partly offset by (iii) a €13.7
million negative cash flow variance from changes in inventories, reflecting the build-up of a
safety buffer in order to ensure product availability in light of ongoing supply chain shortages,
as well as to support increased installation activities.

- Changes in other receivables generated a negative cash flow effect of €5.2 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a negative cash flow effect of €3.2
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The resulting negative cash flow
variance of €2.0 million mainly relates to changes in VAT tax claims.

- Changes in other liabilities generated a positive cash flow effect of €21.8 million in the financial
year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a negative cash flow effect of €3.5 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The resulting positive cash flow variance of €25.3
million is mainly attributable to the aforementioned increase in monthly customer instalment
payments in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment.

- Changes in provisions generated a positive cash flow effect of €22.9 million in the financial
year ended September 30, 2023 compared to a positive cash flow effect of €0.3 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The resulting positive cash flow variance of €22.6
million is mainly due to a build-up in severance provisions attributable to ENERGIZE-T related
personnel cost measures.

Cash flows used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by €4.1 million
to a negative cash flow effect of €222.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 from a
negative cash flow effect of €218.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The key
drivers behind this increase are higher payments in connection with the acquisition of smaller cost
allocation companies, as well as higher capital expenditures.

Free cash flow. Based on our cash flows generated by operating activities and cash flows used in
investing activities as well as income taxes paid, our free cash flow increased by €69.3 million to a
positive cash flow effect of €160.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to
a positive cash flow effect of €90.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. The largest
drivers behind this development are (i) the top-drive driven earnings growth, in combination with (ii)
the increase in monthly customer instalment payments in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment in
the second half of 2022, following the surge in energy prices, reflecting effective working capital
management.

Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to an outflow of
€152.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to an outflow of €104.7 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. Net change in debt amounted to an outflow of €50.8
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to an outflow of €14.4 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. The outflow in the financial year ended September 30, 2023
was due to a net repayment of the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of €29.9 million,
the repayment of lease liabilities in an amount of €19.8 million and other minor movements. The
outflow in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 was due to the repayment of lease liabilities in
an amount of €20.5 million and other minor movements in an aggregate amount of €3.8 million. As an
offsetting effect net cash drawings of the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €9.9 million were
made.


-----

Interest paid increased to €101.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2023 compared to
€90.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022.

Cash and cash equivalents as per the consolidated statement of cash flows amounted to €36.0 million
as of September 30, 2023, compared to €28.9 million as of September 30, 2022. Cash and cash
equivalents as per the consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2023 are €1.4
million lower than in the consolidated statement of cash flows because this amount is recognized as
assets classified as held for sale in the consolidated statement of financial position.

_Financial Year Ended September 31, 2022 Compared with Financial Year Ended September 30, 2021_

Cash generated by operating activities. Our cash generated by operating activities was €349.5 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to €337.8 million in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021. The primary movements in cash generated by operating activities in the financial
year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the financial year ended September 30, 2021 were the
following:

- EBITDA increased by €40.6 million to €395.1 million in the financial year ended September
30, 2022 from €354.5 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021.

- Changes in working capital generated a negative cash flow effect of €37.4 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to a negative cash flow effect of €9.1
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The largest drivers behind the resulting
negative cash flow variance of €28.3 million are: (i) a €17.7 million negative cash flow variance
from changes in trade accounts receivable (including unbilled receivables), affected by top-line
growth in all segments, but most notably in the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment driven by
higher energy costs; (ii) a €6.3 million negative cash flow variance from changes in trade
payables, primarily explained by the prior year figure including a one-off impact relating to a
refined calculation model applied to the accrual of revenues and costs in the Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment; and (iii) a €4.6 million negative cash flow variance from changes in
inventories, largely reflecting the build-up of stock levels in our Energy Services International
segment in order to support increased installation activities.

- Changes in other receivables generated a negative cash flow effect of €3.2 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to a positive cash flow effect of €0.5 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The negative cash flow variance of €3.8 million
is mainly attributable to changes in supplier balances in the Energy Efficiency Solutions
segment in the prior year period affected by higher energy costs (offsetting effect within
changes in other liabilities).

- Changes in other liabilities generated a negative cash flow effect of €3.5 million in the financial
year ended September 30, 2022 compared to a negative cash flow effect of €7.8 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2021. The resulting positive cash flow variance of €4.3
million is mainly attributable to changes in customer balances in the Energy Efficiency
Solutions segment in the prior year period affected by higher energy costs (offsetting effect
within changes in other receivables).

- Changes in provisions remained stable in absolute terms and generated a positive cash flow
effect of €0.3 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to a positive
cash flow effect of €0.4 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021 resulting in a
negative cash flow variance of €0.1 million.

Cash flows used in investing activities. Cash flows used in investing activities increased by €46.7
million to a negative cash flow effect of €218.6 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022
from a negative cash flow effect of €172.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. This
increase is primarily driven by (i) higher payments in connection with the acquisition of smaller cost


-----

allocation companies; (ii) a loan granted to the parent company Luxembourg Investment Company 261
S.à r.l. used to pay holding company expenses, as well as the service fee to our shareholders; and (iii)
an increase in capital expenditures.

Free cash flow. Based on our cash flows generated by operating activities and cash flows used in
investing activities as well as income taxes paid, our free cash flow increased by €37.9 million to a
positive cash flow effect of €90.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to
a positive cash flow effect of €52.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. The key
drivers behind this development are (i) considerably lower tax payments, as the prior year included a
sizable one-off effect (combination of final payments, advance payments, and retroactive advance
payments); as well as (ii) a positive deviation in cash generated by operating activities, reflecting topline driven earnings growth, which more than offset the build-up in working capital; partly met by (iii)
a negative deviation in cash flows used in investing activities.

Net cash used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities amounted to an outflow of
€104.7 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to an outflow of €165.2 million
in the financial year ended September 30, 2021. Net change in debt amounted to an outflow of €14.4
million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to an outflow of €69.7 million in the
financial year ended September 30, 2021. The outflow in the financial year ended September 30, 2022
was due to the repayment of lease liabilities in an amount of €20.5 million and other minor movements
in an aggregate amount of €3.8 million. As an offsetting effect net cash drawings of the Revolving
Credit Facility in an amount of €9.9 million were made. The outflow in the financial year ended
September 30, 2021 was due to the voluntary partial repayment of the Senior Notes in an amount of
€50.0 million in September 2021, the repayment of lease liabilities in an amount of €19.5 million and
other minor cash movements.

Interest paid decreased to €90.8 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2022 compared to
€96.0 million in the financial year ended September 30, 2021.

Cash and cash equivalents as per the consolidated statement of cash flows amounted to €28.9 million
as of September 30, 2022 compared to €41.3 million as of September 30, 2021.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, financial guarantees in an amount of €0.2 million have been
issued.


-----

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a
current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk**

Our segments operate in competitive markets and are subject to changes in business, economic and
competitive conditions. Our business is subject to:

- credit risks;

- liquidity risks;

- interest rate risks and interest rate management;

- risks relating to interest rate instruments not subject to hedge accounting; and

- currency risks and risks relating to currency management.

Developments in any of these risk areas could cause our results to differ materially.

**_Credit Risks_**

We offer our services to a large number of customers active in various sectors and geographical regions.
We grant credit terms to eligible customers and believe we are not exposed to an unreasonable
concentration of risk. Imminent or actual irrecoverable receivables are accounted for by write-downs
depending on the age of the receivable concerned. Several dunning stages are also used. When a certain
dunning stage is reached, legal action is initiated. Furthermore, allowances for expected credit losses
are recorded with respect to trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and
unbilled receivables.

As of December 31, 2023 the total of trade accounts receivable, including receivables from finance
leases (current and non-current), was €235.5 million. The historical write-offs of our trade accounts
receivable amounted to €0.2 million in the financial year ended December 31, 2023.

**_Liquidity Risks_**

Liquidity risk is the risk concerning the ability to meet obligations arising out of financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk arises mostly in relation to cash flows generated and used in working capital and from
financing activities, particularly by servicing our debt, in terms of both interest and capital, and our
payment obligations relating to our ordinary business activities. We manage liquidity risks by
continually monitoring our expected cash flows and working capital levels and ensuring that adequate
borrowing facilities are maintained.

**_Interest Rate Risks and Interest Rate Management_**

Interest rate risks arise from the fact that a large part of our loan agreements is subject to a floating rate
of interest. Our interest rate risk is analyzed centrally and managed by the treasury department. Interest
rate risk items are separated from the liquidity commitment in individual hedge agreements with the
help of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate caps, and are managed as an overall portfolio to
balance the risks. Interest rate derivatives are used exclusively to optimize credit terms and limit interest
rate risks as part of our financing strategy and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging
instruments are only used in the Group to hedge interest rate risks on variable cash flows (cash flow
hedges).


-----

In accordance with internal guidelines, the use of derivatives is restricted to the hedging of existing
risks. Generally, we use hedging instruments that are measurable and have a transparent risk profile.
All derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 (Fair value measurement). This
is determined using the mark-to-market method (for interest rate swaps and caps), including a credit
risk adjustment relating to the counterparty or us. The fair values of interest rate swaps and caps are
reported as other financial assets or other financial liabilities.

The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate. The Facility B and the Revolving Credit
Facility each bear interest at a variable rate, based on, EURIBOR (subject to a zero percent per annum
floor), or in the case of Revolving Credit Facility drawings denominated in pounds-sterling or US
Dollars, SONIA and term SOFR (respectively and each subject to a zero percent per annum floor), and
in each case plus an applicable margin.

**_Interest Rate Instruments Not Subject to Hedge Accounting_**

Changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement but do not affect cash. As of December
31, 2023, we had interest rate caps with a total nominal value of €880.0 million related to our current
Senior Facilities Agreement. These interest rate instruments capped the six-month EURIBOR for the
period from July 4, 2023 until January 4, 2024. In the Consolidated Financial Statements, the
receivables from hedging instruments are shown under current other financial assets because the
instruments can be cancelled at any time. The aggregate fair value of the cap agreements as of
September 30, 2023, was €1.8 million. As a result, 90% of our total non-current financial debt is either
fixed or capped for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023. Following the Transactions,
we plan to re-evaluate the implementation of hedging contracts for any floating rate debt exposure, in
line with our historical approach.

**_Currency Risks and Currency Management_**

A large part of our revenue was generated in the eurozone and was not subject to major currency risks.
However, currency risks may originate from loans that Techem Energy Services GmbH grants to its
subsidiaries outside the eurozone as part of intercompany financings.

As of December 31, 2023, we had foreign exchange hedging instruments not subject to hedge
accounting with an aggregate nominal amount of €19.0 million and an aggregate market value of €19.2
million.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

In the opinion of the management of our Group, the following accounting policies and topics are critical
for the Consolidated Financial Statements in the present economic environment. The influences and
judgements, as well as the uncertainties which affect them, are also important factors to be considered
when looking at present and future operating earnings of our Group.

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS requires assumptions and
estimates to be made which can impact the valuation of the assets and liabilities recognized, income
and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Assumptions and estimations also relate
to the accounting and measurement of provisions. All assumptions and estimations made are based on
the circumstances as of the balance sheet date. The actual future circumstances may differ. When this
occurs the assumptions will be adjusted, and, if applicable, the book values of the respective assets and
liabilities will also be adjusted.

We have summarized below our accounting policies that require the more subjective judgment of our
management in making assumptions or estimates regarding the effects of matters that are inherently
uncertain and for which changes in conditions may significantly affect our results of operations and
financial condition. For more information, see the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements
included in the financial statements included elsewhere in this financial report.


-----

_Business combinations. Subsidiaries acquired by the Group are accounted for using the acquisition_
method. The acquisition costs are equivalent to the fair value of the assets given up on the date of
acquisition. For each business combination the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified as
part of the business combination are measured at their fair values on the date of acquisition regardless
of the extent of the non-controlling interest. The excess of acquisition costs over the Group’s share in
the fair value of the net assets is recognized as goodwill. If the Group’s share in the fair value of the net
assets exceeds the acquisition cost, the remaining excess from a bargain purchase is recognized in the
statement of profit or loss. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in the statement
of profit or loss.

_Revenue recognition from major business activities. We believe that revenue recognition is critical for_
our financial statements because consolidated net income is directly affected by the timing of revenue
recognition. Revenue is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed under the contracts with our
customers. The Group uses the practical expedient of IFRS 15 (Revenue from contracts with
customers), therefore the transaction price is only adjusted for the effects of a significant financing
component if the expected period between when we transfer goods or services to the customer and when
the customer pays for those goods or services is more than one year. In the Group, this can be applicable
for installment sales. Some contracts in the Group include multiple performance obligations. In this
case, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone
selling prices. If they are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected cost plus a
margin approach.

For all major products, payment terms for goods or services may be in advance or in arrears. Revenue
for reading and billing services is accrued, using an output-based method of measuring the progress
towards complete satisfaction of this performance obligation, to an amount equivalent to the cost of
services already rendered plus a profit margin. The revenue for energy deliveries (for example, heat or
cooling) of the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions is recognized in an amount that corresponds
directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date. The revenue, as well as the
corresponding costs, are determined based on a calculation model. The calculation model determines
the sales not yet invoiced (essentially sales volume and commodity price) on the basis of current price
developments and weather conditions, as well as the costs on the basis of the consumption quantities
transmitted by the energy supplier.

Revenue recognition is less critical regarding rental and maintenance as well as sales revenue. Revenue
from rental and maintenance services is recognized using an output-based measure of progress towards
complete satisfaction of our performance obligations on a straight-line basis over the contractual term.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has been
transferred to the customer, which is upon delivery.

_Recoverability of non-current assets. Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets,_
including intangible assets, are tested for impairment as soon as events highlight, or there are indicators,
that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized equal to
the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the recoverable
amount being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use of the asset concerned.
The value in use is defined as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be derived from an
asset or a cash generating unit (CGU). In accordance with IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the price
that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. For the purposes of determining an impairment, assets are grouped together into the
smallest group for which separate cash flows can be identified.

Goodwill, trademark Techem as well as software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are
subject to an impairment test at least once a year and are not subject to straight-line amortization. The
impairment test is carried out for groups of CGUs. Goodwill, the trademark Techem as well as software
in development are measured at their original cost less any accumulated impairment. Impairment losses
recognized for goodwill are not reversed.


-----

_Trade accounts receivable, contract assets, other assets and other financial assets. Current and non-_
current receivables (trade accounts receivable, other assets and other financial assets) are measured at
fair value on the date of recognition and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest
method (including receivables from installment-based business). The Group applies the Simplified
Approach according to IFRS 9 for the calculation of expected credit losses. Therefore, billed trade
accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables are subject to
allowances for expected credit losses over their entire term. To determine the expected credit losses
trade accounts receivable are arranged into groups based on their maturity and are appropriately
impaired based on their age. Contractual assets are recognized in the amount of the right to consideration
for services already rendered.

_Provisions. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits are determined in accordance_
with IAS 19 using the actuarial projected unit credit method. This method takes into account, in
particular, the current long-term capital market interest rate and current assumptions regarding future
salary and annuity increases in addition to biometric calculation bases. In accordance with IAS 19, the
remeasurements of the provisions for pensions are recognized directly in other comprehensive income.
The interest element in the pension expense is reported under finance costs.

With the exception of the other personnel-related provisions calculated in accordance with IAS 19, all
other provisions are recognized on the basis of IAS 37, providing there is a present legal or constructive
obligation as a result of a past event, an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized is
determined based on the full amount required to settle the probable obligation. Non-current provisions
are discounted. The interest element is reported under finance costs.

_Deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liabilities method. Deferred tax assets or_
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the corresponding tax accounts, the result of which will be a
future tax refund or tax expense. Deferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recognized to the
extent that it is probable that there will be an available taxable profit against which the temporary
difference can be applied.

Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income
in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. If there is a change in the tax
rates, the effect on the deferred tax assets and/or liabilities is recognized in the statement of profit or
loss in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedging. In accordance with IFRS 9, all derivative financial_
instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. On the trade
date of a derivative, it is determined whether this derivative is an instrument to maintain fair value, to
hedge a planned transaction or to hedge against future cash flow fluctuations relating to a recognized
asset or a liability.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate instruments and the foreign exchange hedging instruments
of the Group are recognized as financial income and finance costs.

_Share-based payment. Under the terms of a management participation program, which was set up by_
one of our main investors, employees of the Group (including most senior management) were given the
opportunity to invest indirectly into the Group with their own cash. This participation program is
deemed to be a share-based payment arrangement. It is classified as equity-settled and accounted for in
accordance with IFRS 2.

Any expense arising from an equity-settled share-based payment scheme is recognized as personnel
expense in profit or loss with a corresponding credit in equity. The distribution of the expense is based


-----

on the grant date fair value. This fair value will not change later, i.e., it will not be updated for changes
in expectations underlying its determination.

The recognition of expense over time is determined by the vesting conditions of the participation
program, particularly service and exit conditions. Exit conditions are classified as non-market vesting
conditions.

**INDUSTRY**

**Overview**

We are a leading digitally driven energy services provider active in the European residential heat and
water submetering market with a stronghold in Germany. We operate in 18 countries and maintain a
competitive position as we hold top 1 or top 2 positions in most of these countries (source:
_Commissioned Report). In Germany, we have a longstanding presence since the 1950s and are the_
market leader in heat and water submetering services with 28.1 million installed heat and water metering
devices resulting in a market share of approximately 27% as of 2022 (excluding revenue for smoke
detectors, water testing and issuance of energy certificates) (source: Commissioned Report).

We believe that our business has a systemic relevance to the energy transition as we help our clients in
their efforts to achieve regulatory targets in relation to decarbonization. Particularly the European Green
Deal has set ambitious climate targets for the real estate sector, which has accelerated the need for
energy efficiency solutions. Large real estate companies and other housing providers have made
commitments to carbon neutrality, with publicly declared goals until 2030 and beyond. Vonovia, for
example, has committed to reduce carbon intensity to less than 25 kg CO2e per m[2] (in Germany) by
2030 and to operate a nearly climate-neutral housing stock by 2045, with a carbon intensity of less than
5kg of CO2 equivalents per m² of rental area (source: Vonovia). Recent external factors, such as the rise
in financing costs due to higher interest rates as well as the increase in energy prices have further
enhanced the need for low investment, high impact decarbonization solutions. As a result, we believe
that the real estate sector, i.e., tenants and landlords, has a strong interest in energy efficiency solutions
and strategic partnerships to achieve climate targets.

Submetering is a highly cost-efficient solution to drive energy efficiency and lower carbon emissions
in the real estate sector (source: Commissioned Report). The introduction of submetering can result in
approximately 20% of energy savings in a dwelling (source: Commissioned Report). Submetering
provides increased transparency, incentivizing tenants to save energy by closely monitoring their own
consumption and submetering solutions represent less than 1% of average tenant spend on rent and
utility (source: Commissioned Report). Further, submetering has the lowest cost requirements to
achieve energy efficiency in the real estate sector, with annual cost per m[2] to save 1 kg to CO2 of less
than €1 compared to other methods such as cellar ceiling insulation with €13, facade insulation with
€14, roof insulation with €16, and window exchanges with €118 (source: Commissioned Report).

The submetering industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as its ongoing digitalization has
significantly enhanced service levels and opened up new value propositions. Fully remote readings
(nearly real time digital reading of energy consumption via radio-enabled devices and cloud-based data
collectors), monthly consumption information (digital availability of consumption data) up to direct ondemand billing (fully digitalized on-demand billing service via online portal), a service currently only
provided by us, contribute to resolving former concerns and provide high convenience for our customers
(property managers or landlords).

At the same time, increasing regulation and accelerating digitalization as well as recent macroeconomic
challenges drive complexity for the real estate sector. Housing providers often lack required in-house
capabilities (expertise, talent, tools, and scale) and seek to partner with an integrated energy efficiency
solutions provider as a strategic partner. We believe that this represents an opportunity for integrated,
digitally enabled metering and submetering companies to expand across additional value pools in the
real estate sector such as smoke detection and climate monitoring, water testing, contracting, MPO,
DHC, and EV Charging.

**Key Trends and Market Drivers**

**_EU Regulation_**

In the EU, commercial and residential buildings account for approximately 40% of energy-related
greenhouse gases (source: European Commission). Consequently, legislators have become active on a
national and a supranational level. The EU Green Deal, approved in 2020, as well as the so-called “Fit
for 55” legislation of the European Union and other legislative initiatives set ambitious decarbonization
goals for industries including real estate asking for:

- Full climate neutrality by 2050 which means that all buildings are to be so-called “ZeroEmission Buildings “by that time. Zero-Emissions Buildings are defined by the EU Green Deal
as a building with a very high energy performance and with a very low amount of energy still
required to be fully covered by energy from renewable sources and without on-site carbon
emissions from fossil fuels;

- Reduction of 55% of greenhouse gas emissions until 2030, compared to levels seen in 1990;

- All new buildings as of 2030 to be Zero-Emission Buildings (and for all new buildings occupied
or owned by public authorities as of 2027); and

- Fossil fuels in heating and cooling will be phased out by 2040.

The European Union’s initiative to reduce energy consumption did not commence with the Green Deal.
As early as 2010, the EU embarked on formulating a legislative framework toward this goal,
encompassing directives such as the Energy Efficiency Directive. The latter underwent amendments
aimed at expediting decarbonization and diminishing the EU’s reliance on fossil fuels. According to the
updated directive, it is mandated that monthly information regarding tenants’ energy consumption
becomes obligatory by 2027, with the expectation of fostering behavioral change. To facilitate this shift,
all submetering devices must be made remote-readable by the same year (source: Bain Brief).

**_German Regulation_**

In addition to the initiatives on European level, several Member States have also taken national
measures. Germany is amongst the frontrunners in this field setting out sectorial greenhouse gas targets
for 2030 and accelerating the net zero emission target from 2050 to 2045. For real estate companies,
the Buildings Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz, “GEG”), enacted in 2020, is of special interest. The
GEG regulates the energy requirements for new and existing buildings and the use of renewable
energies in buildings with the aim to create uniform requirements. Its recent amendment in 2023 is
expected to bring three major changes (source: Bain Brief):

- The reduction of the permissible annual primary energy needs in new buildings from previously
75% to 55% of the reference building;

- It requires that at least 65% of newly built heating systems to be powered by renewables; and

- It includes the requirement of submetering for heat pumps, which have previously been exempt
from submetering.

In the upcoming years, the emphasis on securing a minimum of 65% from renewable energy sources,
particularly, will lead to a technological transition favoring district heating and heat pumps.
Simultaneously, there will be a pronounced movement towards holistic energy solutions designed for
entire building districts, commonly known as “Quartierslösungen.” The successful implementation of
such district-wide solutions necessitates meticulous planning, including professional design, as well as
streamlined operations and heating cost allocation strategies.


-----

At the same time, real estate companies are also confronted with a rising CO2 price. Germany has
established a fixed price system per ton of CO2 via the national emissions trading system in 2021 on
fossil fuels used for primarily transport and heating. The price is currently (2024) fixed at €45 per ton
of CO2 and is anticipated to rise up to €65 per ton until 2026. In 2023, the price was maintained at 2022
levels, foregoing a scheduled tax increase owing to the Ukraine war and the ongoing energy crisis.
Starting in 2026, prices will be determined through certificate trading on the EU Emissions Trading
System which particularly covers on EU-level the area of transport and buildings (so-called “EU-ETS
II”). Prices are expected to continue to rise in this case to € 55 to 65 per ton (source: Bain Brief).

In addition, a CO2 distribution regulation was introduced for real estate by law (Gesetz zur Aufteilung
_der Kohlendioxidkosten) to split the carbon dioxide costs between landlord and tenant according to their_
areas of responsibility and possibilities for influencing a building’s carbon dioxide emissions.
Otherwise, landlord could pass on the costs related to a national emission trading system to the tenants.
Thus, parts of the CO2 price must be paid by the property owners. Regulation foresees the introduction
of burden sharing across ten housing efficiency categories leading to a cost participation of the property
owners depending on the CO2 path and energy efficiency of the building. The less energy-efficient a
building is, the higher is the share the landlord has to contribute take alongside together with an
increased overall total of taxes to be paid. In practice, in residential real estate, the landlord determines
the carbon dioxide emissions of the property as part of the annual heat cost allocation bill (source:
_Commissioned Report)._

**_Other Push Factors_**

We observe increasing decarbonization efforts from various stakeholders in order to provide sound
environmental reporting. As such, large housing associations have already reacted and made clear
decarbonization pledges (e.g., Vonovia states to reduce carbon intensity to less than 25 kg CO2e/m² in
Germany by 2030 (source: Bain Brief).

Tenants are becoming more aware and conscious of the energy price burden included in their rent and
the overall rising cost of living. The heightened awareness is particularly influenced by the EU-wide
surge in energy prices and the temporary energy shortage resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war.

The commercial sector encounters comparable decarbonization pressures, although the dynamics and
success factors differ. Commercial buildings, characterized by intricate technical installations, are
usually overseen – often manually – by facility management service providers. The intricacy of these
systems makes it challenging for commercial building owners to deliver sufficient E-S-G reporting
aligned with European regulation. As submetering in not implemented in the same rigor as in residential
real estate, no comprehensive data set on commercial properties’ CO2 footprint exist, thus CO2 tax is
often equally shared between landlords and tenants for now. However, there is potential that the
regulator might request the commercial real estate sector to adopt a similar practice, with enforcement
slated for 2025, leading to additional metering requirements. Over the recent years, some companies in


-----

the commercial segment already started to invest into such digital metering infrastructure (source: Bain
_Brief)._

**_Demand for Low Investment, High Impact Decarbonization Levers_**

We believe that a holistic approach of a broad set of levers is required to address the decarbonization
challenge in the whole real estate sector. In general, property owners have a broad range of measures
with different invasive character and different levels of investments. Examples of levers include thermal
insulation, renewable energy installation like photovoltaic systems and geothermal energy, heating
system replacement or upgrade by installing heat pumps, smaller heating systems or creating an access
to district heating, data-based and monitored operational management of the existing technical
infrastructure by for example boiler monitoring or energy contracting, consumption regulation by smart
meters amongst others.

We see evidence that the combination of various low-investment levers will provide significant energy
savings. Submetering constitutes a small portion of the monthly utility costs for tenants (less than 1%
of average tenant rent spend), but can contribute to approximately 20% of energy reduction (source:
_Bain Brief). Energy contracting can lead to energy savings in a similar order of magnitude and, in_
addition, these solutions can reduce investments and maintenance costs for property owners because of
outsourcing. For example, an optimized heat generator as well as a corresponding system operation
management and the user assistance results in savings potentials of approximately 20% per property
(source: Bain Brief).

Other low investment measures can also result in double-digit energy savings, for example:

- typically, approximately 10% energy savings alone typically achievable through optimization
of the operation management of existing heating systems;

- approximately 14% energy savings to be made through substitution of the boiler: around 86%
of heating systems are oversized (historical practice, no adaption in the context of renovations);

- approximately 10% of energy can be conserved when consumers with unfavorable
consumption patterns transition to becoming average consumers; and

- for approximately 79% of all boilers, a potential reduction of up to 10% in annual gas
consumption can be achieved by turning them off during the summer months (source: Bain
_Brief)._

Naturally, energy savings are also possible by better insulation or the installation of photovoltaic
systems on rooftops. Nevertheless, in the near term, the primary emphasis should be on cost-effective
measures to guarantee economic decarbonization and foster social acceptance, particularly amid rising
rents and interest rates. Considering rent and the ancillary cost split in Germany for 2022 as well as the
annual cost needed to save 1kg of CO2 per m[2], a comparison of the potential savings with the investment
ratios for measures demonstrates that smart metering (including submetering) and energy contracting
can outperform alternative saving measures (source: Bain Brief).

**_Demand for integrated, digitally enabled service providers_**

Implementing new means of extended metering and decarbonize heat and energy supply does not fall
within the primary focus on property owners’ business operations. Presently, many property owners
lack expertise, ranging from limited to none, in the realm of digitizing and automating the energy supply
for their buildings. Furthermore, regulation is constantly pushing the need for digital and automated
systems to ensure state-of-the-art technology supporting decarbonization goals. This rise in complexity
has also reversed the former trend to insource some parts of submetering (source: Bain Brief). In fact,
according to a survey conducted by Bain comprising 1,087 participants, the majority of respondents
(55%) indicated no service at all are expected to be insourced in the next two years (source:
_Commissioned Report)._

Due to these considerations, the majority of building owners will likely have to depend on third-party
providers. These providers can offer a comprehensive array of services through a unified platform,
consolidating the top individual solutions presently accessible in the market. Ideally, these packaged
solutions will encompass the entire value chain, spanning from heat and energy generation to electric
vehicle charging infrastructure and optimized consumption. Ultimately, pivotal partners will involve
integrated energy services providers for heat, water, and electricity (e.g., for heat pumps), offering a
completed spectrum of energy solutions for both residential and commercial housing. To successfully
navigate such intricate undertaking, essential partners must contribute a specific set of assets and
capabilities:

- Expertise in technology is essential for identifying optimal solutions in a broadening technology
mix, encompassing elements such as heat pumps and green energy sources.

- Having scale in both the property base and digital infrastructure is also crucial, as it is vital to
ensure effective leverage on fixed costs. This includes the hardware and IT platforms necessary
for delivering decarbonization services to the industry.

- Digital capabilities can be sourced either in-house or through reputable partners. Essential skills
include the processing and analysis of extensive datasets, a capability increasingly bolstered by
generative AI, as well as prompt compliance with evolving regulations.


-----

- Robust domain expertise and a deep understanding of a frequently changing regulatory
landscape are additional essential capabilities (source: Bain Brief).

Providers possessing such capabilities at scale are ideally positioned to function as integrated partners,
aiding the real estate sector in their journey toward digitalization and decarbonization. This is primarily
because multiple factors must be addressed within a unified energy system, necessitating interoperable
systems to effectively decarbonize buildings and districts. Moreover, managing the intricacies of
various factors demands data sovereignty to address the numerous interdependencies along the
decarbonization journey. Thereby, merely integrated partners will have the capacity to consolidate data
stemming from different factors and to manage such a high degree of connectedness and the complex
systems beyond (source: Bain Brief).

**Our Addressable Markets and Competitive Landscape**

The real estate sector can also pull several other decarbonization levers beyond submetering to deliver
on the climate goals defined through the European Green Deal. Specifically, the three main levers
comprise (1) smart energy services (e.g., renewable energy production, energy system management,
MPO, and EV Charging), (2) sustainable building solutions (e.g., heating optimization via DHC, heat
generation via contracting, district heating with recovered heat, window exchange, thermal solutions,
and LED lighting) as well as (3) tenant safety and control solutions (e.g., safety and fire protection,
water testing, indoor climate, and ventilation systems). Because of high overall solution complexity, we
see strong demand from the real estate sector for strategic partners providing an integrated portfolio of
solutions with one-stop-shop characteristics.

We believe to be able to effectively compete vis-à-vis competitors to act as the partner of choice and
drive decarbonization. With our integrated energy efficiency service portfolio based on an the _One_
_Digital Platform, we offer a deep range of services to customers out of one hand already today_
(including smoke detection and climate monitoring, water testing, contracting, MPO, DHC, and EV
Charging) and benefit from a high proximity to our submetering core business (including customer
sharing, ability to manage complexity at scale, sharing of digital capabilities, and energy efficiency
expertise). Additionally, we can offer high-value digital services to customers and tenants via our One
_Digital Platform allowing for data collection, processing, and data monitoring (source: Commissioned_
_Report)._

The following descriptions of our main markets focus on the European residential heat and water
submetering markets as well as the markets for smoke detection and climate monitoring, water testing,
and contracting in which we operate. In addition, we are also active in other energy services markets
related to our core business (e.g., MPO, DHV, and EV Charging).

**_German Residential Submetering Market (Heat and Water)_**

In 2023, the German residential heat and water submetering market amounted to approximately €1.8
billion, of which approximately 53% are attributed to corporate and approximately 47% to private
customers (source: Commissioned Report). This market is expected to grow at a CAGR of
approximately 4% between 2023 and 2028.

The market can be further broken down to services, hardware rental and hardware sales. The main
growth drivers over time include:

- Megatrends such as the shift towards energy efficient technologies, decarbonization as well as
digitalization. A further key pillar for future growth is expected to come through regulation,
since regulatory-driven changes will positively influence market size going forward, for
instance through the introduction of compulsory monthly consumption information provision
(required to be fully implemented until 2027), as well as CO2 tax allocation.

- Service revenue per dwelling is expected to increase at approximately 3% per annum between
2023 and 2028 based on a mix of key trends (source: Commissioned Report). The ongoing
digitalization of existing services improves quality and thus customer experience allowing for
an increase in prices on the back of higher value-add services. New mandatory services include
monthly consumption information and other services such as CO2 tax allocation. Moreover, a
tech mix shift leading to a favorable trend from heat cost allocators to heat meters (providing
approximately three times higher rental revenue per dwelling), as well as increased radio device
penetration and cloudification will drive higher future hardware revenue per dwelling (source:
_Commissioned Report)._

- As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, approximately 50% of the total German dwellings
stock is considered as “addressable,” that is if the dwellings are within an addressable building
type and heating system. As of 2023, in Germany there are 21.9 million addressable dwellings,
out of a pool of 43.3 million total dwellings (source: Commissioned Report). The German
residential heat and water submetering market addressable penetrated dwellings stands at
approximately 20.9 million dwellings indicating a highly penetrated rate of approximately 95%
(source: Commissioned Report).

The German heat and water residential submetering market is fairly concentrated with top five
companies constituting approximately 86% of the total market. We believe we are the market leader in
heat and water submetering services in Germany with a market share of approximately 27% (excluding


-----

revenue for smoke detection, water testing, and issuance of energy certificates) with an installed base
of 28.1 million heat and water meter devices as of 2022 (source: Commissioned Report). Having the
largest installed base of heat and water meter devices, a leading share of radio devices and
cloudification, superior service offering, distinctive customer approach we are convinced to be able to
effectively compete with other providers (source: Commissioned Report). Further top players include
Ista with an estimated market share of 24%, Brunata with an estimated market share of 15%, Minol
with an estimated market share of 11% and Kalo with an estimated market share of 9% (source:
_Commissioned Report)._

**_International Residential Submetering Markets (Heat and Water)_**

In the European residential heat and water submetering market we are active in 17 countries and
maintain strong competitive positions (leader or among top 3 in most markets) (source: Commissioned
_Report). With regard to the ten key markets for us, the addressable markets within Europe differ by_
maturity and can be divided into three categories: developed markets, developing markets, and other
markets.

- Developed markets (Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands and Italy) have
established heat cost allocation services and market growth is mainly driven by real estate
growth and a technology mix towards heat meters and radio, as well as service upselling
possibilities through consumption information and other digital services to selectively enhance
value per dwelling.

- Developing markets (Poland, France and Spain) have semi-mature established cost allocation
services and are expected to show growth through further enforcement of submetering due to
national implementation of the EED.

- Other markets (Norway) are adopting submetering due to environmental considerations and
certifications (e.g., BREEAM) as well as increasing energy prices driving the need for
consumption-based cost allocation.

In 2023, the international residential heat and water submetering market amounted to approximately
€845 million, of which approximately 50% is attributed to developed markets, approximately 48% to
developing markets and approximately 2% to other markets (source: Commissioned Report). It is
expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2023 and 2028.

**_Smoke Detection and Climate Monitoring Market_**

The German smoke detection and climate monitoring market is defined by the number of installed
smoke detection devices, which currently is at approximately €63 million, valued at €302 million and
expected to growth with a CAGR of approximately 7% between 2023 and 2028 (source: Commissioned
_Report). Besides smoke detectors for basic services as in the past, new MSDs with enhanced_
functionality will serve landlords and tenants with respect to health and safety matters. For the latter,
we expect that we will be at the center of the next replacement wave between 2023 and 2028 as we are
in the second phase of the new product development.

**German smoke detection and climate monitoring market (m€)**


x # of installed devices (sale and rental, m units) x% CAGR


(source: Commissioned Report)


-----

A major driver for the German smoke detection market is represented by the upcoming mandatory
replacement cycle for detectors, since smoke detectors are mandatory in all existing multi-dwelling
units with approximately 50 million devices expected to be installed between 2023 and 2028. The
market will be further driven by the trend towards higher value-added (multi-functional) services, such
as devices able to correlate multiple data (i.e., temperature, humidity and heat), which may be sold a 34 times higher prices compared to standard devices. Regulation allows for such an increase of prices to
be passed onto tenants via modernization fee for functionally-enhanced devices.

We believe that we hold a strong position in the corporate market for smoke detectors driven by the
high proximity to the submetering business, additionally benefitting from scale advantages and data
integration through our _One Digital Platform. We further believe to have a strong track record as_
technology leader in smoke detection which is hard to replicate by our competitors, such as proprietary
products with leading functionality and full radio capabilities like next-generation MSDs.

**_Water Testing Market_**

The German water testing market, currently valued at approximately €380 million, comprises mainly
of testing and advisory services. Testing services are related to water sample collection and analysis,
legionella reporting and certification provision required by regulation. Advisory services include cause
analyses and action recommendations in case of positive legionella tests. Additionally, prevention
services, an emerging segment of the overall water testing market, comprises of digitally enabled
monitoring of water systems to prevent, for instance, legionella.

**German Legionella testing and advisory market (m€)**


Testing Advisory **x** Buildings tested p.a. (k units) **x** Advisory services (k projects) **x%** CAGR


(source: Commissioned Report)

One of the main trends driving growth in the German water testing market is the need to professionalize
services in a fragmented market due to tightening of regulation. Regulatory changes enhance health
authorities means to intervene in case results reach or exceed legal thresholds, as well as increased
mandatory testing frequency leading to recurring tests within multi-dwelling units at least every three
years.


-----

**_Contracting Market_**

The German contracting market is split between contracting services provided to residential and
commercial customers, whereby the customer signs contracts with typical durations of 10-20 years with
the general contractor (source: Commissioned Report). As of 2023, the market is estimated to serve
approximately 0.8 million penetrated dwellings at a penetration rate of approximately 13% for both
residential and commercial buildings, indicating significant white space in the market:

**Penetrated dwellings in German contracting market (m)**


Residential Commercial **x%** Penetration rate (% with contracted **x%** Penetration rate (% with contracted **x%** CAGR
heating - residential) heating - commercial)


(source: Commissioned Report)

Growth in the German contracting market is driven by the need for realizing the net zero CO2 emission
target of the real estate sector (by 2045 at the latest) as well as the new CO2 tax allocation framework,
which became effective in 2023. Furthermore, higher interest rates challenge landlords’ investment
decisions by increasing financing costs, thus making outsourcing of solutions more attractive as they
can reduce the required capital expenditure. In parallel, rising energy prices (Germany natural gas prices
are expected to be up by approximately 35% in 2025 compared to 2019 (source: Commissioned Report))
incentivize improvements in energy efficiency, thus increasing the need for external contracting
partners with energy expertise.

Large players and municipal real estate companies need to follow a clear decarbonization plan and
contemporarily, smaller players and private landlords see the chance to increase their net asset value by
shifting towards “green contracting.” The regulatory shift towards green contracting solutions is
expected to drive new technologies, accelerate replacement cycles and encourage the trend to district
solutions. A further positive impact on the market’s penetration rate will come from the regulatory shift
described above. Finally, housing providers lack the tools, scale and know-how to mitigate the
challenges posed by a rapidly changing environment, making contracting service providers relevant
partners going forward.

We are the second largest player in the contracting market after GETEC, with a market share of
approximately 10% share and the largest submetering player with presence in the German contracting
market (source: Commissioned Report). We believe to be able to effectively compete based on our
capabilities in green contracting and an integrated view on properties through our One Digital Platform,
further enhanced by DHC.


-----

**_Metering Point Operations_**

The German MPO market comprises smart metering technologies such as radio meters (for electric,
power, gas, and district heat) and smart meter gateways. Currently approximately 0.3 million buildings
are penetrated with a penetration rate of approximately 7%, expected to significantly increase to 27%
by 2028 (source: Commissioned Report). One of the key trends fostering the penetration increase is the
requirement of mandatory smart metering by 2032 in Germany with MPO allowing for an integrated
perspective on all commodity inflows thereby further serving as plug for energy efficiency solutions.
We also see a further trend towards increasing the digitalization of properties, for example via the
installation of heat pumps, solar PV and EV Charging, as well as the need of integrated CO2 footprint
of properties (e.g., sustainability reporting and CO2 tax allocation).

**_Digital Heat Chain_**

The DHC market in Germany contains boiler room monitoring and analysis (smart monitors, heat cost
allocator, heat meters, smart gas meters), digital infrastructure (cloud infrastructure, dashboard / user
interface), boiler room remote control (analogue interface modules, digital interfaces, heating
manufacturer cloud), a well as usage data capture. Currently approximately 2% of addressable e multidwelling units in Germany are penetrated amounting to approximately 14,000 buildings Currently, most
of the heat generation units are oversized and not efficiently run, nor balanced within the heating system.
Hence, the real estate sector requires ongoing energy efficiency improvements even before heating
systems can be replaced by green contracting. A DHC service helps lowering CO2 emissions and
optimizing heat system design, thus aiding towards the fulfillment of decarbonization goals.

**_EV Charging_**

The German electric vehicle market comprises charging points, such as connectors, charging cables,
power supply and control boards, as well as digital infrastructure, such as cloud infrastructure and
dashboard / user interface. Currently, merely approximately 0.1 million multi-dwelling units are
penetrated in Germany, at a penetration rate of approximately 2-4%. The ongoing electrification of
transportation with increasing demand for electric vehicles coupled with a strong customer perception
regarding charging times and fragmentation of the charging point network are expected to drive electric
vehicle charging solutions penetration going forward. The trend towards convenient charging both at
home (fueled by tenant demand as well as favorable regulation and financial incentives such as the
_Gebäudeelektromobilitätsinfrastrukturgesetz) and at work (triggered by employee demand and_
reflection of EV Charging points in sustainability agenda of employers) will further drive growth in the
electric vehicle charging solutions market in Germany.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are a leading digitally driven energy services provider for the real estate sector in Europe with a
strong track record of managing complexity for our customers. This stems from our historically strong
business in submetering as well as significant offerings in energy contracting and other building and
energy related services. We are active in 18 countries, all located in Europe except for Brazil, and hold
top one or top two positions in most of these countries. We believe we are a leading provider in the
European energy services market, in particular in the residential submetering market in Germany where
we believe to have a relative market share of approximately 27% based on revenue for the financial
year ended September 30, 2022, and the largest installed asset base of heat and water meter devices.
While our business is not regulated, it is supported by the regulatory framework our customers face and
we see ourselves as their service provider to help them fulfill growing regulatory requirements.

We organize our business into the two reportable segments: Energy Services, which offers submetering
and cost allocation services, ancillary energy efficiency solutions and supplementary products and
services, and Energy Efficiency Solutions, where we procure, convert and supply energy to our
customers. Energy Services consists of the business operating lines Energy Services Germany and
Energy Services International, which oversees the development and strategy across 17 countries. All of
these countries are located in Europe, with the exception of Brazil. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2023, our Energy Services business segment generated external revenues of €863.8
million. Germany generated 61.0% of these revenues, with the remainder generated by our operations
outside Germany. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, our Energy Efficiency Solutions
business segment generated external revenues of €148.6 million.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we generated revenue of €1,012.5 million. In
addition, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we generated free cash flow of €130.0
million and Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA of €534.6 million.

We leverage our scale, expertise, access to the real estate sector and the large amount of energy
consumption information we compile through submetering to provide additional energy efficiency
solutions and to respond to the shift towards an increasing emphasis on health within properties.
Services include smoke detection, water testing, energy contracting, metering point operations
(“MPO”), digital heat chain (control) (“DHC”) services and electric vehicle charging (“EV Charging”).
We plan to define a new market by introducing a new multi-sensor device (“MSD”) as an alternative to
the classical smoke detector with the replacement cycle in Germany in 2024, developed together with
Vonovia, that comprises smoke detection and climate monitoring (including heat, carbon monoxide and
mold detection) as well as humidity and temperature sensors. Our services are integrated as we bundle
our cloud-based infrastructure, digital infrastructure in properties, and our deep and long-standing
domain expertise in one technologically advanced platform – our One Digital Platform. This platform
is a key enabler for the majority of our offerings.

We believe digitalization is key to achieving climate-neutrality in the real estate sector. Consequently,
we have strategically digitalized our business processes in recent years, building a foundation for
optimizing our increasingly digital service offerings and improving customer satisfaction. We believe
that global digitalization trends will allow us to develop new and attractive value pools as we continue
digitalizing our submetering offering, while continuing to expand our business offerings. Our digital
operating model allows for speed and adaptability in fulfilling regulatory requirements and developing
new digital services, while at the same time reducing human induced errors in the process.

To improve customer satisfaction, we redesigned our business model along customer journeys with a
focus on providing value-added services based on our extensive amount of energy consumption
information. Oftentimes customers turn to us when they face complex regulatory requirements, helping
us to design our products and services in accordance with customer needs. Supported by strong research


-----

and development (“R&D”) and information technology (“IT”) capabilities we have created a digitalized
asset base. It provides us with additional efficiency gains and growth opportunities while
simultaneously yielding an improved customer experience. For example, we believe we have achieved
efficiency gains through our devices (designed to fulfill open metering system (“OMS”)) by providing
significant cost advantages over third-party OMS devices. These cost advantages stem from using
streamlined manufacturing services and bundling volumes for core components. We believe to have
deep expertise, in developing low-power electronics (with a battery lifetime of up to twenty years) that
have a high reliability over their lifetime.

Our track record is supported by the revenue growth at a CAGR of 11.2% over the period from the
financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30, 2023. Our past
financial performance has been supported by ENERGIZE-T, our value creation program introduced in
2018 focusing on quality and performance improvements, our _One Digital Platform, accelerated_
growth, as well as our cultural transformation. Through ENERGIZE-T, we have introduced a systematic
approach to further develop our business, create value for us and our customers and laid the foundation
for further growth.

Demonstrating our sustainability commitment, in April 2023 we achieved an ESG score of 8.7 by
Sustainalytics, rating our sustainability risks as in the lowest risk category “negligible.” This rating
ranks us within the top two percent of all ratings Sustainalytics has currently issued for business support
services companies. See “Business––Sustainability.”

**_Energy Services_**

Within Energy Services, we offer submetering and cost allocation services, smoke detection, water
testing, MPO and, in 2024, we plan to introduce the new smoke detection and climate monitoring
offering which comprises additional services such as climate monitoring as well as humidity and
temperature sensors that allow for mold prevention recommendations. While many of our services are
supported by the tightening regulatory frameworks which our customers face, we have positioned
ourselves as a broad service provider for the real estate sector for further innovative technology-enabled
services such as DHC and EV Charging Some of these products and services, such as the DHC or MPO,
are currently only offered on the German market, partially due to regulatory frameworks (in the case of
MPO) and partially due to our development processes. However, as we generally develop our products
and services for group-wide deployment, we may expand our offering beyond markets in which we are
currently active in.

_Submetering / Cost Allocation Services_

Submetering entails the metering of energy and water consumption of individual units within a multiunit residential or commercial building as well as billing services. Our submetering business is
supported by the EU regulatory framework which requires landlords to meter the consumption of
individual tenants and bill these costs accordingly. At the same time, the readings we obtain through
these services are the basis for some of our ancillary energy efficiency solutions. Submetering enables
our customers to regularly monitor energy and water consumption data and associated costs. Hence,
this offering raises consumption awareness among landlords and tenants who may adjust their
consumption behaviors. We believe that the use of submetering and the related consumption
adjustments can lead to a reduction of energy consumption in multi-dwelling buildings by
approximately 20%.

Globally, we provide submetering services for approximately 13 million residential units and have
installed more than 67 million metering devices (including smoke detectors) as of September 2023,
with 5.8 million devices installed in the financial year ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30,
2023, 82% of our installed devices in Germany were radio enabled and approximately 60% of our
devices were cloud connected.


-----

We also offer the rental and sale of hardware for cost allocation. In particular, we often sell service
contracts as we enter into sale or rental contracts of hardware, while our rental and sales arrangements
are often complemented by service contracts relating to the respective hardware. Hence, our broad
offering provides us with various key revenue streams.

_Smoke detection & climate monitoring_

We offer smoke detection and related services, such as intra-year function controls, with our devices
being connected through our digital infrastructure in a given property (our Techem Fixed Network).
This allows us to generate revenue synergies through cross-selling opportunities with our products and
services in our submetering business. Furthermore, our smoke detection and related services help our
customers comply with regulations related to smoke detection installation.

We plan to introduce our smoke detection and climate monitoring offering with the MSD as a
functionally enhanced alternative, which will include smoke detection and advanced safety features, as
well as value added services such as mold prevention recommendations, air quality measurement with
airing recommendations and continuous monitoring. Due to its advanced features compared to a
conventional smoke detector, we expect to be able to sell the MSD at a price approximately three to
four times of that of a current generation smoke detector. With our plan to sell the MSD in 2024, we
strive to make this device the new industry standard as older smoke detector devices are expected to be
replaced due to regulatory obligations requiring a replacement after a service life of ten years. We
believe that the roll-out of the MSD across our customer base will be supported by an arrangement with
Vonovia pursuant to which we have secured the sale of a significant number of MSDs, and we aim to
provide MSDs to Vonovia’s entire portfolio. As of September 2023, there were approximately 10.3
million smoke detectors installed in individual units, all of which were remotely monitored and
controlled. In the financial year ended September 30, 2023 we generated revenues of approximately
€58.0 million from our smoke detection business.

_Water Testing_

We offer water testing services for legionella prevention from initial inspection to laboratory analysis
in Germany and Austria, leveraging our existing customer base in our submetering business. Our
services, which we provide in cooperation with SGS Fresenius as an independent laboratory, help
customers in fulfilling regulatory standards, such as testing, certificate provision, service for legionella
prevention, analysis and they also provide concrete action recommendations for renovation of the
respective infrastructure. In addition, together with our laboratory partner we provide our customers
with negative tests certifications and reports for health authorities to assist them in demonstrating
compliance with regulations.

_Metering Point Operations_

Through our MPO activities, we are active in the smart metering business for electricity, gas and
(district) heat as we record and transmit consumption data of multiple commodities in our customers’
buildings. Smart metering systems are meters which are connected to a communication network through
a smart meter gateway. Our MPO business allows us to offer integrated metering and submetering
across major utilities ((district) heat, gas and electric power). Our business has been supported by
regulatory changes geared towards a liberalization of the metering market in Germany which allows for
metering systems to also be operated by third parties such as Techem. As a competitive third-party
operator, we are not tied to the price caps for operating a metering point and believe to stand out from
competitors because of our value proposition that goes beyond the legal requirements for installation
and operating of a metering point.

While today our smart meter gateway is used in our MPO business, it could also be used in connection
with our submetering business in the future. Hence, we believe our smart meter gateways address future
regulatory requirements around cross-commodity measurement as they connect all metering devices in


-----

a dwelling and create transparency about all energy consumption as an important prerequisite for
optimizing energy consumption and purchasing.

In Germany, smart metering systems for electricity are a regulatory requirement from 2025 onwards for
end-users who have an annual electricity consumption over 6,000 kWh and a controllable consumption
device (such as an electric heat pump). Furthermore, smart metering systems have to be installed for
operators with an electricity generation capacity of more than 7 kW. Smart metering systems are to be
installed throughout Germany from 2032.

In addition to enabling decarbonization strategies in our serviced buildings, we expect that MPO will
form the basis for further integration of renewable, intermittent energy sources to the grid and will be a
key tool for demand-side management. As of today, MPO provides energy consumption data. However,
in the future we believe that energy demand control signals will also be transmitted through MPO to
synchronize the generation of fluctuating renewable energy sources with the consumption of the
building. We believe that MPO will enable us to offer diverse, digital, and flexible business models,
such as landlord to tenant electricity supply models, for the energy transition in the real estate sector.

In combination with our digital submetering infrastructure, connecting all metering devices through
smart readers (data collectors) and MPO energy consumption data and contract information, we can
offer monthly, rather than annual, billing options. This allows us to offer a holistic view of a building's
exact energy consumption on a high-frequency basis. This would result in increased transparency of
energy and heat consumption which in turn enables transparency on energy costs and CO2 emissions.

_Digital Heat Chain_

Our DHC service provides an innovative solution to make the operational status of heat generation
systems for multi-dwelling buildings more transparent. See “Business ––Energy Efficiency Solutions.”
We launched this service for customers in the second half of 2023. With DHC, temperature and meter
data are collected from the central heat generation system and then transmitted into the cloud. In
combination with other data, property-specific models can be trained and mapped to a digital twin of
the respective heat generation system. This provides customers with an overview of the current status
of their systems. Through DHC we can swiftly provide specific recommendations to reduce energy
consumption and CO2 emissions by optimizing the setting of the generation system as well as reliable
notifications about malfunctions and failures in their systems. We developed our DHC service drawing
on our many years of experience in submetering, energy efficiency analytics of buildings and the
application of modern AI technologies. These analytics provide actionable recommendations for a more
efficient and safer operation of heating systems. Furthermore, the DHC comprises machine-learning
technology that further contributes to a continuous optimization of its analyses.

We believe that the DHC forms a relevant part of a building’s decarbonization strategy. We offer DHC
either standalone or bundled with energy contracting solutions. In addition to energy saving potentials
driven by a mere adjustment of consumption behavior (such as through use of submetering services and
the related consumption adjustments), the DHC enables for significant optimization of existing heating
systems, energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This results in an additional energy saving potential
of approximately 15% at relatively low incremental cost for our customers. Our service works
regardless of the type, manufacturer, or age of central heat generation system and it is functional across
energy sources. This means that we can provide solutions for installation independently of the type of
boiler and other hardware installed. DHC solutions use a similar digital infrastructure as our
submetering services which provides us with efficiency gains and reliable technology.

_EV Charging_

Given our long-standing experience with data-handling, energy consumption and billing, we offer a
comprehensive service for EV Charging stations in multi-dwelling and commercial buildings, with a
focus on Germany. Through EV Charging, we aim to make an active contribution to the expansion and


-----

servicing of primarily privately owned EV Charging infrastructure. Our EV Charging service comprises
sourcing, installation, commissioning and operation of the charging infrastructure (as a rental or sales
model), with a particular focus on remote monitoring, user management and billing as well as
maintenance services. We provide largely standardized billing services based on actual customer usage
of the shared infrastructure and manage access and tariff configuration on behalf of our customers. EV
Charging stations are digitally connected to a back-end platform and to our shared IT-infrastructure.
Most of our services are based on a digital data connection and setup, allowing transparency in tracking
connected charging points. Our main revenue streams for EV Charging are service fees for multi-user
billing, and subscription and rental fees for the operation of charging stations.

Since 2022, we have been executing a project for the German Institute for Federal Real Estate
(Bundesanstalt für Immobilienaufgaben, BImA) whereby we aim to install, operate, and bill up to 1,000
charging stations for electric vehicles in more than 250 properties on behalf of them. As of September
2023, we have installed approximately 700 EV Charging points.

**_Energy Efficiency Solutions_**

Through Energy Efficiency Solutions, we offer energy contracting and energy consulting services to
customers in Germany. This business builds on our expertise in managing energy consumption and
leverages the extensive market understanding and real estate sector expertise we have gained over the
past decades. Energy Efficiency Solutions further benefits from our experience in heat curve behavior
and optimization, which enables us to run heating systems at high efficiency without impacting the
comfort of end-users.

The energy contracting services mainly include the planning and design, financing, energy provisioning
and operation (management and billing) of heating and cooling solutions. We typically involve third
parties for the commodity sourcing and the installation of these solutions. These projects are generally
customer-specific and tailored to the needs of the individual building and customer.

In recent years, we have shifted to focus on providing customers with primarily green and sustainable
technology (i.e., heat pumps) and addressing specific building requirements (e.g., less energy-efficient
buildings) with bivalent solutions (heat pump combined with gas boilers for peak demand). Today, we
offer renewable energy supply solutions with a usage of a minimum of 65% renewable energy as the
average target. In alignment with our sustainability goals, we offer new contracting customers primarily
renewable energy supply solutions, and we aim to renew existing contracts only with contracts that
include a renewable energy component. The energy management systems we offer comply with
ISO 50001 and are therefore a key instrument for the continuous and sustainable energy optimization
and decarbonization of our customers’ heating and supply systems.

We believe that the energy contracting market in Germany is much more fragmented than the
submetering and cost-allocation market. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we operate
approximately 3,000 heating systems for our customers. Our leading position in the submetering market
in Germany enables us to benefit from synergies, for instance, with regard to our market access efforts.
Furthermore, it allows for multiple cross-selling opportunities as we provide our customers with fully
integrated solutions across both Energy Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions.

In addition, we provide energy consulting services. These include assisting landlords, property
managers and other customers in their energy management with offerings such as energy monitoring
solutions and services to enhance cost and energy efficiency in light of ongoing decarbonization efforts.
We believe these consulting services are highly important to our customers in the real estate sector, as
the regulatory landscape on energy provision becomes increasingly complex to navigate.

Consistent with rising energy costs and tighter regulations, we see a growing demand for cost effective,
high-impact solutions. In connection with the cross-selling opportunities, we continue to leverage our
submetering and cost allocation services with our contracting and energy consulting expertise to offer


-----

further solutions to buildings already serviced by us. For example, we have developed solutions that
connect heating room optimization solutions with the demands of individual apartments and building
units. In addition, we believe that the decarbonization of buildings can only be achieved with the help
of its users and residents, thus, we aim to develop unobtrusive solutions with a high degree of acceptance
and user convenience.

**Our Strengths**

We hold top one or top two positions in most of the 18 countries we are active in. In our home market
Germany, we are market leader in heat and water submetering services. We aim to achieve a high level
of social relevance through our services, such as enabling a usage-based allocation of energy costs
(primarily in the provision of heat and water), thus inducing a monetary incentive for conscious
consumption. This relevance became evident in the 1970s as oil prices spiked, leading to the first
German Heating Cost Ordinance (Heizkostenverordnung) in 1981. This type of regulation has since
been adopted and further developed by the EU and implemented in most of its Member States, such as
the Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency (EED), amended in 2018 to introduced requirements for
providing monthly consumption information.

Increased awareness around sourcing of renewable energy considering the political and regulatory
discussion on climate change, as well as efforts to decrease reliance on fossil fuels, recently particularly
in the EU in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which started in February 2022 (the “RussiaUkraine War”), has driven an increased shift towards conscious consumption of energy.

We believe we play a vital role in supporting the real estate sector in achieving decarbonization goals
and fulfilling regulatory obligations. Closely related to the submetering service, we have developed a
number of energy efficiency services that all aim at facilitating the reduction of energy consumption in
properties, such as our DHC that allows for digital monitoring of existing heat systems in properties,
and EV Charging. Our contracting business also focuses on decarbonization strategies.

We also support our customers to comply with ever more demanding regulatory requirements. For
example, in the context of the German Carbon Dioxide Cost Allocation Act
(Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz) and the energy cost relief programs, according to which the
proportion of heating and water costs borne by the landlord depends on the energy efficiency of the
respective residential building, it has become mandatory to specify in a heating cost bill the share of
costs to be borne by the tenant and the landlord respectively. Similarly, we are providing smoke
detection services, since, for example, it is mandatory in Germany for landlords to provide smoke
detectors and ensure their functionality within a rented residential property.

Expanding submetering into smart metering services, which can provide continuous and timely
monitoring of energy generation and consumption, increases awareness for energy usage, during
periods of high energy demand.

With our _One Digital Platform we bundle our digital metering technology, digital infrastructure in_
properties (our Techem Fixed Network), cloud infrastructures and our core systems (such as our own
developed billing engine HZ/3, our digital customer portal my.techem as well as data exchange systems)
with our long-standing domain expertise in metering, energy consumption and the real estate sector.
Overall, we believe to be well-positioned at the intersection of three of the global megatrends, i.e.,
digitalization, decarbonization and urbanization providing energy efficiency services on our
outstanding One Digital Platform.

**_Pan-European market leader with stronghold in the German submetering market_**

We are one of the leading submetering providers in Europe where we hold top one or top two positions
in most of the 18 countries in which we operate. We believe to be one of only two submetering providers
with a strong international market presence. Our international business is tightly connected to our home


-----

market in Germany, leveraging economies of skill and scale developed and improved on in the German
market. This position is enabled through our device development and our One Digital Platform, global
purchasing, and production power, as well as cross-selling synergies.

We believe that our strong pan-European presence enables us to capture additional market share from
the increasing regulatory-supported submetering roll-out in many EU markets, while having the
technical, digital infrastructure to remotely service millions of existing devices.

**_Tech-enabled energy management pioneer delivering measurable customer benefit_**

We have transformed our business through digitalization and invested significantly into our core assets:
people and technology. Our digital value proposition is transforming the customer journey, while
increasing the efficiency and scalability of our business model. For example, a key capability and
strength is our ability to dynamically adapt our services to rapidly changing regulatory requirements.
We believe our proprietary billing engine HZ/3 to be the leading system in the industry. It is our
cornerstone for transactional data processing in billing. Furthermore, we believe we have been amongst
the leaders for radio-technology deployment in our sector. As of September 2023, approximately 82%
of our devices in Germany were using radio-based transmission, and approximately 60% of our devices
were cloud connected as of September 30, 2023. As of January 2024, properties in Germany with a
reading date on December 31 amounted to 304,462 compared to 299,300 in January 2022. As of January
2024, 86% of devices connected to smart readers were ready for billing within approximately ten
working days after the start of the peak winter service period on January 1st compared to 71% in January
2022, i.e., 63% of all properties (including with and without smart meters) in 2024 compared to 46% in
2022.

We believe that digitalization and open, interoperable systems go hand in hand. Thus, we have
embraced the vendor independent communication OMS standards. With approximately 56.4 million
OMS devices in use as of September 30, 2022, we believe we are one of the largest operators of OMS
devices in submetering and we strongly promote the use of this open standard.

Our highly connected digitalized asset base of approximately 67 million devices as of September 2023,
and the technological capabilities to manage complexity at scale are the starting point to expand into
other adjacent areas by providing ancillary services, such as holistic energy management solutions as
well as recently launched offerings, such as MPO, where in the German market we support customers
preparing for future regulatory requirements as these systems are to be installed throughout Germany
from 2032.

We believe our data and digital capabilities are leading in the submetering market and stand out in the
European energy services industry. Our market position today is a result of our significant investments
into the right expertise and the achievements of our digital teams, including _Techem X, our digital_
strategy lab, which we founded to drive customer journey-led digital product and service design and
development.

We believe that our refined digitalized operating model has led to measurable benefits for customers,
such as improved service, a reduced error rate and an increase in delivery time all of which is reflected
in reduced amounts of complaints and inquiries, resulting in low customer churn rates.

**_Highly resilient, infrastructure-like business with strong support by regulatory trends_**

The submetering market is non-cyclical, with inherent macroeconomic and political stability offering a
solid base for a resilient financial performance, in particular as submetering is an essential service
required by law in most of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

The general market resilience is supported by the EU and national regulatory frameworks, where many
of our core services help our customers to comply with regulatory obligations. The megatrends of
decarbonization and urbanization give us regulatory support and we believe that it provides us with a


-----

growing market opportunity in the future. Furthermore, we believe that laws are shifting to require
greater transparency in the real estate sector around utility consumption (i.e., heat, water, and power),
which our products and services are well suited to provide. The global temperature increase limit
committed by the Paris Agreement drives this need for the building sector, as approximately 40% of
greenhouse gas emissions in Germany stem from the building sector. This is expected to result in
increasing regulation and the decarbonization of the heating systems as the real estate sector aims to
become more environment friendly. Central boiler rooms in multi-family homes are today based on gas,
oil, or fossil fuel district heat. These systems, over time, will need to be replaced by renewable, carbonfree energy sources. Today we see a clear path to use heat pumps powered by green solar energy from
photovoltaic systems in most multi-family houses. We are able to provide users with this technology
through our green contracting business.

Additionally, we believe that new opportunities will arise for us as individual heating solutions in multifamily homes, such as single-story gas heaters in apartments, will be replaced by central, green heating
systems, such as heat pumps. This leads to additional necessity of cost and consumption allocation
through submetering. In addition, increasing urbanization leads to a growing market of multi-dwelling
buildings, further increasing the potential for submetering as these services are often required at the unit
level, thus increasing the number of devices in use.

Our water testing business in Germany is supported by the Drinking Water Ordinance
(Trinkwasserverordnung), which requires testing for legionella in multi-dwelling units with central hot
water systems. Similarly, our smoke detection business in Germany is supported by the building codes
of the German states.

General business resilience is driven by long-term customer loyalty and a low churn rate of
approximately 2% as of September 2023. Some customer relationships have lasted for significantly
more than 20 years, and we occasionally have customer relationships for more than 40 years. We have
a low customer concentration, with the top 10 customers in Energy Services Germany representing
approximately 6% of revenue, and our top 30 customers less than 10% of revenue, in each case for the
financial year ended September 30, 2023.

These external factors align with our own operational resilience, based on our outstanding One Digital
Platform, a lean operating model and strict steering based on our measurable key performance
indicators, which we have defined. Given our focus on digitalization of our services, we believe that
this will further strengthen the attractiveness of our services to our customers.

**_We have a resilient financial profile with predictable cash flows and consistent growth_**

Our financial strength is based on our attractive economic model, the strong resilience supported by a
stable and robust market environment, our service offerings based on our redesigned operating model,
high visibility of future financial performance already today, as well as our past financial success on
the back of our investments in our _One Digital Platform, which enables us to react quickly to our_
customers’ evolving requirements and at the same time provides further opportunities to offer additional
value-added services.

Our economic model is based on our customer portfolio, which we believe to be well-diversified leading
to a low customer concentration, coupled with high customer loyalty based on long-term customer
relationships, and decreasing customer churn. This is further supported by the recurring nature of our
business due to the regulatory requirements our customers face and our services address. In addition,
today we enjoy the benefits of a lean cost structure and ability to scale, which in turn both allows for a
high operating leverage to capture economies of scale and to utilize the investments we made into our
_One Digital Platform across a large number of customers served and devices operated in Germany and_
abroad. In addition, we have a track record of high re-forecast accuracy. In each of the financial years
ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, our actual EBITDA deviated less than 1% compared to our
re-forecasted EBITDA.


-----

For over 15 years, our financials have shown a combination of both revenue and EBITDA growth as
we successfully withstood all major societal, political, and macroeconomic cycles and upheavals,
including the financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine War, and the subsequent
energy cost crisis, and did not experience a single year in which our EBITDA declined. At the same
time, we expanded our margin, which demonstrates our financial resilience. In addition, we have also
recently demonstrated our ability to accelerate growth on the back of the regulatory tailwind and the
successful implementation of our strategic and operational initiatives, by increasing revenue at a CAGR
of 11.2% from the financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30,
2023 and achieving growth across our segments and across our German and international portfolio.
During the same period our EBITDA accelerated and grew by a CAGR of 6.9% while Adjusted
EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 5.8%.

**_Complementary management team with deep expertise and strategic vision_**

Our management team has a strategic vision, a proven track record and demonstrated expertise in
digitalization, sustainability, transformation, and the real estate sector.

Matthias Hartmann joined in early 2020 as Chief Executive Officer to drive our digital and cultural
transformation. Mr. Hartmann previously held CEO positions at IBM DACH (Germany, Austria, and
Switzerland) and at GfK SE. Dr.-Ing. Carsten Sürig joined in March 2019 as Chief Financial Officer
(and Chief Performance Officer until June 2023) to drive performance and financial management, as
well as our holistic value creation program ENERGIZE-T. Dr. Sürig was previously a Managing Partner
at McKinsey & Company, Inc. Nicolai Kuß joined in December 2016 as Chief Operating Officer. Since
March 2019, he has been responsible for sales and customer service and has most recently taken over
the holistic leadership for the operational business in Germany as Chief Sales Officer. Mr. Kuß
previously held top management positions at large German real estate companies.

In recent years, we have looked to hire top talent with the skills and expertise required to help us succeed
and grow in our sector and beyond. We have transformed our company culture towards a more agile
organization, with an operating model focusing on customer centricity and invested heavily in our
digital transformation and data capabilities.

Overall, we have managed to attract leadership for the second and third executive levels from a wide
range of backgrounds, sectors and with diverse experiences. Our strong commitment to our vision of
making buildings green, smart, and healthy and advancing our sustainability goals, has become part of
our strategy. This commitment is a key driver for us while additionally serving as an attractor for top
talent.

**Our Strategy**

To achieve our vision to make our customers’ buildings green, smart, and healthy, we have set ourselves
a strategy targeting sustainable growth and increasing value for our stakeholders. We aim at
continuously increasing our efficiency and quality of services to reach an unrivalled customer
experience and thus satisfaction. We offer digitally enabled, ancillary energy services from various
growth opportunities in our core business and beyond.

**_Delivering outstanding customer experience through digital platform and streamlined processes_**

Our strategy is anchored around significantly increasing customer experience and to step-change the
way our customers experience submetering and adjacent services. We believe that changing the way
how submetering services were provided for a long period of time and focusing on customer satisfaction
are important prerequisites to be successful in the future and to capture the significant potential arising
from the digitalization of the industry.

We have therefore significantly invested in our digital platform and processes to offer an improved
customer journey and to deliver superior service outcomes. We have put the customer at the center of


-----

our business and redesigned our operating model and processes along the customer journey to tangibly
enhance our customers’ experience. Offering higher quality service and clear convenience benefits has
removed some former pain points customers had experienced and has allowed us to earn a positive net
promoter score (“NPS”). In addition, we have managed to materially reduce our customer churn from
4% in the financial year 2019 to 2% by the financial year 2023, a strong testimony to our improved
service offering.

**_Increasing the digital penetration of properties with digitalization and efficiency offerings_**

Our goal is to further increase the digital penetration of properties under service in the medium term.
We believe to lead the market with a high digitalization rate of approximately 82% (share of our devices
in Germany using radio-based transmission as of September 2023) and which grew from 76% as of
September 30, 2019. We aim to increase this rate to almost 100% by 2027. An increased digitalization
creates the opportunity to automate and change key processes and to provide our core services much
faster and better, which are essential elements to increase the customer satisfaction through process
efficiencies. We plan to further optimize our operating model along the customer journey, leading to
further increased efficiency, as we aim to deliver even higher on-time delivery and reduced correction
quotas.

We aim to continue leveraging the power of data analytics and AI to drive efficiency and at the same
time create greater customer value, competitive differentiation, and growth opportunities. For instance,
with our One Digital Platform, we expect to achieve high growth rates and a rapid development-tomarket cycle of new services. Our goal is to help customers in real estate fulfil new regulatory
requirements they face in a swift and efficient manner.

In the past years we have started our transformation journey of process standardization and automation,
which we will continue to pursue in the future. We are convinced that this will lead to further costreducing economies of scale primarily through the continued extension and development of digital
solutions, adaptable to all our current and future markets. Our approach to standardization and
automation has also enabled us avoiding business performance bottlenecks we faced in peak times.

We plan to gradually reduce repetitive work in our offering and to increase the share of high-value,
digital tasks. This shift is supported by our holistic digital learning platform Techem Academy with
comprehensive training offerings, that has already won multiple external awards. This way, we aim to
further increase our attractiveness on the labor markets and to be a sought-after employer for top
employees and talents despite the shortage of skilled workers.

**_Seizing multiple growth opportunities across segments_**

We believe that the continued public and private focus to decarbonize heat production and optimize
energy efficiency in the real estate sector will require additional services to achieve these goals. We aim
to capture this potential and accelerate our growth by rolling out leading energy efficiency solutions
across markets at scale, further positioning us as the partner of choice across solutions for our real estate
customers. We believe that this trend of optimization of energy efficiency has already contributed to
our past Energy Efficiency Solutions growth, contributing to revenue growth at a CAGR of 27.3% over
the period of the financial year ended September 30, 2021 to the financial year ended September 30,
2023, among other factors. We expect to maintain continued high growth benefiting from our
investments into digitalization, the operating model and our customer-centric approach.

In Energy Services, we expect our business in and outside Germany to benefit from various factors. We
believe to be able to participate from the ongoing implementation and enforcement of the EED which
will result in an expansion of opportunities in submetering across our European markets. To this end,
we aim to utilize our One Digital Platform for our respective solutions and to scale direct billing and
our digital sales channels. Furthermore, we expect to continuously drive service revenue per dwelling
based on our digitally enabled value-added services. In Germany we expect extended opportunities in


-----

submetering in the commercial real estate sector, as digital measurements and recordings of the carbon
footprint will allow addressing regulatory pressure more quickly. We have also developed a new multisensor device (MSD), with which we aim at creating a new market next to the smoke detection only
devices. We believe to be well placed to create this opportunity and are planning to sell this device in
the course of 2024, thereby also utilizing the upcoming replacement cycle. Furthermore, our existing
submetering customer base in Germany provides us with additional upside to expand our water testing
services. In addition to organic growth, we aim to continue our successful track record of dedicated
accretive acquisitions of smaller submetering companies to consolidate the fragmented tail of markets
in which we operate.

The digitalization of our core business also presents opportunities in our new business areas such as the
field of multi-commodity and smart energy efficiency solutions. We see opportunities around the next
development stages of our DHC, such as scaling our offering across further markets, including new
functions and services, as well as metering service offerings for all types of consumption across all
properties. We plan to tap into this potential through our MPO business strongly enforced by the
digitalization and decarbonization goals of the German government. We also aim at growing the
services for planning, installing, and operating EV Charging stations as e-mobility is expected to
become more widespread. Lastly, we aim at expanding our white label offerings around our One Digital
_Platform, as we provide its billing functionalities to smaller submetering players, housing providers and_
municipal utilities who lack digital capabilities.

We expect Energy Efficiency Solutions to grow as we will continue focusing on green solutions based
on sustainable, electricity-based technologies (e.g., heat pumps, photovoltaic systems) complemented
by our digital metering capabilities. As we aim for a largely climate-neutral inventory of existing
buildings in Germany, we plan to convert all our existing fossil fuel heating systems to decarbonized
heat supply systems by 2045 and to win larger customer portfolios through strategic decarbonization.

**History and Key Milestones**

We were founded in 1952 by Friedrich Ott and Heinrich Luley in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, as a
company for the evaluation of technical-chemical processes and patents. Techem was one of the first
companies to contribute to distributing heating costs fairly according to tenants’ energy consumption –
and thus, to saving energy – by recording the individual heat consumption in dwellings. At the time,
the metering of heat consumption by evaporator tubes was still the method of choice and metering was
not yet obligatory by regulation.

The industry experienced development in the late 1970s, as the first and second oil crisis massively
increased the public and political awareness for energy saving and energy efficiency matters. During
this time, Techem started to grow internationally through acquisitions in Austria in 1978 and
Luxembourg in 1980. High energy costs at that time led to the first regulations requiring landlords to
meter consumption and allocate costs accordingly. We also experienced the first technology push as we
introduced electronic heat cost allocators (“HCA”) to the market in 1983.

We have been offering energy contracting services since 1992. In 1996, we introduced the radio system
for recording consumption digitally. In addition, in the 1990s, we founded multiple subsidiaries in
Poland (1992), Czechia, Hungary, Slovakia (each in 1993), Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland (each in
1995), Belgium (1997) and Bulgaria (1999).

As part of our mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) approach, we continued our international expansion
with an acquisition in France in 2001 and the incorporation of subsidiaries in Romania (2002), with
further countries following, such as Brazil and Denmark in 2006, and Norway and Spain in 2014.

In 2005, we launched remote reading tools via mobile communications and in 2007 added wireless
smoke detectors to the product portfolio. In 2009, we launched the Techem Smart System (“TSS”)


-----

which today in its latest version forms the basis of the digital backbone of all related energy services
(Techem Fixed Network).

As a service provider who knows the customers’ buildings and has a regular presence on-site, our
customers often proactively seek our assistance in responding to new regulatory obligations, such as
obligations to provide smoke detection services in residential properties. Thus, over the past two
decades, we expanded our range of services to include smoke detection services in 2007 and to include
water testing in 2012. In 2020, we started to offer renewable energy generation and in 2021, we entered
the MPO market. This was followed that same year by the launch of EV Charging. In 2023, we launched
our DHC service, based on a solution we had developed for the internal use in our contracting business.

Since 2020, we further accelerated our digital transformation, founding Techem X as a digital strategy
lab to accelerate the development of customer-centric digital services and additionally support the
cultural transformation of our company. Since then, we have attracted significant talent from the areas
of user experience, service design and development. In 2023, we added further top skills in the area of
data science in order to extend our capabilities in data analytics and AI. Given the continuous growth
of our data assets, these skills are essential to further expand our digital services for our customers.

In 2021, we launched two new digital developments that have been enabled by our digital
transformation which we believe provide customers with a superior digital offering. A new digital
billing service Techem Billing Direct significantly reduces the processing time for heat cost bills from
weeks to minutes. We believe that the reduction of processing time is a groundbreaking development
within the submetering industry. The digital transformation further enabled us to develop _Techem_
_Direct, a digital sales channel enabling customers to receive an offer from us within a few clicks and_
steps fully online.

In recent years, our transformation has been rapid to align with developments in the industry. Today,
we experience an even stronger culmination of crises than in the 1970s. The real estate sector lags
behind its decarbonization targets, energy prices increased significantly and general costs of living rose
recently.

We are ready to contribute to solutions for many of these challenges. We believe that our capabilities
as a digitally driven energy service provider to make buildings green, smart and healthy elevate us
beyond a traditional submetering company.

**Digitalization and One Digital Platform: Our Enabling Devices and Technologies**

Our business combines our submetering business with various complementary products and services.
Most of these solutions and services utilize our One Digital Platform, allowing customers to benefit
from a single point of contact and integrated holistic experience. This platform is based on our digital
metering devices, market-leading cloud-based technology, our proprietary billing system _HZ/3 and_
other application systems such as our digital customer portal my.techem. Our expert knowledge in the
domain of R&D for device development, energy data and metering expertise complements the digital
strength of our One Digital Platform.

Most of our devices operate using our Techem Fixed Network which allows us to interconnect these
digital devices, monitor the stability of the heat system, reduce data inconsistencies, and decrease the
time-to-market for our services. A significant advantage of using our Techem Fixed Network system is
that it enables us to access and receive data from metering devices in configurable intervals, allowing
us to create value by combining different data points. Based on this underlying cloud-based system, we
add our knowledge in real estate and energy efficiency to build and enhance our products and services
for our customers.


-----

Furthermore, we leverage a large set of energy consumption data to help our customers with the energy
transition of buildings. We regard our digital capabilities as the core and basis for a successful energy
transition in the real estate sector and the heat transition.

We believe that digitalization enables a fundamentally different customer experience, leading to
measurable increases in our operational efficiency and forming the basis for rapid adaptation to new
regulations and entrance of adjacent markets, such as multi-commodity services.

Furthermore, digitalization enables us to rebalance resources and activities more effectively during the
billing season, resulting in an improved productivity and a shift to issue-driven management. For
example, continuous functionality monitoring of our infrastructure and devices allows us to detect
issues directly instead of only at the time of reading the devices.

For our success in the market, the collaboration among our research (in particular TRIOS, see “––
_Research & Product Development”), development (device and firmware development) and IT_
departments is essential to extend our leadership position with our One Digital Platform.
_Devices_

We use advanced metering devices as the basis for our submetering and ancillary energy efficiency
solutions, and we offer devices to meter heating consumption as well as devices to meter water and
cooling consumption. We rely on third parties to develop, manufacture, and assemble these devices.
Many devices that are relevant for our core business, or have proprietary specifications, are produced
exclusively for us, according to our specifications, which draw on our R&D expertise. To be a reliable
partner for our customers we have stable, long-term contractual relationships with our suppliers,
development, and manufacturing partners. This approach also reduces production costs while ensuring
a high technological standard and reliability, enabling us to apply our low-power-consumption
embedded electronics expertise which is crucial as our metering devices are generally battery powered.

As a key driver for customer-centricity, we are making use of open systems based on open standards as
the most beneficial technological path for customers and tenants on the one hand and as the basis for a
mass market with broad supply in components and solutions on the other hand. This leads to a broad
competitive component and device supplier basis. This is why we have been promoting the adoption of
OMS across our industry. OMS are vendor-independent standards for communication, enabling
interoperability between metering products. We believe we are currently operating the largest number
of OMS compliant devices in the energy services industry in all of our operating countries. Hence, we
see ourselves as leader in OMS technology and are capable of reading a large amount of third-party
devices positioning us ideally to gain market share through our customer experience, service quality
and digital offerings. As a founding member of the German industry association OMS-Group e.V., we
believe to be well positioned to further contribute to this development.

_Heating Consumption_

We offer two types of submetering devices to meter heating consumption. HCA and heat meters are
devices that meter heating consumption for buildings and their individual units. In addition, we have
expanded our product portfolio with a smart reader device that collects and transmits the data of all
installed devices in a property.

- HCAs allocate heat costs to enable a consumption-based billing process. HCAs are available
as electronic devices (or in the past, as evaporators) which are directly installed onto radiators
within our customers’ buildings. Electronic HCAs meter the heat emitted by a radiator through
electronic sensors and digitally display the consumption amount. Nearly all our electronic
HCAs are equipped with radio transmitters which transfers consumption data from an
individual radiator to a smart reader which collects data from all HCAs in a given property. In
contrast, evaporators meter the heat emitted by a radiator based on the amount of liquid
contained in the device that evaporates during the heating period. As evaporators are non

-----

electronic devices, it requires onsite personnel to collect consumption data values. Our
electronic HCAs have a usable lifespan of 15 to 18 years, depending on the content they
transmit and transmission interval. Evaporator liquid, in contrast, needs to be replaced annually
and evaporators, in general, are legally required to be phased out by the end of 2026 in
Germany. In addition to using our submetering infrastructure, we also use HCAs as temperature
sensors in DHC monitoring.

- Heat meters meter thermal energy provided by a given heat source and are available in various
versions to suit the needs of our customers, as some use floor heating, central heating, radiobased systems, or heating systems that are not easily accessible. Typically, one device per
individual unit or flat is used. In addition, heat meters are often also attached to the central
water pipe that provides heating for dwellings. One device per heat exchanger is required for
hot water supply, so one device per property is required. Standard heat meters distributed by us
include an integrated radio module for the wireless transmission of data. In several of the
countries we are active in, heat meters are subject to calibration requirements and must be
replaced or recalibrated regularly. For example, in Germany, heat meters must be replaced or
recalibrated every six years. Alongside our standard heat meters with integrated radio module,
we also distribute meters with a wired connectivity module or pulse interface or a plug-in radio
module.

_Water Consumption_

For metering cold and warm water consumption, we offer water meters in multiple variants depending
on customer needs and installation requirements. All water meters are installed in the piping system of
a building and consumption is displayed in cubic meters (with one device for warm and one for cold
water). Water meters are installed in individual units within a building, enabling customers to track
water usage for individual tenants and bill according to those tenants’ respective consumption habits.
Standard water meters distributed by us are equipped with a clip-on radio module.

In several countries, water meters are subject to mandatory calibration requirements and, therefore,
must be replaced or recalibrated regularly. In Germany, for example, the recalibration period required
by law is six years for both hot and cold-water meters.

_Cooling Consumption_

We deliver meters to customers specifically designed for installation in cooling circuits, with the
purpose of recording cooling consumption. Standard cold meters have an integrated radio module, and
certain cold meters are equipped with slots for a plug-in radio module and additional slots for wired
connectivity modules like a wired meter-bus for increased remote reading and signal processing
capabilities. Such wired interface allows the connection to a wired system and is often used for very
large installations, offering the possibility for high frequency and on-demand data readings. In addition,
combination devices offering both cold and heat meter function in one device are available, for example,
to be used in heat pump systems that also provide cooling functions.

_Smoke Detection & Climate Monitoring_

We believe we are leading in the distribution and installation of smoke detectors for multi-dwelling
buildings. In the German market, we were the first to offer smoke detectors that had the capability for
self-surveillance, which can be remotely monitored over the entire ten-year battery life. Regulation in
Germanys requires, among others, regular and automatic checks of a smoke sensor’s functions and its
surroundings. Smoke detectors without this self-surveillance functionality must be checked on site on
an annual basis. Thus, remote monitoring provides us with a commercial advantage as it enables us to
report critical data to customers and tenants quickly and more efficiently than traditional devices. Our
semi-monthly function control metering capabilities are exceeding regulatory obligations and provide
an additional layer of security for tenants.


-----

Along with our remote-monitored smoke detectors, we are introducing our MSD in 2024 which has
been designed together with one of our largest customers. This MSD combines traditional smoke
detector features and remote monitoring with climate monitoring (including heat and carbon monoxide
detection), as well as humidity and temperature sensors that allow for mold prevention and indoor
climate features. Combining obligatory smoke detection with mold prevention recommendations for
landlords enables us to offer a competitive value proposition for a high-end device and service in a mass
market.

_Smart Readers_

As a collector and communication interface for all consumption related data, smart readers are required
to provide fully digitalized cost allocation services. Acting as an interface to submeters and sensors,
smart readers collect the metered consumption data from the radio enabled devices installed in that
building and transmit this data to our cloud-based control center. Smart readers allow for flexible remote
reading and can record and transmit readings at a higher frequency (i.e., on a monthly, semi-monthly,
or even daily basis, as opposed to annually). In addition, smart readers can monitor the battery status
and potential defects of connected individual submeters. Furthermore, through OMS interoperability,
our smart readers can integrate data from third-party metering devices that use OMS-radio transmission.
Using OMS interoperable devices enables quick time-to-market through easier integration into our
_Techem Fixed Network and device databases on a broad supplier basis._

With our Techem Fixed Network, the infrastructure of radio enabled devices, smart readers, and our
cloud network, we securely collect and forward data from our devices through our smart readers (data
collectors) in our customers’ buildings. Our advanced data collectors, allow for a variety of use cases.
The most relevant collector is the battery powered Techem Smart System 3 which is easy to install and
has a battery lifespan of approximately eight years, depending on readout intervals and number of
covered devices. Batteries are exchangeable in the field. Approximately 58% of our devices were cloud
connected as of as of September 30, 2023 (compared to 11% as of September 30, 2019) allowing for
fully remote reading and further rollout is ongoing. Fully remote readable buildings can have their
submetering data read daily, allowing for further use cases to be developed. We also offer powerconnected collectors that allow for high-frequency data transmission use cases, e.g., transmission in
intervals of 15 minutes for heat generation monitoring.

Alternatives to remote data reading include walk-by data collection, where personnel equipped with a
mobile reader can gather the data from street level or hallways without entering the individual units. If
the metering devices are not equipped with a radio module, we use a readout by having instructed
personnel entering individual units to record necessary data.

**Information Technology**

Many energy services providers face challenges associated with increasing regulation and the high
speed of digitalization developments. We believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges. In
recent years, we have made substantial investments into our digital capabilities, i.e., IT applications,
infrastructure, and team expertise to benefit from opportunities arising from further digitalization at
scale in our markets.

We focus on seamless connectivity of our devices in buildings supported by our One Digital Platform
located in data centers or in the cloud. Our transactional software solution HZ/3 is a key differentiator
as it provides for a high degree of adaptability and automation. High volume, smart data processing is
at the heart of all our IT efforts and key to data-driven services and process automation including AI.

Our IT relies on our in-house capabilities with agile, integrated IT and business teams as well as cooperations with technology partners. All our IT systems have been designed for robustness and to
provide for high levels of information security resilience.

**_Enabling IT_**

We collect data for further management and analysis from the devices in our customers’ buildings onto
our cloud or data center through our fully automated Techem Fixed Network or through manual walkby collection. Once collected, we combine this consumption data with additional internal and external
data sources. For example, we combine master data from buildings with the collected reading data or
use weather data to adjust our devices and gain further insights around heat generation and consumption.
As we collect data with increasing frequency and with an increased set of devices, our database is
growing in variety and size. We currently collect data through more than 4 billion readings per year. To
achieve efficient processing and further develop our data and AI capabilities, we have established a
cooperation with Microsoft’s Azure as our cloud software and hardware provider that combines the
required big data and AI technology with enhanced security and data privacy. We make our data
available through a growing set of interfaces. This eases internal software development as well as data
exchanges with customers and partners.

The growth in data and data-driven customer services is safeguarded with modern technology. All data
from devices in a given building is checked for correctness with automated outlier detection of missing
data or data for which its certainty and correctness is at doubt. The DHC is a strong demonstration of
scaled-out data processing on Azure cloud with AI where machine learning algorithms automatically
detect improvement potential or malfunctions of heat generation systems. We also use algorithms as we
perform plausibility checks for our reading services and apply these algorithms also for our billing
solutions. Specifically, we apply approximately 800 context sensitive validation rules to control the
quality of the billing documents, and thereby manage more than two billion datapoints per year for
billing and smoke detection services. This includes consistency checks with regard to the data entered
by the customer and a comparison with the results from previous periods.

When it comes to turning data into billing services for our customers, our HZ/3 software solution is a
cornerstone of this transactional data processing. _HZ/3 is an industry-specific software solution_
providing a broad variety of capabilities for our submetering and other digital services. HZ/3 covers the
billing of heating and ancillary costs for submetering. The system has been set up specifically for most
countries in which we are active to be able to comply with the varying regulations. It comprises a strong
data model around buildings and relevant building infrastructure as a key pillar for our metering
services.

Landlords and tenants access their consumption data through a growing number of online self-services.
We are keen to further drive this shift from traditional delivery channels, and hence invest in developing
web technologies to this end. For example, we deliver monthly consumption data to tenants through our
app.

We plan to further leverage analytical and generative AI to increase automation efficiency and customer
experience across our core and support value chains. We see the highest potential for AI in the
transformation of our customer management where cognitive, omnichannel contact center capabilities
can further improve our customer self-service experience. This may include advanced chat bots creating
responses to customer requests and guiding customers to knowledge and service offerings.

**_IT Organization_**

Our IT teams are organized along business domains, with IT experts interlocking with the respective
business departments as one team for best agility and cooperation. Additional IT core services teams
and the IT governance team provide the necessary standardization and robustness to the Group. Senior
IT managers supervise all information technology affairs. Over the last years we significantly grew our
IT personnel base.

To further strengthen our digital offering, we expanded our expertise as we successfully attracted whole
teams of data science and IT talents to join our organization. Our IT teams today have significant


-----

experience in custom software development as well as packed-software and system integration. They
are mainly located in Germany with strategic additions from local-shore, near-shore, and off-shore IT
suppliers. We believe we have positioned ourselves as an attractive employer for IT professionals based
on purpose, technology, environment, and culture.

In 2020, we established our digital strategy lab, Techem X, and in 2023 launched Data X. While Data
_X focuses on data science to utilize the data value pools, the goal of Techem X is to invent, design and_
develop adjacent digital products and services for the real estate sector, based on our domain expertise
within the real estate and energy sectors, our data sets and customer access. We aim to deliver further
technological advancements to enhance our services and products in the future. To achieve this, Techem
_X has a dedicated data science team, which is tightly interconnected with our IT team. Techem X is_
further supported by selective strategic suppliers. Furthermore, _Techem X promotes a new working_
environment with a focus on customer-centricity to further enhance our core capabilities and corporate
culture.

With the support of _Techem X, we have developed two digital products that improve customer_
experience on our digital channels. First, in February 2022 we launched our monthly consumption
information service _EED Verbrauchsinfo. This offering helps customers in implementing the_
requirements of the EU Energy Efficiency Directive which requires our customers and their tenants to
produce monthly consumption information. Second, we introduced our digital service Techem Billing
_Direct with the aim of revolutionizing our industry as it enables a seamless billing process that only_
takes a few minutes from when customers request a bill. As of September 30, 2023, approximately
40,000 buildings with approximately 200,000 tenant units corresponding to approximately 35% of our
private customers with online access have been processed with Techem Billing Direct.

_Information Security & Cyber Resilience_

We see information security and cyber resilience as essential and a differentiator in the marketplace.
We have invested into comprehensive cyber security measures and have partnered with leading security
service providers as we recognize the importance of IT robustness, information security and data
privacy for our business and our reputation. Over the past years, we have increased the size of our
dedicated cyber security team and strengthened our internal security policies, procedures, and
management systems to safeguard our IT infrastructure and to protect sensitive data which we collect
during operations. We have invested into technology-based defense solutions, such as firewalls,
encryption, AI-based log analytics, and malware and phishing detection. In addition to technologybased security hardening, we are continuously investing in mandatory trainings and tests to raise
awareness for security issues across the Group. We have multiple partners helping to safeguard our
critical systems, data, and operations, including HCL Technologies Germany GmbH (“HCLTech”),
Microsoft and IBM. We hold an ISO 27001 security certification for our business in Germany.

Our infrastructure operations have been outsourced to HCLTech with a data center in Gothenburg,
Sweden. This cooperation is key for a strong, secure, and economical IT infrastructure. The interplay
between cloud and data center also allows us to achieve an attractive balance between cost and
innovation leadership.

**_Research & Product Development_**

The constant improvement of existing and the development of new products and solutions are essential
to expand our market-leading position as a comprehensive energy services provider. To this end, our
R&D activities are the foundation of our technical innovations, and we view our R&D efforts as a key
driver to creating sustainable growth and long-term value for the Group. Our R&D expertise relies on
our extensive and expanding knowledge of energy saving methodology and low-power electronics.

Our R&D activities focus on the development of new products and solutions as well as on the
monitoring and improvement of existing products. Our device development teams concentrate on in

-----

house development of high-volume devices such as HCAs or devices that play a key role in our digital
infrastructure such as the smart reader device. However, we also develop some of our devices and
supplementary equipment together with third parties or in cooperation with OEMs who then produce
these devices exclusively for us according to our specifications. Besides, we also focus on the
continuous adjustment of our product range to adapt to market trends and developments, particularly in
the fields of digitalization and sustainability. In addition, our R&D team monitors and controls the
quality of our producers of high-volume devices, to ensure a high reliability and to minimize the defect
rate.

Our R&D efforts are driven by the three factors (i) evolving customer needs, (ii) general developments
in the markets in which we operate and (iii) regulatory changes. We have increased our development
speed in recent years, especially during the energy cost crisis as a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, and
as regulatory changes became more and more rapid.

We utilize a variety of opportunities offered by increased digitalization and AI to develop new
technologies with the aim to enable us to provide a superior customer experience. Our R&D efforts are
driven by colleagues from different departments, such as device development, digital IT, Techem X and
service delivery. These teams work jointly on R&D projects. We pursue an agile approach with iterative
development processes across the Group.

Our R&D activities follow a customer-centric focus, and we oftentimes benefit from customers who
turn to us with requests to specifically address challenges they face. Our R&D focus is furthermore
implemented by way of continuous customer feedback loops within our processes and involves
quantitative and qualitative research instruments as well as constant user testing across all phases, in
particular before we launch a product or service. In addition, we use co-development approaches to
develop and launch products and services together with lead customers. To this end, we provide
customers with the opportunity to actively impact our R&D process. We believe this approach of codevelopment is beneficial as it provides us with insights of the needs and processes of our customers
and demonstrates additional opportunities for our customers. We secure commercial commitments by
our customers at a relatively early stage enabling us to benefit from economies of scale in the future.

As an industry thought leader, we established a distinct unit for fundamental research and applied
research on energy efficiency and decarbonization in 2022, the Techem Research Institute on
Sustainability (“TRIOS”). We believe it is fundamental to not only invest into product and serviceoriented research, but also to foster the fundamental knowledge on energy efficiency and
decarbonization with a focus on the real estate sector. As part of this pledge, TRIOS annually publishes
our Techem Consumption and Carbon Figures Study, which conducts an analysis of energy and water
usage and carbon emission data of more than 1.5 million households in Germany. In addition to
advancing knowledge that will support our own products, these efforts aim to strengthen our credibility
and demonstrate our commitment to our mission and vision of making buildings green, smart and
healthy.

We have established multiple alliances and co-operations with industry participants, research institutes,
universities, and start-ups, among others, with the Dresden University of Technology, Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, National Metrology Institute of Germany, HLK Stuttgart GmbH, Fraunhofer
Institute for Integrated Circuits, Cetecom, Zeltwanger and the Ilmenau University of Technology. These
alliances and co-operations help us to further our understanding and exchange of knowledge while
further creating opportunities to conduct pilot studies, seek out investment opportunities and further
develop innovative technologies.

**Our Operating Model and Customer-Centric Approach**

**_Guiding principles for customer-centricity_**

As a result of our recent transformation, we believe to stand out as a customer-centric company as we
measure our own success strictly according to our customers’ satisfaction. We have therefore
established an operating model to constantly improve the fulfilment of our customers’ expectations.
This operating model is designed according to customer journeys and revolves around three guiding
principles:

- Transparency: We aim to ensure full transparency along the entire customer journey. Our
status-tracking of all customer inquiries, status reporting through our own service portal and
performance management platform allow for internal and external information on process
execution and support at any time.

- Performance: We have dedicated KPIs in place to measure our onboarding and delivery process
with a view to meet our customers’ expectations. Our focus lies on the timely fulfilment of
service through on-time delivery as well as quality of service by achieving a low correction
quota.

- Steering: We apply a comprehensive steering model that guides and controls our operations
with end-to-end focus. We have set up quality gates and structured handover procedures at all
key process and department interfaces to avoid disruptions that could negatively affect either
transparency or performance.

These three principles take full advantage of our digitalization approach which aims to achieve both an
optimal customer onboarding and service delivery. We therefore follow an advanced process for data
handling in customer onboarding which also is a prerequisite for correct and timely service delivery.
These services become even more reliable based on intra-year data on device infrastructure status and
consumption. The collection of this data is further supported by our cloud-based reading infrastructure.

**_Sales and Customer Onboarding_**

As part of our target operating model, we continuously adapt our sales approach to meet customer needs
and address attractive market opportunities.

In Germany, we have dedicated sales teams for each of the different customer groups: In the key account
management and large customer segments, we utilize individual personal customer support. These
customer groups are constantly analyzed through our account and opportunity management system. We
reach regional customers and private customers through different channels, such as the digital sales
channel, tele sales and our field sales team. We focus on a strong, complementary interconnection
between all sales channels in order to create the best experience for our customers. We have established
an advanced sales performance management process and we have shifted focus more and more to a
value-oriented approach when setting sales targets. This performance management is carried out
consistently across all sales employees and executives at regular intervals. To further improve the
effectiveness of our sales process, we implemented standardized processes. These are overseen and
controlled by the sales support team. A rigorous training approach for our sales force ensures that we
are able to quickly respond to market demands as well as new products and services. In addition to our
sales team, a specialized, cross-functional tender team focuses solely on efficient, timely responses to
tenders.

With every newly won contract, we are focused on providing a smooth installation process for our
customers. This is particularly important for the customer experience in times of material and resource
shortages on the market. Allocating the relevant devices and disposition of technicians is a challenging
process, as our supply chain management and installation processes require full transparency on the
status of queries by external partners involved in the installation process. We take an integrated view


-----

on this process as we designed data sets, processes, and quality gates alongside the customer journey
until the installation process is finalized and service readiness is ensured. To support this, we are
currently implementing an algorithm-driven sales inventory and operations planning process. Since
introduction of this process in early 2023, we managed to increase our installation time commitments.
To increase efficiency in our customer onboarding process, we have split field-operations into internal
customer service units for small or complex tasks, while external installation partners deal with larger
mass-installations.

We have further developed an organizational set-up focused on customer-specific needs. After a
successful customer acquisition, the aim of our customer onboarding is to ensure and reassure the
service delivery ability through a well-functioning (digital) infrastructure. Therefore, we have
structured the organization with an onboarding service, i.e., order and return management, as well as
with an invoicing and field service, i.e., disposition, installation execution and control. Furthermore, we
established an integrated production planning and control function. Further development of the
customer onboarding will be covered by end-to-end responsible teams for design and change
management.

With the 2021 launch of the fully digital sales channel of Techem Direct, private customers in particular
are able to order our services with a few steps in a way we believe addresses the specific needs and
expectations of private customers.

**_Service Delivery and Customer Service_**

Our service delivery operating model is geared towards fully cloud connected properties as these
properties allow us to permanently supervise our infrastructure through the use of our digital devices
and services. This enables us to deliver a superior experience for our customers and, simultaneously
requires reduced manpower for tasks including device reading, billing, customer service, maintenance
procedures and clarification of consumption data. Servicing cloud connected properties also allows us
to offer our fully digitalized billing processes. Each of these services allow for enhanced customer
experience that differentiates itself from the traditional offering in our market: data collection processes
that formerly took several weeks and involved numerous queries can now be completed without
interruptions. As a result, we have increased our delivery on time quota from approximately 71% the
financial year ended September 30, 2019, to approximately 84% as of June 2023 and over the same
period reduced the correction quota, i.e., the share of faulty billings produced by us which needed to be
corrected, from 5.8% to 3.4%. For fully automated digital processing, we increased our delivery on time
quota to 99% (as of August 2023).

We serve our customers under an operating model that is based on remote interactions through
telephone and our digital customer portal _my.techem, supported by a consolidated network of main_
offices and smaller service points. Our customer management is run by cross-functional teams of
adequate size to improve performance management and efficiency with respect to costs and quality.
Our team is supported by specialists focusing on urgent queries who work with our internal escalation
processes to appropriately prioritize queries in accordance with customer needs. This allows for a
reduced customer inquiry time through automated status tracking, thereby avoids lengthy
investigations. We have increased the speed of our customer inquiry solutions which we monitor
through our one-contact solution share tracking whether a customer receives a solution upon first
contact with our customer service team.

As part of our service delivery, we are consequently organized in service design teams responsible for
design and delivery of the respective services, i.e., ancillary energy efficiency solutions (MPO, DHC,
data exchange), as well as digital processing (i.e., smart service monitoring, regulatory requirements,
_Techem Billing Direct). In customer service, the shift form physical customer interaction towards_
remote and digital handling of the whole customer journey will be further supported by consolidated
hubs with selective physical presence, an integrated nearshore center for selected support functions in
Poland, as well as a modern digital customer service center/portal.


-----

**ENERGIZE-T**

All major strategic and operational transformative initiatives underpinning our management plan are
organized under the umbrella of our comprehensive group wide transformative value creation program
_ENERGIZE-T, which we initiated in 2018 and focuses on various targeted improvements to further_
enhance our operational and financial performance. _ENERGIZE-T aims to foster the digital_
transformation of the Company and business along four thrusts: quality and performance, digital
business platform, accelerated growth, and cultural transformation.

The key strategic initiatives along our value creation program ENERGIZE-T are:

- Operational excellence;

- Commercial excellence;

- Digitalization of our business;

- Energy efficiency in the heating value chain;

- Growth in new products and services;

- International strategy;

- M&A strategy;

- Financial profile;

- Environment, social and governance; and

- Leadership and cultural transformation.

_ENERGIZE-T projects are based on clearly pre-defined objectives and targeted key results and aim to_
achieve tangible outcomes, such as measurable internal or external effects and financial impacts.
Internal and external resources are allocated respectively. We closely monitor the progress of each
initiative through weekly meetings, regular steering committee meetings as well as content deep dives
based on the individual need of each project. _ENERGIZE-T is managed by our dedicated inhouse_
Transformation Office with direct reporting line to our CFO.

**Customers**

With approximately 13 million residential units served in the financial year ended September 30, 2023,
we believe to have a well-diversified customer base across the real estate sector. We have a base of
more than 425,000 customers overall with more than 300,000 customers within our Energy Services
Germany business, where no single customer generated more than approximately 2% of our revenue in
the financial year ended September 30, 2023 (largest 15 customers: approximately 7%). We benefit
from long-term and established customer relationships with some customer relationships lasting for
significantly more than 20 years, and we occasionally have customer relationships for more than
40 years.

The contractual framework of cost allocation services can be characterized as a triangular business-tobusiness-to-consumer relationship involving the cost allocation company (such as Techem), its
customer (landlords or property managers) and the end-user (tenants). The landlord or property manager
maintains a direct relationship with the cost allocation company and is responsible for contractual
payments to the cost allocation company. Based on the individualized consumption-based billing
provided by the cost allocation company, landlords or property managers can subsequently issue
invoices to their tenants. Such invoices may include costs related to the provision of cost allocation
which can be passed on to tenants.


-----

**_Customer Groups_**

We have organized our customers in groups. With regard to our Energy Services Germany business,
customers of submetering and cost allocation services are split as follows:

- Key accounts: This group comprises our top 15 customers, who contributed approximately 7%
of our Energy Services Germany revenues in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. We
provide for special coverage for these key accounts through specialized and dedicated teams.

- Corporate customers: These comprise customers who are residential buildings owners and
property managers with more than 50 dwellings. Corporate customers contributed to the
majority of our revenues in the financial year ended September 30, 2022. We have set up a
dedicated sales team with a particular focus on driving digitalization for these customers.

- Private customers: These customers comprise smaller, typically private landlords with less than
50 dwellings. Private customers contributed approximately a quarter of our revenues in the
financial year ended September 30, 2022. We target these customers through direct marketing
and digital sales efforts.

- Other customers: This customer group comprises, among others, customers in our water testing
and energy certification business.

**_Customer Satisfaction_**

We measure customer satisfaction using various tools and analyzing various metrics. In 2020, we
conducted our first large, strategic customer satisfaction study, which we have since repeated 2022 and
are planning to conduct every second year. In the 2022 study, we surveyed approximately 900 of our
customers and approximately 300 customers from competitors. In nearly all categories, we were able
to increase our NPS by double digits compared to the 2020 study. We use the findings of these surveys
to challenge our internal processes and aim at further increasing our NPS across all customer groups.

Another metric we use to measure customer satisfaction is the customer churn rate. The customer churn
rate measures the number of customers switching from our products and solutions to other providers or
self-billing (i.e., not using any provider, but metering and billing themselves). We calculate the churn
rate based on the number of cancellations of our devices that become effective within a financial year
compared to the number of active devices at the beginning of the relevant financial year. A low customer
churn rate implies high levels of customer satisfaction. We constantly monitor and seek to effectively
address the factors affecting our customer churn rate to increase customer satisfaction and ultimately
profitability.

We believe that our operating model has positively contributed to the improvement of our customer
churn rate, as our digitalization efforts positively affect the main drivers of customer satisfaction (such
as delivery on time and correction quota). As a result, we were able to significantly reduce our customer
churn rate from 3.7% for the financial year ended September 30, 2019 to approximately 2% for the
financial year ended September 30, 2023. One example of the impact of digitalization on customer
satisfaction is Techem Billing Direct, our real-time online billing service, which reduces the waiting
time for a full heating bill from several weeks to just several minutes. As of September 30, 2023, this
digital service has a Trustpilot service rating of 4.4 out of 5 stars.

**Mergers & Acquisitions**

To accelerate our growth in Energy Services, we selectively acquire small submetering businesses. Our
add-on M&A activities focus on Germany, but also extend to selective acquisitions in some of the
international countries in which we already operate. We intend to continue to pursue the acquisition of
these businesses to generate further accretive growth.


-----

Our M&A approach benefits from consolidation opportunities in the fragmented market. These
opportunities arise due to the increasing complexity of the submetering business supported by evolving
regulatory standards and driven by technological advancements. The companies we typically acquire
are still founder-led, and in many cases unable or unwilling to develop their businesses in a way that is
necessary to keep up with the increasing competition in the market, in particular with respect to meet
changing regulation and customer digitalization needs. In addition, many owners of companies we
acquire seek an exit to solve succession challenges.

We believe we are one of the most dedicated consolidators in our market. We follow a strict approach
defined by our evaluation criteria and a consistent due diligence process, yielding a repeatable
acquisition model. Our integration approach aims at ensuring high customer retention through an
ongoing independent market presence of the acquired businesses (for example by way of an unchanged
interface of this business towards its customers) while leveraging our expertise and providing our
structure for processes, IT, administration, and procurement.

**Digital Marketing and Communications**

As our customers are primarily landlords and property managers of multi-dwelling buildings, in most
of our markets we do not market our products and services to tenants with whom we typically do not
have contractual relationships. Our marketing and communications efforts are tailored to this approach.

We primarily attract larger customers through social advertising, e-mail campaigns or smaller digital
events like the Techem business talks series. We further created a sales and information platform for
larger customers on our website which serves as the consolidated touchpoint for all our target groups.
We have merged our 32 websites across the Group into one centralized platform techem.com with a
modern design and intuitive user guidance. Customers, investors, employees, suppliers, stakeholders,
and partners gain access to this platform providing a unified experience with targeted content. By
guiding potential customers to become actual customers, the _techem.com platform helps expanding_
digital business in our markets worldwide. Our marketing technology stack allows local and global
marketing teams to continuously improve our websites to enhance the customer experience and drive
sales.

With regard to smaller private customers, we rely on direct and digital marketing activities. In particular,
we are expanding digital commerce activities and marketing automation to market sales of our online
billing services, smoke detection and in future climate monitoring, as well as water testing solutions.
These methods enable us to analyze generated data and optimize our future marketing efforts to target
potential customers more efficiently.

The key marketing measures we utilize online are performance-based advertising, social media
marketing (such as through “Facebook” and “LinkedIn,” as well as newsletters) and search engine
optimization. Our activities are based on our own set of customer data as well as external market
research. In this context, we developed an advertising partnership with “Immoscout24” as a leading real
estate sales and rental platform in Germany. Furthermore, we increasingly aim at strengthening our
reputation, credibility and increasing awareness about our mission and portfolio by utilizing digital
media platforms such as podcasts.

Alongside digital channels, we also regularly publish brochures and other publications highlighting our
product portfolio, and we also present our offerings at trade shows and industry events.

We are a member of trade associations on national and international levels. In Germany, this includes
memberships in Bundesverband Informationswirtschaft, Telekommunikation und neue Medien
(Bitkom), Bundesverband Neue Energiewirtschaft (bne), Deutsche Unternehmensinitiative
Energieeffizienz (DENEFF), Verband für Energiedienstleistungen, Effizienz und Contracting –
Association for Energy Services, Efficiency and Contracting (vedec), Bundesverband für Energie- und
Wasserdatenmanagement e.V., The Association for Energy Cost Allocation (E.V.V.E.), GdW

Ausschuss – German Property Federation (ZIA).

**Sustainability – General**

To create sustainable value in achieving our mission of climate neutrality in buildings, we have
integrated ESG aspects in our business strategy. Our position of being a digitally driven energy services
provider allows us to bundle our expertise from the submetering, ancillary services and contracting
business with a view to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and contribute to the energy transition. Our
sustainability strategy focusses on the three areas “For the Climate & the Environment,” “For the
_Individual & the Community,” and “For Ethical Business Conduct,”_

As a result of our sustainability commitment, in April 2023 we have achieved an ESG score of 8.7 by
Sustainalytics, rating our ESG risks as in the lowest risk category “negligible.” This rating ranks us
within the best two percent of all ratings Sustainalytics has currently issued for business support services
companies.

On February 3, 2023 we engaged Sustainalytics to perform a broad-based Corporate ESG Assessment
of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, covering eight ESG categories, including Occupational
Health & Safety, Human Capital, Carbon – Own Operations, Data Privacy & Security, Corporate
Governance, Product Governance, Emissions, Effluents and Waste and Bribery and Corruption.
Sustainalytics assessed us as having an overall indicative Corporate ESG Assessment score of 8.7,
which places Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH in the “Negligible Risk” category as of April
13, 2023. Our indicative score would place us in both the[ t]op 2nd percentile of Business Support
Services companies assessed by Sustainalytics and in the[ t]op 2nd percentile of all companies assessed
by Sustainalytics. This Corporate ESG Assessment is current as of April 13, 2023 and no information
made available after this date has been reflected in this assessment. This information is provided for

We have developed seven specific fields of action for these areas, each with defined KPIs and
improvement targets. We are committed to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals
(“SDGs”) and have further identified and follow six goals with ten sub-targets along these SDGs. To
further formalize our sustainability strategy, we have implemented policies for our sustainability
management. These policies aim to implement our sustainability strategy and related targets and KPIs
as they address individual aspects for all three identified priority areas of sustainability activities.

Our sustainability strategy is further supported by TRIOS, our own think tank for sustainability research
on energy efficiency and decarbonization. As part of our sustainability management, TRIOS calculates


-----

our carbon footprint, defines our own decarbonization roadmap and organizes our own energy audits
and certifications according to ISO 50001.

**_Sustainability – Focus Areas_**

_For the Climate & the Environment_

This area focuses on our most material activities and operations, and it comprises two fields of action:
climate neutral operations within the Group and climate-friendly buildings. The targets for the first field
of action area are centered around promoting environmentally responsible behavior within our own
business. This includes a focus on ecological device design and circularity as well as ensuring
sustainable lifecycles for our devices and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. To achieve this, we have
set a goal for the Group to reduce Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions by 37% by 2030, and reduce
it by 90% by 2045 (each compared to 2020). The second field of action, climate-friendly buildings,
refers to further strengthening a purposeful business model that offers green contracting solutions,
promotes energy efficiency in buildings based on digitalization, and establishes climate friendly
mobility (for example through EV Charging stations) to help landlords decarbonizing their real estate
assets.

In our contracting business, we are introducing renewable energy sources, digital solutions, and energy
efficient operations. We furthermore have a decarbonization roadmap in place which serves as the basis
for our active contribution to the energy transition: we mainly focus on using CO2-emission-neutral
heating solutions when equipping new construction projects and gradually replace existing fossil
heating systems through lower-emission technologies. Today, we offer all our customers a renewable
energy supply solution helping them to achieve the target set for Germany of a mandatory usage of a
minimum of 65% renewable energy for newly installed heating systems such as solar thermal heating
and heat pumps, on average.

In addition, we evaluate potential climate change-related impacts on our business. As recommended by
the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have assessed hypothetical
scenarios and potential consequences for the Techem Group. We also report on these risks and
opportunities related to climate change in our sustainability reporting. For example, for the so-called
“2-degree scenario,” which corresponds to the current climate neutrality commitments of the EU and
Germany, we have identified impairment risks due to a potential displacement of fossil gas and oil
heating in Germany, as well as opportunities in the field of green energy contracting as well as an
increasing demand for products and services related to a reduction of individual ecological footprints.
These scenario analyses further support our strategy of focusing on improving energy efficiency and
green contracting solutions.

_For the Individual & the Community_

Our initiatives in this area aim at adding value for employees, customers, and society. This focus area
addresses fields of action around creating and maintaining attractive working conditions worldwide and
a diverse workforce, health and satisfaction of customers and tenants, as well as innovation,
cooperation, and social commitment.

Our employees are the backbone of our operations. Hence, as a first field of action, we aim to create a
working environment where individual needs are met, and diversity, equity and inclusion is valued. We
are led by our guiding principles for fair working conditions (such as a bias-free recruiting process and
equal opportunities for development and career advancement), awareness and inclusion (for example
by promoting a strong level of diversity, equality and inclusion among our workforce), and actions
against discrimination imposing clear consequences for any discriminating behavior. To foster diversity
in our management, our goal is to achieve a share of 35% of women in our management positions (i.e.,
upper management, divisional management, department managers and team leaders) by the end of
financial year 2025. As of September 30, 2023, our share of women in management positions was 30%.
In this context we pursue a short-term goal of filling at least 40% of new appointments at management


-----

levels with female managers. We also have an ambition to maintain a safe and healthy working
environment as we target a very low rate of working and commuting accidents. We aim at providing
our employees with the best possible training by providing various learning opportunities and are
expanding our offering to employees in this regard. To this end, we are expanding our improvement
tracking of training quality, e.g., by using a learning NPS.

Healthy and satisfied customers and tenants are key for our business success. We therefore survey our
customers’ satisfaction regularly and take measures to improve it (for example through customer
surveys). To improve their individual housing quality, we also aim to ensure that our customers and
tenants benefit from fast, unbureaucratic service and solutions. We also focus on the needs of tenants.
For example, we interact with tenants as we investigate their satisfaction with the coordination of
appointments, meter reading and billing, and actively involve them and ask for suggestions for
improvement.

Lastly, as our goal is to make our customers’ buildings green, smart and healthy, we believe that our
fundamental R&D in the field of energy efficiency, decarbonization, intelligent and climate-neutral
living adds a contribution to society. We conduct research together with partners, and to this end we
collaborated with TU Dresden and TU Karlsruhe on different projects. We also aim at raising tenants’
awareness of consumption driven by our usage-based heating and water cost billing services, and as we
provide them with suggestions regarding the use of heat and hot water.

_For Ethical Business Conduct_

We focus on attaining a modern, value-based corporate culture and responsible corporate governance
geared to long-term value creation. This priority area comprises two fields of action: Ethical corporate
governance and compliance as well as a sustainable supply chain.

As part of the ethical corporate governance field of action, we promote and practice a value-oriented
corporate culture that reflects customer focus, team culture, personal growth, courage, networking,
leadership, innovation and commitment. We have embedded our cultural elements in our guidelines for
leadership and cooperation, as well as in our competence model.

Furthermore, we focus on fair competition, transparent pricing and ethical behavior that complies with
the law and avoids corruption. Our corporate governance set-up ensures that business is conducted in
accordance with regulations and integrity throughout the Group. For example, we focus on a high level
of data protection and privacy, conduct compliance surveys, and introduced an ISO 27001 certified
system for information security for critical systems in Germany. We also train our employees on ethical
targets and measures every year, and approximately 99% of our employees received training on
applicable compliance requirements in the financial year ended September 30, 2023. We also recognize
that acting with integrity is of key importance to us. We have developed a code of conduct group-wide
which demonstrates our commitment to convey our understanding of values throughout our
organization. We supplement this code by guidelines and training courses.

We also focus on a sustainable and resilient supply chain. We consider environmental and social criteria
when selecting our suppliers and require them to comply with our code of conduct applicable to
suppliers. To ensure compliance with the Supply Chain Act we are actively monitoring both our supply
chain and management regarding human rights and environmental issues.

We also follow a responsible remuneration policy, with all level 1 and 2 executives having a variable
salary component, linked to individual, company and ESG targets.

**_Sustainability – Key Goals and KPIs_**

To track our sustainability performance, we have defined certain KPIs based on a double materiality
assessment and aligned with our sustainability strategy as well as core values. This approach allows us
to make our commitment transparent across all business units. Further, our activities contribute to the


-----

SDGs. Overall, we have defined and track more than 70 KPIs, 66 of which are externally audited based
on global reporting initiative (GRI) standards with limited assurance. Furthermore, using our
sustainability dashboard we continuously track the steering of our most relevant sustainability KPIs on
a quarterly basis to analyze developments regularly and, if necessary, correct negative trends early on.

Since our first sustainability report published in 2020, we have been able to achieve key sustainability
goals. These include, among others, developing a roadmap to significantly reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3
emissions by 2045, and we have also set ourselves the target to achieve 35% women in management
positions by the end of the financial year 2025, conducting lifecycle assessments for selected devices
and switching to green electricity for our own use at all our sites in Germany by the financial year ended
September 30, 2022. In addition, we have switched to using 100% recycled paper and we further aim
to reduce our paper consumption by 50% by the end of the financial year 2024 compared to the financial
year ended September 30, 2020.

Sustainability is an integral part of all our activities in the Group. To continuously improve our
sustainability performance, we monitor our success in achieving our sustainability targets, engage with
our stakeholders, and involve our employees. We focus our attention on the key targets where we can
exert considerable influence.

**Employees and Human Resources**

Our human resources (“HR”) strategy is strongly aligned with our business strategy. By building a skillbased organization with effective and structured talent and performance management, we empower our
employees to support future business models aligned to our vision.

Furthermore, we leverage technology and innovation as enablers to generate value through advanced
analytics. This is supported by the implementation of Workday as our global HR tool which improves
data quality and thereby management of our workforce. We aim at successfully competing in the labor
market by using various channels to address and attract a skilled workforce in a target group-oriented
approach which we systematically track within Workday.

Our efforts to focus on mental health and well-being at work as well as the creation of a sustainable and
strong culture that is, among others, characterized by the dedication to our values and focusing on
diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our commitments to this end are reflected by our improved employee
NPS of 24 as of May 2023, representing a further improvement from the score of 13 we in May 2022,
as well an employee fluctuation in the low double-digit percentages for the financial year ended
September 30, 2022.

As we continuously pursue and support our transformation, we further strengthen our successfully
implemented Techem Academy as our holistic learning platform with comprehensive training offers.
The majority of our trainings are digital. Each of our employees attends on average more than 30 hours
of training annually, and more than 35,000 voluntary training courses are available to this end.

Our employee relations and those with worker councils are generally positive, and we have not
experienced any material labor-related work stoppages in recent years.

There has been no material change in the employee headcount of the Group between December 31,
2023 and the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**Intellectual Property**

Historically, we have patented several market innovations, including both products and processes. As
of September 30, 2023, we held 81 national patents, mainly in Europe, with 23 additional patent
applications pending in 51 patent families.

Patented key inventions are used in our metering devices with radio transmission, in the water meter
radio module (e.g., leakage detection, manipulation detection, rotation detection), for manipulation
protection (seal of HCA and securing local communication interface with authentication codes), and in
systems and processes for reducing the energy consumption in buildings. Further patented technology
may be used in remote reading systems (data collector network and mobile data transmission,
optimization of transmission of large data volumes). Pending applications are mainly linked to the
developments around the MSD and DHC. We currently hold more than 70 trademarks in Germany, the
EU, and some non-EU countries. The most relevant trademarks are our company name Techem, bautec
and Techem Smart System. In addition, our Group owns approximately 200 internet domain names. The
most important of these domains are www.techem.com and www.techem.de.

Although our patents, utility models and trademarks as a whole are materially significant for our
business, we believe that no single intellectual property right and no individual group of intellectual
property rights are materially important to our business as a whole. We also rely on trade secrets, nonpatented knowledge, innovative product updates and ongoing technological advances to maintain our
competitiveness. We aim to protect our position by entering into non-disclosure and similar agreements.

In addition to our own patents, we have licensed third-party patents, and most of them were or are used
in our systems and modules.

As of December 31, 2023, we were not subject to any material claim or legal action alleging
infringement of third-party owned intellectual property.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

In March 2021, Techem Energy Services GmbH, as tenant, and Eschborn Hauptstrasse S.à r.l. as
landlord, entered into a leasing agreement (the “Leasing Agreement”) with respect to our headquarter
at Hauptstraße 89–91, 65760 Eschborn, Germany, with approximately 15,804.94 square meters of
office space plus ancillary space. The Leasing Agreement has a fixed term that ends on February 29,
2036, with the option to prolong the fixed term two times, in each case, by five years. In 2024, we are
reducing the rented office space in this property by approximately 25% (3,940 square meters).


-----

**Legal Proceedings**

During the ordinary course of our business activities, we are regularly involved in legal proceedings.
These proceedings include routine civil, labor, and other matters.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we are not involved, and have not been involved during
the past 12 months, in any governmental, legal or arbitration proceedings (including any such
proceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware) which may have or have had in
the recent past significant effects on our financial position or profitability.

**Insurance**

We hold several international insurance policies partly centrally managed by our procurement
department and adjusted on an ongoing basis according to current circumstances. We obtain our thirdparty liability insurance based on benchmark analyses in the form of a master policy and underlying
local insurance policies to cover particular risks in some of the countries in which we operate. Groupwide and local insurance policies are subject to customary exclusions, limits, and deductibles. Our
insurance coverage includes general liability and product liability insurance, environmental impairment
liability insurance, commercial legal aid insurance, property damage insurance covering buildings,
facilities and machinery, insurance for business interruptions resulting from fire, covering loss of
profits, standing charges and claims surveyor-fees, and travel insurance.

Through our arrangements, the Group has insurance coverage in place in relation to a number of risks
associated with its business activities, as well as a directors and officers liability (“D&O”) insurance
policy. The D&O insurance protects the directors from claims for damages by the Company. Such D&O
insurance has a total coverage of up to €50 million per claim and for all claims per year.

We believe that our insurance coverage, including the maximum coverage amounts and terms and
conditions of the insurance policies, are both standard for our industry and appropriate. We cannot,
however, guarantee that we will not incur any losses or be the subject of claims that exceed the scope
of the relevant insurance coverage.

**REGULATION**

**Overview**

Our two business segments, Energy Services and Energy Efficiency Solutions, are influenced by a wide
range of regulatory requirements under European Union and national law dealing with the energy and
water supply to buildings, in particular metering and billing. While, at least with regard to the Energy
Services business segment, most of these requirements apply to our customers, our products and
services need to comply with applicable rules in order to be suitable to our customers’ needs. The
following contains an overview of the key EU and German legislation that impacts our business.

The legal frameworks in the 18 countries in which we operate vary substantially and may differ from
the key EU and German legislation described below.

**Energy Services**

Our Energy Services business segment offers submetering and cost allocation services, ancillary energy
efficiency solutions and supplementary products and services to our customers, who are typically
landlords, condominium owners’ associations (Wohnungseigentümergemeinschaften) and property
managers. In order to be able to provide such services, we rent or sell devices to our customers, offer
the maintenance services required for such devices, read the submeters, aggregate the consumption data
and allocate costs based on the collected consumption data to each individual end-user. See “Business–
_–Our Business Activities––Energy Services.” In Germany, we also offer radio-enabled smoke detectors,_
and related services, including installation, testing, maintenance, and replacement. We also offer
legionella analysis of drinking water in Germany as well as the supply with water softening and dosing
systems and the rendering of services connected with the protection against calcification or corrosion
of the drinking water pipes in buildings (Techem Water Technology). In Germany, we are further
operating electricity metering points since the end of 2020 which includes, inter alia, the installation,
operation and maintenance of the metering devices.

The primary purposes of the legislation influencing cost allocation is to create an incentive for energy
and water conservation through consumption-based metering and billing as well as ensuring a fair and
transparent allocation of costs. For Techem, the laws and provisions mainly of interest are those that
impose obligations on owners of buildings and residential units that favor growth in the market for cost
allocation and billing services. This is the case especially with regard to the obligation to provide for
consumption-based metering and billing of heating and water, the obligation to install and maintain
submetering and data collection equipment that meets statutory requirements, and the rules allowing
our customers to allocate the costs of submetering to their tenants.

**_Consumption-Based Metering and Billing of Heating and Water Consumption_**

_Heating and Hot Water Consumption_

Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency which took effect on December 4, 2012, is part of the EU
energy efficiency framework and requires all EU countries to increase energy usage efficiency at all
stages of the energy chain, from production to final consumption, with the further aim to reduce
dependency on energy imports from outside the EU and to achieve a “European Energy Union.” The
Directive was first recast 2018 and required Member States to take measures for the promotion of
energy efficiency in order to ensure the achievement of the EU-wide energy savings target of 20% in
2020 and at least 32.5 % by 2030. The Directive was revised and recast in 2023 (Directive (EU)
2023/1791) making it binding for Member States to collectively ensure an additional 11.7% reduction
of energy consumption by 2030, compared to the 2020 projections. The revised Directive entered into
force on 10 October 2023 with a general transposition deadline ending October 11, 2025.

Directive 2012/27/EU replaced Directive 2006/32/EC, which already established an energy savings
target of 9% by 2016. The achievement of this target can and should be promoted by a range of


-----

measures, including consumption based measuring and informative billing of energy consumption.
Directive 2012/27/EU, also in its current recasted form as Directive (EU) 2023/1791, reinforces that
Member States must ensure, to the extent technically feasible and cost-efficient, that individual
consumption meters to measure the consumption of heat or cooling or hot water for each unit are
installed in multi-unit residential or commercial buildings either with a central heating or cooling source
or which are supplied from a district heating or district cooling network or from a central source serving
multiple buildings. Since October 25, 2020, newly installed submetering and cost allocation devices for
heating, cooling and domestic hot water are required to be readable remotely to ensure cost-effective,
frequent provision of consumption information. Member States are free to decide whether walk-by or
drive-by technologies are to be considered remotely readable or not. Remotely readable devices do not
require access to individual apartments or units to be read. Further, the directives require accurate billing
based on actual consumption. Final energy customers must receive detailed energy bills and information
including consumption data free of charge to further ensure appropriate information of the end customer
and trigger behavioral change. The directives furthermore provide that costs for third parties tasked with
the metering, allocation and accounting for actual individual consumption in such buildings may be
passed on to the final customers to the extent that such costs are reasonable.

In Germany, parts of the requirements of Directive 2012/27/EU and Directive (EU) 2023/1791 have
been and will be implemented by the Heating Cost Ordinance (Heizkostenverordnung) which has been
in force since 1981 and has been amended from time to time since then. Pursuant to the Heating Cost
Ordinance, the owner of a multi-unit residential or commercial building with a central heating or hot
water system or commercially supplied with heat and/or hot water is required to measure the individual
consumption of heating and hot water of the individual end-users, and to bill the costs at least in part
based on the individual consumption of the end-users. The Heating Cost Ordinance overrides all
contractual agreements (except for buildings with only two apartments of which one is used by the
landlord himself), meaning that the parties to a commercial or residential rent agreement cannot
stipulate that the heating and hot water costs will be paid for by, for example, a lump-sum payment by
the individual user. The Heating Cost Ordinance also applies to condominium units
(Wohnungseigentum), requiring the consumption of heating and hot water of each condominium unit to
be accounted on the basis of individual consumption.

The Heating Cost Ordinance provides for various exceptions from the obligation to provide
consumption-based metering of heating and hot water. In particular, premises in which consumptionbased metering of heating and hot water could only be achieved through an unreasonably large
expenditure are exempted. Further exceptions apply to older buildings where individual heat
consumption cannot be regulated or to, for example, nursing homes and student dorms.

A further exception exists in the case of buildings that are mostly supplied with heating or hot water
from heating recovery systems or solar heating systems. Until recently, this exception also applied to
buildings that are mostly supplied with heating or hot water from heating pumps. However, this
exception has been removed by an amendment to the Heating Cost Ordinance in the context of an
amendment to the German Buildings Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz) in October 2023. For
buildings with heating pumps submetering will become mandatory and submetering devices have to be
installed by September 30, 2025, at the latest.

Exceptions also apply for buildings supplied with heat or hot water from cogeneration systems or
facilities that utilize waste heat if data on the heating consumption of the building is not collected.
However, sec. 18 of the Ordinance on the General Conditions for the Supply of District Heating (AVB
_FernwärmeVerordnung) in connection with sec. 3 of the Ordinance on the metering and billing of_
district heating or district cooling (Verordnung über die Verbrauchserfassung und Abrechnung bei der
_Versorgung mit Fernwärme oder Fernkälte - FFVAV) require metering of individual consumption_
anyways. Therefore, existing exceptions are limited.

The 2018 amendment of Directive 2012/27/EU which is also reflected in the Directive (EU) 2023/1791
provided for a shift towards more advanced metering and billing solutions and phasing out of old


-----

metering devices in favor of remotely readable devices. Germany has implemented the respective
requirements by amending the Heating Cost Ordinance in 2021. In this context, installed metering and
cost allocation devices for heating, cooling and domestic hot water, if not readable remotely, will have
to be upgraded or replaced with remotely readable devices until December 31, 2026. Furthermore, since
January 1, 2022, end-users must be provided with monthly billing or individual consumption
information if remotely readable metering devices have already been installed. Bills further have to
entail various information such as comparisons of the final user’s current energy consumption with
consumption for the same period in the previous year and comparisons of the end-user’s consumption
with an average end-user’s consumption.

The 2021 amendment of the Heating Cost Ordinance further introduced new requirements regarding
remote readability, Smart Meter Gateway (“SMGW”) – connectivity and interoperability of metering
devices. Since December 1, 2022, newly installed metering devices for heat and hot water have to be
able to be connected to an SMGW and be interoperable. An SMGW is the central communication unit
of a smart metering system which enables communication between the gateway and one or more locally
installed gateway-connected metering devices and the collecting, processing and transmitting of data.
Interoperability means that metering devices are required to collect and transmit consumption data
under an industry-wide, open, vendor independent technical communication standard. This allows
metering companies to read out (and make sense of) the consumption data of any metering device,
irrespective of their original manufacturer or current owner. Remotely readable metering devices
installed by December 1, 2022, which are not yet interoperable and cannot be connected to an SMGW
may however continue to remain in service until December 31, 2031.

Even though we do not expect that the Heating Cost Ordinance will change to our detriment in the
future, there is no guarantee that this ordinance, or any other future legislation, will maintain the current
requirements with respect to the submetering of heating and hot water consumption or that the number
of exceptions to these requirements will not increase. Any changes to the Heating Cost Ordinance, or
any other future legislation that would eliminate or reduce submetering requirements or increase the
number of exceptions to these requirements, could have a negative impact on our business. See “Risk
_Factors––Risks Related to Our Business––Our cost allocation business is influenced by regulation_
_aimed at, among other things, promoting the efficient use of energy and water. Amendments to these_
_regulations could have a negative impact on our business activities and significantly impair our_
_prospects.”_

_Cold Water Consumption_

The building codes (Landesbauordnungen) of most German federal states also provide for an obligation
to install cold water submetering devices in residential units, at least with respect to new buildings.

**_Calibration Rules_**

The MID establishes the requirements that certain metering devices and systems, in particular water
and heat meters as specified in the annexes to the MID, have to meet in order to be placed on the market
or put into use, if the use is prescribed by a Member State for reasons of public interest, public health,
public safety, public order, the protection of the environment, the protection of consumers, the levying
of taxes and duties, and fair trading. The MID requires Member States to ensure that metering
instruments are only placed on the market or put into use if they satisfy the MID requirements,
particularly after their conformity with the requirements of the MID has been assessed in accordance
with the procedural requirements stipulated in the MID. Germany implemented the MID into national
law by the German Measures and Weights Act (Mess- und Eichgesetz) and the German Measures and
Weights Ordinance (Mess- und Eichverordnung).

Pursuant to the Heating Cost Ordinance and most German state building codes, individual units must
be furnished with equipment that allows for consumption-based metering and billing of heating and
water consumption. In practical terms, this requires the installation of heat and water meters or heat cost


-----

allocators. In Germany, if used for commercial purposes, heat and water meters are generally subject to
the German Measures and Weights Act as well as the German Measures and Weights Ordinance and
have to be calibrated (geeicht) by the competent authority or to undergo a conformity assessment
procedure. According to the German Measures and Weights Act, users of heat and water meters as well
as relevant service providers have to notify the use of new or refurbished meters to the competent
authority within six weeks.

The validity of a heat and water meter’s calibration is limited to a certain period of time. Upon the
expiration of such calibration period, the relevant metering instrument has to be replaced, if the period
has not been extended after a recalibration. The calibration period for heat and warm water meters as
well as for cold water meters is currently six years. Generally, for practical and cost reasons, the devices
are replaced at the expiration of the calibration period instead of being recalibrated.

The heat and water meters rented or sold by us need to comply with the specifications of the MID as
implemented into national laws as well as any other applicable national laws on weights and measures.
Moreover, we offer our customers a timely replacement of the relevant metering instruments, thereby
assisting our customers in maintaining compliance with applicable statutory provisions. See “Business–
_–Devices––Heating Consumption” and “Business––Devices––Water Consumption.”_

**_Rules on the Allocation of Costs Related to Submetering_**

In Germany the rules on the allocation of costs govern whether and to what extent our customers are
entitled to pass on the costs for energy and water consumption as well as for devices and services to
end-users. A landlord’s ability to allocate the costs of our devices and services to tenants is largely
determined by German tenancy law, which, in general, distinguishes between residential and
commercial rental agreements, the former being under more prescriptive regulations.

_Renting of Submetering and Data Collection Devices_

Under applicable German law, most of the costs related to submetering can be passed on to end-users.
This particularly applies to the costs of renting devices required for the collection of consumption data,
including maintenance costs as described below. Generally, the landlord is free to choose between
purchasing or renting devices and is not required to select the cheaper of the two options, as long as the
option chosen is not exorbitantly more expensive than the other one. Before renting metering devices
for the first time for a property or–according to some scholars–if existing submetering devices are
replaced and this leads to a significant cost increase or completely new devices are installed, the landlord
has to inform the tenants about his intentions and associated costs. If a majority of tenants objects within
a month, the passing-on of rental costs to tenants is not possible. In this case, landlords may still choose
to purchase submetering devices (and pass on associated costs, see above) or decide to rent them without
passing on the renting costs to the tenants.

However, costs passed on to tenants have to be “reasonable.” Tenants may seek judicial review of costs
they find “unreasonable,” and courts may reduce costs to the level they consider to be reasonable. There
is no determined threshold as for when costs become unreasonable. Individual courts have, for example,
considered metering and billing costs unreasonable which amounted to 15% of the total operating costs
in 5 consecutive years or which regularly exceeded 15% of the fuel costs. Generally, this is decided on
a case-by-case basis under consideration of available alternatives, e.g., prices charged by competitors.
Published case law indicates that courts grant landlords a certain amount of discretion in selecting a
service provider, i.e., landlords are not required to always go with the cheapest alternative. Rather, other
considerations (such as reliability) can justify elevated costs.

_Purchase of Submetering and Data Collection Devices_

If the landlord of a residential unit purchases submetering and data collection devices for heating or
water and initially installs them in a residential unit, the landlord, under the BGB, can usually increase
the annual rent payable by tenants of the residential unit by up to 8% of the costs incurred for the


-----

purchase of the submetering and data collection devices, but within the following six years the monthly
rent may only be increased by two or three euro per square meter, depending on the monthly rent per
square meter of the living area before the rent increase. This standard applies to the first installation of
the devices. However, a later change of the devices must be objectively required and therefore
necessary. The BGB prohibits any subsequent increase that would, in consideration of expected future
operating costs, constitute an exceptional hardness for the tenant. However, based on our experience
landlords almost always rent devices in Germany.

In commercial units, the landlord has to reach an individual agreement with the tenant in order to pass
on the costs of installation, unless the rental agreement already provides for submeters to be installed.

_Maintenance Costs for Submetering and Data Collection Devices_

Irrespective of whether a landlord purchases or rents submetering and data collection devices for heating
and water, maintenance costs for such devices are generally contractually allocable as operating costs,
for example, with respect to heating and hot water pursuant to the Heating Cost Ordinance, and with
respect to cold water pursuant to the Ordinance on Operating Costs (Verordnung über die Aufstellung
_von Betriebskosten)._

Even though we do not expect that the ability to allocate costs will change to the landlord’s—and thus
our—detriment, there is no guarantee that the current or future statutory provisions enabling such
allocation of costs will remain in place. Any changes to the statutory provisions or court decisions
affecting the allocation of costs could have a negative impact on our business. See “Risk Factors––
_Risks related to Our Business––Our cost allocation business is influenced by regulation aimed at,_
_among other things, promoting the efficient use of energy and water. Amendments to these regulations_
_could have a negative impact on our business activities and significantly impair our prospects.”_

**_Billing of Operating Costs_**

With respect to our billing services relating to operating costs, (see “Business––Our Business Activities–
_–Energy Services”), our customers—and therefore we—must comply with the applicable tenancy law_
provisions governing the billing of operating costs to tenants. These operating costs include the costs
of heating and hot water. If not agreed otherwise between the parties and to the extent it is legally
admissible, operating costs for residential premises are usually to be allocated in proportion to floor
space. Operating costs depending on individually recorded or metered consumption or causation by
tenants are to be allocated according to criteria that take into account differing consumption or
causation. The Heating Cost Ordinance requires landlords and owners of buildings to generally
distribute and bill 50-70% of the costs of heating and hot water based on the individual consumption of
the end-user. Under German law, the landlord is regularly required to provide consumption-based
billing of cold water if cold water submeters have been installed for all tenants of a building.

If a contract for the rent of a residential unit stipulates advance payments for operating costs, these
advance payments are to be invoiced once a year and offset against the operating costs incurred. The
overall operating costs account must be presented to the tenant of a residential unit within twelve months
after the end of the accounting period. After twelve months, any additional claims by the landlord
against the tenant of a residential unit regarding operating costs are excluded unless the landlord is not
responsible for the delay. The costs account generally must indicate the accounting period, the total
expenditure for operating costs, information about the distribution key, the calculation of the costs
referring to the individual tenant, the deduction of the advance payments made by the tenant and the
(debit or credit) result. The tenant has to raise any objections within twelve months after receipt of the
operating costs account.

**_Data Protection_**

By providing submeter reading and billing services, as well as our energy monitoring services, in
relation to heating and water consumption to our customers, we act as data processors within the


-----

meaning of Section 62 of the (new) German Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz) and the
GDPR, meaning that we process personal data on behalf of the data controller, our customer. As such,
we need to comply with legal data protection requirements, the instructions of the data controller and
in particular implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to secure personal
data. The GDPR, which came into force on May 25, 2018, imposes stringent operational requirements
on both data controllers and data processors, and introduces significant penalties for non-compliance
with fines of up to 4% of total annual worldwide turnover or € 20 million (whichever is higher),
depending on the type and severity of the breach.

**_Access and Transfer of Data_**

Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 of the European Parliament and of the Council on harmonized rules on fair
access to and use of data (“Data Act”) entered into force on January 11, 2024, and shall apply from
September 12, 2025. The Data Act sets out rules, on technical requirements for connected products and
making available of data generated by connected products to its users. A connected product is an item
that obtains, generates or collects data concerning its use or environment and that is able to communicate
product data via an electronic communications service, physical connection or on-device access, and
whose primary function is not the storing, processing or transmission of data on behalf of any party
other than the user. It is likely that remotely readable meter and Smart Meters will qualify as connected
devices. We will therefore have to comply with the requirement set out in the Data Act from September
12, 2025.

In particular, the Data Act sets out technical requirements and corresponding user rights. For example,
the Data Act requires that connected products are designed and manufactured in such a manner that
“product data” and “related service data” are easily and directly accessible to users of the product free
of charge. Where data cannot be directly accessed by the users, data holders have to make the data
available to users free of charge. Furthermore, upon request by a user, readily available data would also
need to be made available to third parties. This shall be done free of charge for the user. However, if
the third party and data recipient is a business, compensation for making available the data may be
charged from the third party. This compensation may include a margin but must be non-discriminatory
and reasonable. The European Commission is currently working on a guideline that will specify what
is meant by “reasonable margin.”

**_Smoke Detectors_**

With respect to our business in the smoke detector sector (see “Business––Our Business Activities––
_Energy Services”), there is no uniform legal environment. Building law in Germany is partly regulated_
by the German federal states (Länder). This applies particularly to safety-related issues. All federal
states in Germany have now made the installation and maintenance of smoke detectors mandatory in
residential buildings. The obligation generally applies not only to new buildings but also to existing
buildings.

Under German law, a landlord may regularly pass on the costs incurred for the initial purchase of smoke
detectors in a residential building to the tenant as modernization costs by increasing the annual rent
payable by tenants of the residential unit by up to 8% of the costs incurred for the purchase. Costs for
the maintenance of smoke detectors may be allocated to the tenant of a residential unit as operating
costs. However, according to a recent decision by the Federal Court of Justice in 2023 the renewal of
smoke detectors may not be passed on as modernization costs to tenants, unless there is a technical
improvement, or the renewal otherwise increases the value of the property. The Federal Court of Justice
has further ruled in 2022 that the costs of renting smoke detectors may not be passed on to the tenant.
This is however not applicable to condominium owners’ associations as long as none of the units are
rented out to a tenant.


-----

**_Legionella Analysis_**

The aim of the German Drinking Water Ordinance (Trinkwasserverordnung) is to protect human health
from the possibility of drinking water contamination. Since legionella particularly constitute a health
risk in misting and aerosols, the Drinking Water Ordinance provides for an obligatory legionella
analysis of drinking water to be conducted by owners and operators of hot water facilities of a certain
size that are connected with showers or other installations which result in a nebulization of drinking
water, if drinking water is provided in the course of a public or commercial practice. The regulations
therefore apply to owners or landlords and administrators of many multi-unit residential buildings with
central heating systems.

According to the German Drinking Water Ordinance and the applicable DIN EN ISO 19458, drinking
water generally has to be tested and analyzed every three years or in some cases once a year by a
laboratory that is both accredited by and listed with the competent state authority. See “Business––Our
_Business Activities––Energy Services.” The time period until the next required analysis may be_
prolonged by the responsible authority under certain circumstances, particularly if no legionella were
identified in three consecutive annual tests. The results of the analysis have to be communicated both
to the health authority and to the consumers of drinking water. Costs for the legionella analysis may be
contractually allocated by the landlord to tenants as operating costs.

**_Operation of Smart Meters for Electricity Consumption_**

Germany (but also the European Union in general) is currently promoting the roll-out of “smart meters,”
i.e., electronic metering devices with added functionality such as hourly recording of energy
consumption, wireless connection and two-way communication etc., for metering electricity
consumption. In Germany, the Law on the Operation of Smart Meters, (Messstellenbetriebsgesetz,
“MsbG”), enacted in 2016, creates the regulatory framework for an overall digital electricity
infrastructure. Under the MsbG, smart metering systems, i.e., a modern meter which is connected to a
communication network via an SMGW, have to be installed from 2025 on for end-users (i) with an
annual electricity consumption over 6.000 kWh or (ii) with a controllable consumption device such as
for example a wall box for charging electronic vehicles. Furthermore, smart metering systems have to
be installed for operators of plants (such as photovoltaic systems) with an electricity generation capacity
of more than 7 kW. This installation obligation sits with the metering point operator who, by default, is
the local electricity network operator (so called “basic metering point operator”). However, this activity
may also be conducted by any other third party (so-called “competitive metering point operator”)
meeting the statutory requirements. Below the 6.000 kWh threshold installation is optional.
Furthermore, all end-users have to be equipped at least with modern meters until 2032 irrespective of
the respective electricity consumption.

The MsbG currently primarily applies to the metering of electricity consumption and similarly detailed
provisions do not exist for the mandatory smart metering of gas consumption. However, with regard to
gas, the MsbG already provides that (notwithstanding limited transitional provisions for certain types
of gas meters) new gas meters may only be installed if they are technically able to be safely connected
to an SMGW.

The smart meter rollout has so far only made slow progress in Germany compared to other countries
due to legal uncertainties and bureaucratic obstacles. Therefore, the German Act to Restart the
Digitisation of the Energy Transition (Gesetz zum Neustart der Digitalisierung der Energiewende, so
called “Smart Meter Act”) which aims to allow for an unbureaucratic and speedy rollout of smart
electricity meters by reforming the MsbG has entered into force in May 2023. This amendment of the
MsbG provides for a rollout roadmap with binding targets by 2025, 2028, 2030 and 2032, requiring
metering point operators to gradually equip metering points with smart metering systems. Under the
amended MsbG, the installation of smart metering systems will no longer require the Federal Office for
Information Security (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, BSI) to first declare that
the smart meter rollout is “technically possible,” i.e., that three independent companies offer SMGWs


-----

fulfilling all requirements of the MsbG. Therefore, SMGWs that have been certified can already be
rolled out. To create a financial incentive for the installation of smart metering systems to end-users,
the Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz) requires all electricity suppliers from January 1,
2025, to offer dynamic electricity tariffs to all end-users with a smart metering system (since 2022 this
obligation already applies to electricity suppliers which supply more than 100,000 end-users with
electricity). Furthermore, the MsbG provides for price caps until which the installation of smart
metering systems is considered to be economically feasible. The cost of smart metering systems for
private households and small plant operators will be capped at €20 per year, meaning network operators
will bear most of the costs. For consumers with a controllable consumption device (in accordance with
Paragraph 14a of the Energy Industry Act), a price cap of €50 per year will apply. Tenants and landlords
(if certain requirements are fulfilled) have the right to choose a different metering point operator, which
allows for efficiencies for submetering companies. A landlord’s right to choose takes precedence over
that of the tenant, provided the metering point operator commits to (i) equip all metering points of a
property with smart metering systems, (ii) provide metering services not only for electricity but also for
at least one additional media (gas, district or local heating) and (iii) not charge more than the total costs
for all individual metering services.

**_German Climate Action Program 2030 and Climate Emergency Program 2022_**

On October 9, 2019, the German government approved the Climate Action Program 2030, which
represents a step towards implementing the Climate Action Plan 2050. A key outcome of the Climate
Action Program 2030 was the adoption of the German Fuel Emissions Trading Act
(Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz, BEHG) and the introduction of a national emission trading system
for CO2 emissions from certain fuel sources, which requires suppliers of fuel sources to pay a certain
price for the CO2 contained in their fuel source. This has generally led to higher costs for, e.g., heating
and hot water supply to buildings as suppliers of fuel pass on the additional costs to their customers.
Initially, tenants had to bear all of these costs. Under the more recently enacted German Carbon Dioxide
Cost Allocation Act (Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz), as of January 1, 2023, landlords and
tenants will both share in the costs. The share of costs covered by the landlord depends on the type of
rent as well as the energy efficiency of the respective building. Cost allocation is part of the billing
submetering services we offer to our customers. In addition, the fact that allocation of costs depends in
part on the energy efficiency of the respective building, landlords have an incentive to invest in the
energy efficiency of their properties, which may have a positive impact on the services we offer.

**_Energy Efficiency Solutions_**

On June 23, 2021, the Climate Emergency Program 2022 (Klimaschutz-Sofortproramm 2022) was
adopted. It foresees complementary measures to achieve the continuously adjusted climate targets,
partly affecting the building sector. For example, subsidies for energy-efficient buildings will be
increased, whereas starting in 2023, there will be no more subsidies for heating systems solely reliant
on fossil fuels. Most recently, on October 4, 2023, the German cabinet adopted the Climate Protection
Program 2023 (Klimaschutzprogramm 2023). The program includes measures relating to the building
sector, e.g., the amendment of the Building Energy Act. This primarily aims to advance the
transformation away from fossil fuel-based heating systems, supported by modified subsidies,
specifically for heating systems powered by renewable sources.

**_Energy Contracting_**

Our energy contracting business segment procures, converts and supplies usable energy to our
customers, mostly residential real estate owners by planning, financing, constructing and operating
boilers, heat stations and small CHP-units. See “Business––Our Business Activities––Energy Efficiency
_Solutions.” These services are subject to a variety of regulatory requirements._

The Ordinance on the General Conditions for the Supply of District Heating (Verordnung über
_Allgemeine Bedingungen für die Versorgung mit Fernwärme, AVBFernwärmeV) mainly stipulates rules_
for agreements between providers of district heating and their customers if the provider uses


-----

standardized terms and conditions in its agreements that are not negotiated. This is typically but not
always the case as agreements with some customers in the Energy Contracting business may be
negotiated individually. According to the established case law of the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof), district heating exists where a person independently and on the basis of
commercial principles produces heat in a heating installation not owned by the respective property
owner which is then supplied to third parties. The Federal Court of Justice further established that the
AVBFernwärmeV is only applicable in case the supplier has made high investments in the heating
installations which justify granting the supplier the option of agreeing on a term of up to ten years under
the AVBFernwärmeV. Our agreements which are subject to the AVBFernwärmeV must comply with
the requirements set out therein, in particular with regard to price adjustment clauses and clauses
relating to the term of the agreement. Price adjustment clauses must include a cost and a market element
and have to be sufficiently transparent. Due to changes in the law, the supplier can, in principle, no
longer unilaterally change the price adjustment clause by public announcement. However, a unilateral
amendment of the price adjustment clause may be possible–although this is controversial–if the price
adjustment clause has become invalid for example due to changed market circumstances and
particularly in case such invalidity was unavoidable for the seller. We have individual contracts with
our customers and do not supply based on fixed price metrics (Tarifgebiete).

The KWKG aims to promote the generation of electricity produced in CHP-units. The KWKG requires
network operators to connect highly efficient (within the meaning of Directive 2012/27/EU) CHP-units
immediately and as a priority to their networks and to transmit and distribute the generated electricity.
For CHP-units with less than 100 kW operators are entitled to request the grid operator to take the
electricity produced by the cogeneration unit in return for a customary payment (which is then based
on the average price of base load energy at the European Energy Exchange in the previous quarter).
Regardless of the size of the CHP-unit, the network operator is obliged to pay a bonus (Zuschlag) for
the electricity produced in CHP-units, provided that the electricity is marketed by the plant operator or
purchased by the network operator. Depending on the characteristics of the specific CHP-unit (in
particular its electrical capacity), the actual amount of the bonus payment is either determined in a
competitive tender process or by statutory law, i.e., by the respective amounts set out in the KWKG.
The bonus payment is in both cases limited in time. The maximum amount of all bonus payments under
the KWKG may not exceed € 1.8 billion per calendar year. In addition, the portion of the network fee
that is avoided by the decentralized electricity feed in of this CHP-unit as currently calculated according
to the Ordinance on the Fee for Access to Electricity Power Networks (Stromnetzentgeltverordnung) is
added to the bonus payment for the CHP-units not subject to tendering. Insofar as we feed the electricity
generated by CHP-units into the grid systems, we are entitled to the payments under the KWKG if we
fulfill the necessary requirements.

The EEG provides for funding schemes for operators of renewable power plants. The feed-in tariff
model and the market premium model are the main funding schemes, with the market premium model
being the standard scheme. Under the feed-in tariff model, operators sell electricity to the respective
Transmission System Operator (“TSO”) and obtain a long-term fixed price specific to the energy source
used to generate electricity. In return, the TSOs sell the generated electricity on the market. By contrast,
operators participating in the market premium model sell the generated electricity directly on the market
(or employ a third-party direct marketer to do so on their behalf). They obtain a so-called market
premium that represents the difference between the average electricity exchange market price of that
particular energy source and a strike floor price determined specifically for this type of energy.
Especially for plants receiving support for the first time from 2017 onwards, this value is in most cases
determined in a tendering procedure. For electricity from plants that were commissioned before January
1, 2023, the amount of the market premium is calculated on the basis of the monthly market value
specific to the energy source. For newer plants, this is calculated on the basis of the energy sourcespecific annual market value. Due to the recently agreed EU electricity market reform, EEG support for
new installations will in the future only be granted on the basis of double-sided contracts-for-difference
subject to a transition period. The Council and the Parliament agreed on the implementation of a doublesided contract-for-difference scheme in a trilogue procedure for a Regulation to improve the European
Union’s Electricity Market Design. It is expected that the respective European laws will be amended as


-----

stipulated in the compromise. As a result, Member States will have to change their funding schemes
and national laws, including the EEG. Notably, two-sided contract-for-difference schemes will become
mandatory only for investments in new power-generating facilities. However, existing facilities subject
to the current funding schemes are grandfathered and will not be affected. This obligation is set to take
effect (in principle) three years after the date of entry into force of the new Regulation with the exception
of offshore hybrid asset projects connected to two or more bidding zones for which the transition period
is five years.

We produce electricity with our approximately 300 CHP-units (including 20 units that we have leased
to a third-party operator) under service from both renewable energy sources and natural gas. As a result,
we are entitled to remuneration according to the KWKG and the EEG. However, we may not claim
remuneration under the EEG and the KWKG simultaneously but must opt for remuneration either under
the EEG or under the KWKG for the amounts of electricity produced by the individual CHP-units.

The conditions under which remuneration may be claimed under the KWKG and the EEG have been
restricted by amendments to both acts, making remuneration payments for a large number of
installations subject to an award in a competitive tender process. It is possible that the remuneration
schemes for both CHP-units and installations generating electricity by using renewable sources may
become more restrictive in the future. See “Risk Factors––Risks Related to Our Business––Operators
_of combined heat and power units in Germany may benefit from price support schemes under the Act_
_on Combined Heat and Power Generation and the Act on Renewable Energy Sources. Recent and future_
_amendments to these regulations could have a negative impact on our business.”_

Depending on the rated thermal input and the fuel used (for example, coal, gas or oil), conventional
heat generating plants and/or CHP-units may require a license under the German Imissions Control Act
(Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz). The licenses are tied to the obligation to avoid harmful effects to the
environment or any other hazards, significant disadvantages and significant nuisances to the general
public and the neighborhood, and to take precautions to prevent any harmful effects to the environment
or any other hazards, significant disadvantages and significant nuisances, particularly by such measures
as are appropriate according to the best available techniques. Depending on their size, energy plants
may also be subject to environmental impact assessment requirements under the German Environmental
Impact Assessment Act (Gesetz über die Umweltverträglichkeitsprüfung) during the licensing process.
Even in case CHP-units do not require a license under imissions control laws, they must still comply
with the general requirements of the German Emissions Control Act, which are always applicable even
to installations not requiring a license.

In 2010, the EU adopted Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings (Energy
Performance of Buildings Directive, “EPBD”) which has been amended several times in the meantime.
The principal objective of the EPBD is to improve energy performance of buildings through costefficient metering. EU member states have to implement a methodology for the calculation of the energy
performance of buildings and set regulations of minimum energy requirements for new and existing
buildings. Detailed calculations are determined by each EU member state on its own in a frame set by
the EPBD. Additionally, EU member states are obliged to ensure that energy performance certificates
are issued, in particular whenever a building is constructed, sold or rented out, and that inspections of
boilers and heating systems are carried out. Currently, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council
are in the process of amending the EPBD again and have achieved a provisional agreement on
December 7, 2023. It is expected that the EPBD will be adopted in 2024. The agreed amendment sets
out more ambitious goals for energy-efficient renovation of residential buildings and requires new
publicly-owned buildings to be emission-free as from 2028 and all other new building as from 2030,
with the possibility for specific exemptions. Furthermore, the amendment provides that where
technically, economically and functionally feasible, new residential buildings and residential buildings
undergoing major renovation are to be equipped with electronic monitoring and control functionalities.
Other features that could lead to additional growth areas for us are the so-called “Smart Readiness
Indicator,” a common EU scheme for rating the smart readiness of buildings and the obligation for
certain buildings to be equipped with devices for the monitoring and regulation of indoor air quality.


-----

The EPBD was initially implemented into German law by the German Act on Energy Savings
(Energieeinsparungsgesetz) and the German Energy Savings Ordinance (Energieeinsparverordnung)
which have by now been consolidated into the German Buildings Energy Act (Gebäudeenergiegesetz).
This law includes standards that energy installations in buildings need to comply with, for example the
requirement that part of the energy used for heating and cooling must come from renewable sources. It
aims at a largely climate-neutral inventory of existing buildings by 2045 and around 40% savings in
final energy consumption through efficiency measures on the building envelope and construction
technology compared with 2020. The German Buildings Energy Act sets out specific requirements for
energy certificates for buildings.

The most recent amendment to the German Buildings Energy Act is that as of October 2023, newly
installed heating systems must run on at least 65% of renewable energy. However, this requirement is
linked to the German Act for Heat Planning and Decarbonization of Heat Networks (Gesetz für die
_Wärmeplanung und zur Dekarbonisierung der Wärmenetze), which entered into force on January 1,_
2024. The German Act for Heat Planning and Decarbonization of Heat Networks requires the federal
states (Bundesländer) to develop heat plans, with municipalities expected to take on this task. Heat
plans must be developed in large cities (municipal areas with more than 100,000 inhabitants) by
June 30, 2026, and in municipalities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants by June 30, 2028. The
obligation of 65% is not mandatory until a heat plan is in place. Therefore, this provision only applies
as of 2024 and only to heating systems in new buildings in areas of new residential developments. New
oil and gas heating systems can continue to be installed in existing buildings and new buildings outside
of new development areas until the respective municipality has presented a plan for the transition to
climate-neutral heating.

Under the German Electricity Tax Act (Stromsteuergesetz), tax relief for the electricity used to produce
light, heat and other forms of secondary energy are granted to manufacturing companies (Unternehmen
_des Produzierenden Gewerbes) if the secondary energy is used by a manufacturing company._
Furthermore, CHP operators are entitled to tax relief under the German Energy Tax Act
(Energiesteuergesetz), especially if natural gas or heating oil is used in CHP plants. Manufacturing
companies may also be granted partial tax reliefs in other cases, provided the secondary energy
produced by the energy product is used by a manufacturing company.

**_Ability to Allocate Costs of Energy Contracting_**

Pursuant to Section 556c of the BGB, a landlord of residential and commercial units is expressly entitled
to allocate the costs of energy contracting to tenants if (i) the tenants are contractually obligated to bear
the costs of heating or hot water, (ii) heat is delivered in a more efficient way than before (either by new
installation by the contractor or by a heat energy network) and (iii) the energy contracting solution is
cost neutral for the tenant. If the annual efficiency rate of an existing installation is 80% or more, it is
sufficient that the energy contractor improves the efficiency of the operation of the energy delivery
(rather than complying with clause (ii) above). The cost neutrality is determined in a calculation formula
set forth in the WärmeLV. According to Sections 8-10 WärmeLV, cost neutrality would be achieved if
the expected annual costs of the energy contracting solution to the tenants would not have exceeded the
average heating and hot water costs paid by the tenants in the last three years (calculated based on the
volume utilized in those last three years and prices of the last year, taking into account price
adjustments). The above rules are mandatory for residential rent agreements. The rules apply to all cases
where a rent agreement is in place and the contracting system has been, or is, implemented at any time
since July 1, 2013, during the lifetime of an existing rent agreement. For those rent agreements, the
former case law of the Bundesgerichtshof that the landlord can introduce energy contracting without
tenant’s consent if the rent agreement referred to the Ordinance on Operative Costs
(Betriebskostenverordnung) or the predecessor ordinance (Annex 3 to the Second Calculation
Ordinance—Anlage 3 zur IL Berechnungsverordnung) or provided otherwise for the allocability of
costs of close-range heating or energy contracting, has by now become obsolete.


-----

By contrast, the requirements of Section 556c of the BGB do not apply to energy contracting
arrangements lawfully implemented before the enactment of Section 556c of the BGB on July 1, 2013,
or to new rent agreements where energy contracting has already been implemented. This legislation,
especially the requirement of cost neutrality, may negatively affect the possibility for our customers to
pass on costs for energy contracting. See “Risk Factors––Risks Related to Our Business––Restrictions
_on our customers’ ability to allocate the costs of our services to their tenants may discourage them from_
_utilizing our services and thus adversely affect our results of operation. In addition, price adjustment_
_provisions in our customer contracts may be held invalid by courts.” The requirement of cost neutrality_
also potentially limits our customer’s ability to switch to energy contracting based on renewable energy
sources, as they may not be cost competitive.

**_Techem Water Technology_**

Techem also provides services to its customers and supplies equipment to protect drinking water
systems and building pipes against calcification or corrosion. In this context, special requirements from
the Drinking Water Ordinance (Trinkwasserverordnung) must be observed. This includes the regulation
in accordance with Section 13 Paragraph 5 of the Drinking Water Ordinance according to which only
certain substances or objects may be used in the extraction, treatment and distribution of drinking water
which are intended for the supply of drinking water. Already introduced substances or objects which
do not serve the purpose of drinking water supply must be removed from the raw water or drinking
water by January 9, 2025. This also applies to procedures already in use which are not intended to
supply drinking water. Nevertheless, it is unclear to what extent the procedures used by Techem to
protect against calcification and corrosion are also affected.

TopCo, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Germany, which in turn is a wholly
owned subsidiary of Lux TopCo, a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée)
incorporated under Luxembourg law. The Sponsors indirectly hold all of the share capital of Lux
TopCo.

As of December 31, 2023, entities managed or controlled by Partners Group held 59.63% of the share
capital of Lux TopCo, by CDPQ held 24.50% and by OTPP held 15.87% of the share capital of Lux
TopCo, respectively.

**Related Party Transactions**

In the course of our ordinary business activities, we regularly enter into agreements with companies
within the Group. These agreements mainly relate to the supply of metering devices, to the granting of
licenses and the rendering of intragroup services, such as the provision of software and IT, treasury,
controlling and other services as well as marketing services. In addition, entities within our Group enter
into financing and cash pooling agreements.

We believe that all transactions with subsidiaries are negotiated and executed on an arm’s-length basis
and that the terms of these transactions are comparable to those currently contracted with unrelated
third-party suppliers and service providers.

We have also engaged in various financing transactions with our shareholders in connection with the
Acquisition.

**Management and Support Services Agreement**

Following the Acquisition, we entered into a management and support services agreement with a related
company of certain of our shareholders, pursuant to which the related company of certain of our
shareholders provides financial oversight, monitoring services and other advisory services to the Group
throughout the year for an annual fee. In the financial year ended September 30, 2023, we paid a service
fee pursuant to this agreement to the related company of certain of our shareholders amounting to €8.5
million (the "Service Fee”). The Service Fee is not a related party transaction under IAS 24 (Related
Party Disclosures).

**Management Equity Participation Program and Long-Term Incentive Plan**

In connection with the Acquisition, one of the Sponsors established a management equity participation
(“MEP”) program in March 2019. The subscribing managers entered into an equity participation
agreement (“Equity Participation Agreement”) governing their rights and obligations in connection with
their investments in German TopCo. The Equity Participation Agreement contains customary
provisions, including the opportunity to invest indirectly in the Group and to share in any increase in
value through their own investment. The management participation program is accounted for as equitysettled share-based payment. In spring 2022, a long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) was launched as a
further share-based program. This initially provides for an opportunity to certain of our employees to
participate on the same terms as in the MEP above. In addition, both the MEP and the LTIP provide for
an exit bonus, which will be paid out in the event of defined exit scenarios.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, entered into a senior facilities agreement on July 19, 2018 (the “Initial
Senior Facilities Agreement”) with, among others, Credit Suisse AG, London Branch as agent, the
Security Agent, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV, Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft, Crédit Agricole
Corporate and Investment Bank Deutschland, Niederlassung einer Französischen Société Anonyme,
Credit Suisse AG, London Branch, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, Natixis, NatWest Markets
PLC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Dusseldorf Branch, UniCredit Bank AG as mandated
lead arrangers and the original lenders as set out therein. The Initial Senior Facilities Agreement
provided for a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of €275.0 million (the “Revolving Credit
Facility”) and a senior term loan facility (“Facility B” and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility,
the “Senior Credit Facilities”). On July 31, 2018 (such date being the “Effective Date”), the senior
facilities agreement dated August 3, 2017 with, among others, Techem GmbH and the lenders named
therein (the “Existing Senior Facilities Agreement”) was amended, restated and merged with the Initial
Senior Facilities Agreement. The resulting credit agreement had commitments under Facility B in an
aggregate principal amount equal to €2,340.0 million. Facility B initially comprised two tranches,
Facility B1 and Facility B2 which were each utilized in full on July 31, 2018. On July 25, 2019, pursuant
to an additional facility notice dated July 24, 2019 from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to Credit Suisse
AG, London Branch as Agent (the “Facility B3 AFN”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer refinanced the
two Facility B tranches, Facility B1 and Facility B2, with a single €2,340.0 million additional term loan
facility, Facility B3. Facility B3 was utilized in full on July 25, 2019. Pursuant to an additional facility
notice dated January 27, 2020 from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to Credit Suisse AG, London
Branch as Agent (the “Facility B4 AFN”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer established an additional
term loan facility (“Facility B4”) in an amount equal to €1,145.0 million which was drawn in full and
the proceeds were used, together with the proceeds of the 2% Notes due 2025, to refinance Facility B3
in full. On October 25, 2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into an amendment and
restatement agreement to the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, pursuant to which the final maturity
date of the Revolving Credit Facility was extended from the date falling 78 Months after the initial
utilization date of Facility B to the date falling 83 Months after the initial utilization date of Facility B
(the “RCF Maturity Extension”). On March 14, 2024, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into a
further amendment and restatement agreement to the Existing Senior Facilities Agreement, pursuant to
which, with effect from the “Effective Date” (as defined therein, the “Facility B5 Effective Date”) (i) a
new term facility will be established in an amount equal to €1,800.0 million (“Facility B5”) with an
extended maturity date of 15 July 2029 and (ii) a new revolving credit facility will be established in an
amount equal to €375.0 million (“Revolving Credit Facility 2”) with an extended maturity date of 15
January 2029 (or (x) if the First Maturity Reset Event occurs, 15 June 2025, or (y) if the Second Maturity
Reset Event occurs, 30 March 2026) (the “Senior Facilities Extension and Upsize”). The Facility B5
Effective Date is expected to occur on or around the Issue Date and the proceeds of Facility B5 will be
drawn on the Facility B5 Effective Date and used in part to refinance Facility B4 in full and in part to
refinance a portion of the 2% Notes due 2025. Following the establishment of the Revolving Credit
Facility 2 on the Facility B5 Effective Date, the Revolving Credit Facility will be permanently reduced
to an amount equal to €23,375,000 with the remainder of the drawn amounts under the Revolving Credit

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the Senior Credit Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Credit Facilities currently bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR
(or in the case of Revolving Credit Facility loans drawn in pounds sterling or US dollars, SONIA or
term SOFR (as applicable)) plus an applicable margin, which is subject to a decreasing margin ratchet
based on the ratio of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (each as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (the “Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio”).

The margin applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility is currently subject to adjustment by reference
to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as shown in the then most recent compliance certificate, to
equal the rate per annum set out in the following table:


-----

**Revolving Credit**
**Facility Margin**
(% p.a.)
**Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio:**
Greater than 5.55x ................................................................................................................. 2.75
Greater than 5.30x but equal to or less than 5.55x ................................................................ 2.50
Greater than 5.05x but equal to or less than 5.30x ................................................................ 2.25
Greater than 4.80x but equal to or less than 5.05x ................................................................ 2.00
Equal to or less than 4.80x .................................................................................................... 1.75

From the first day following six months following the date of first utilization of Facility B5, the margin
applicable to Facility B5 is subject to adjustment by reference to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
as shown in the then most recent compliance certificate, to equal the rate per annum set out in the
following table:

**Facility B5**
**Margin**
(% p.a.)
**Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio:**
Greater than 4.00x ................................................................................................................... 3.75
Greater than 3.50x but equal to or less than 4.00x .................................................................. 3.50
Equal to or less than 3.50x ...................................................................................................... 3.25

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made in euro
under Facility B or the Revolving Credit Facility (as applicable). If term SOFR or SONIA is less than
zero, term SOFR or SONIA (as applicable) shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
the Revolving Credit Facility in US dollars or pounds-sterling, as applicable.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncanceled amount of the Revolving Credit
Facility (excluding Revolving Credit Facility 2) from the date of first utilization of Facility B1 to the
end of the availability period applicable to the Revolving Credit Facility (excluding Revolving Credit
Facility 2) at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility. A commitment
fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncanceled amount of the Revolving Credit Facility
2 from the date of first utilization of Facility B5 to the end of the availability period applicable to the
Revolving Credit Facility 2 at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.
Commitment fees are payable quarterly in arrears and on the date of the Revolving Credit Facility is
canceled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender(s) cancels its commitment.

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loan(s) made under Facility B1, Facility B2 and Facility B3 are required to be repaid in full on the
date which is seven years from the date of first utilization of Facility B1. The loan(s) made under Facility
B4 are required to be repaid in full on 15 July 2025. The loan(s) made under Facility B5 will be required
to be repaid in full on 15 July 2029. In respect of the Revolving Credit Facility, each advance is required
to be repaid on the last day of the interest period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll-over cash
drawings. All outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility are required to be repaid on the
date falling 83 months from the date of first utilization of Facility B1. All outstanding amounts under
the Revolving Credit Facility 2 will be required to be repaid on 15 January 2029 (or (x) if the First
Maturity Reset Event occurs, 15 June 2025, or (y) if the Second Maturity Reset Event occurs, 30 March
2026). “First Maturity Reset Event” means if as of 15 June 2025, the aggregate principal amount of 2%
Notes due 2025 with a final maturity date on or prior to 15 July 2025 together with any outstanding
amounts under Facility B4 is greater than €750.0 million. “Second Maturity Reset Event” means if as
of 30 Mach 2026 the First Maturity Reset Event has not occurred and the aggregate principal amount
of Senior Notes with a final maturity date of 30 July 2026 is greater than €363.9 million. Amounts


-----

repaid by the borrowers in respect of loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility may be
reborrowed, subject to certain conditions.

**_Mandatory Prepayment_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement permits voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to certain _de_
_minimis amounts) and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances:_

- on an initial public offering which does not constitute a change of control (with the percentage
of proceeds to be prepaid being determined on the basis of Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio)
(a “Listing Prepayment”);

- from certain net cash proceeds received by the Senior Secured Group from certain asset
disposals, to the extent not otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied
in prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount; and

- unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, for each
financial year (commencing with the first full financial year following the date on which
Facility B is first utilized), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess cash flow
exceeds a minimum threshold amount (subject to certain adjustments based on a variety of
factors including anticipated debt service, distributions to be paid to minority shareholders and
certain other expenses), which percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
decreases (an “Excess Cash Flow Prepayment”).

Upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), each lender
under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be entitled to require prepayment of its commitments within
a prescribed time period. A change of control includes, without limitation:

- any person becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, other than in connection with any transaction or series of transactions in
which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall become the wholly owned subsidiary of a parent
entity (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) subject to certain conditions;

- the Senior Notes Issuer (together with any designee holding shares as a result of certain
regulatory requirements binding on Canadian pension schemes (a “30% Rule Designee”))
ceasing to own 100% of the share capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or any successor
or merger entity thereof); and

- the sale (or certain similar transactions) of substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured
Group (taken as a whole) to any person (subject to certain exceptions).

At the election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to a Listing
Prepayment or an Excess Cash Flow Prepayment may instead be applied in repayment of any other
indebtedness of the Senior Secured Group ranking pari passu with Facility B.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The Senior Credit Facilities are, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, guaranteed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors, and are secured by (i) first ranking pledges over
the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor; (ii) first ranking pledges
over the material bank accounts of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor; and
(iii) security assignment of structural intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer to its immediate holding company.

Subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles in the Senior Facilities Agreement
(elements of which are described below), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to ensure that


-----

members of the Senior Secured Group that generate at least 80% of the consolidated EBITDA of the
Senior Secured Group (subject to certain adjustments as set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement) are
guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement (i) on the date which is 90 days after the date on which
Facility B is first utilized and (ii) thereafter on the date on which the annual financial statements of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer are required to be delivered to the agent under the Senior Facilities
Agreement (provided that, if such guarantor coverage test is not met at the relevant date in (ii), no
default will arise provided that the test is met within 90 days of such date). The Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is also required to ensure that, subject to certain adjustments and agreed security principles,
certain material subsidiaries are guarantors under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The provisions and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject
to certain limitations (including certain agreed security principles and an ability for the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to request that documents are amended so as to reflect those agreed security principles).

**_Agreed Security Principles_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain “Agreed Security Principles” which regulate the terms
of security granted in connection with the Transactions. The effect of these is that certain property,
rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited
(or liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles (as defined and as set out in
full in the Senior Facilities Agreement). The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms
of the Agreed Security Principles:

(a) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled
foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital
maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of
an entity to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be
limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited
accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten business days but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any
such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

(b) a key factor in determining whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect
of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes,
notarial costs guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of the Group and all
applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured
Parties (as defined herein) of obtaining such guarantee or security;

(c) members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents
if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or
statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual
prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal
liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the
extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security document or
accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a contractual
prohibition or restriction only, use reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten
business days but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships


-----

with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security
document shall be subject to such limit;

(d) guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration
and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be
agreed between the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent;

(e) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will be granted over the material assets only;

(f) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security
over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

(g) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third
party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or
being subject to the applicable security document (including requiring a consent of any third
party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the
applicable security document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend
any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the group in respect of
the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of
the group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security
document, provided that reasonable endeavors (for a period of not more than ten (10) business
days but without incurring material cost) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where
otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date
of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is satisfied that such endeavors will not involve placing relationships with third parties
in jeopardy;

(h) the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of
the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability
of the relevant entity to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise
permitted (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or
amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in
each case prior to an acceleration event occurring under any relevant finance document which
is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of
any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this provision;

(i) any security document will only be required to be notarized if required by law in order for the
relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(j) in each case if requested by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, no guarantee or security will be
required to be given by or over any Acquired Person or Asset (as defined herein) (and no
consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to guarantee,
secure or otherwise credit support certain indebtedness (including acquired indebtedness) (or
in each case any refinancing indebtedness in respect of such indebtedness) to the extent such
indebtedness is permitted by the relevant finance documents to remain outstanding after an
acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not
prohibited by the relevant finance documents (or member of the group making such acquisition)
shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any relevant finance
document if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing the applicable debt or if
becoming a guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including
any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto. No security or lien in favor of the other
secured parties will be granted or continue to subsist over any asset of the Group secured for
the benefit of any permitted indebtedness (including applicable debt) and to the extent


-----

constituting a Permitted Lien (as defined in the relevant finance document including any similar
or equivalent definition);

(k) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be
required;

(l) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favor of a third party (other
than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not
prohibit or prevent the creation of such security over such accounts) or any cash constituting
regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant
security document);

(m) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favor of the Security Agent and not
the secured creditors individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of security
documents for all the relevant secured creditors); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where
necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual security
documents);

(n) no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any guarantees or
security as a result of any assignment, sub-participation or transfer by a secured creditor (and
unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the relevant finance documents no member of the
Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial registration or perfection fees
or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment, sub-participation or
transfer by a relevant secured creditor);

(o) each security document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not
prohibited under the relevant finance documents or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
granted under each security document entered into after the date on which the first utilization
occurs under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed
Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant security document and
creation of the relevant security;

(p) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(q) the secured creditors (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant
time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the
terms of the relevant finance documents prior to the occurrence of a relevant acceleration event
which is continuing;

(r) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations” defined in
accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled “Swap
Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update thereto by the LSTA;

(s) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action

**Senior Notes**

On July 30, 2018, the Senior Notes Issuer issued €465.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6%
Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”). The Senior Notes are governed by the Senior Notes
Indenture. The Senior Notes mature on July 30, 2026.

The Senior Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors on a senior subordinated basis. The Senior Notes
and the guarantees thereof are, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, secured (i) on a
first-priority basis by security interests over the shares in the Senior Notes Issuer and (ii) on a secondpriority basis by security interests over the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. See “—
_Intercreditor Agreement.”_

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the redemption date.

In connection with any tender offer for the Senior Notes (including any Change of Control Offer or
Asset Disposition Offer (each as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture)), if holders of not less than 90%
in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Senior Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Senior Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such holders, the Senior Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right to redeem the
Senior Notes that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal
to the price offered to each other holder of Senior Notes in such tender offer.

Upon the occurrence of certain defined events constituting a change of control, each holder of the Senor
Notes may require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Senior Notes at a price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts,
if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. However, a change of control will not be deemed to
have occurred if a consolidated total net leverage ratio of 7.20 to 1.00 is not exceeded in connection
with such event.

The Senior Notes Indenture provides for covenants and events of default that are consistent with the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as adjusted for the ranking and structural position of the Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture are governed by the laws of the State of New York.

The Senior Notes are listed and admitted to dealing on the Official List of the Exchange.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, €363.9 million of the Senior Notes remain outstanding
following.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer entered into an intercreditor agreement on July 19, 2018 between, among others,
the agent, arrangers and lenders under the Initial Senior Facilities Agreement, and the Security Agent.
On the Effective Date, the intercreditor agreement dated September 20, 2017, by and among, inter alios,
Techem Metering GmbH and Techem GmbH and the agent and security agent named therein, was
amended and restated and the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Topco Notes
Trustee (as defined therein) and the Security Agent, among others, acceded to such amended and
restated intercreditor agreement in such respective capacities. The Trustee shall accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement)
on or around the Issue Date. In this description, the “Intercreditor Agreement” refers to that amended
and restated intercreditor agreement and any reference in this description to “the date of the Intercreditor
Agreement” (or any derivatives thereof) refers to the Effective Date. By accepting a Note, holders of
the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and conditions of,
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Senior
Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor (as defined below) or Third Party Security Provider, when
payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party Security Providers, when
enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt
will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and
provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document
because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes and of the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to
them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing guarantee, debt arrangement or the assumption of any
liabilities (or any designated loan, commitment, tranche or facility thereof) and related security
arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien
Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities or Unsecured Liabilities
(each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental financing, guarantee or
debt arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate
any New Debt Financing, each agent in respect of any Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and
each other creditor party to a Transaction Security Document or a Topco Independent Transaction
Security Document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document,
promptly amend or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) in order to effect
the ranking, priority guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain conditions,
including as regards the terms of such new security (which shall be, unless otherwise required by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and subject to the Agreed Security Principles) substantially the same as
the terms of the existing Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case
may be). Any release and re-grant of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
may only be undertaken if (i) (1) required under the terms of the New Debt Financing; (2) necessary
under applicable law to give effect to the ranking as described under “—Priority of Security” above; or
(3) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has determined in good faith that it is either not possible or not
desirable to implement the New Debt Financing on terms satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
by instead granting additional Transaction Security or amending the terms of the existing Transaction


-----

Security, (ii) if any asset is to be released from Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as the case may be), promptly upon giving effect to that release, replacement Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) is regranted, subject to
applicable law, the Debt Documents, the Agreed Security Principles, guarantee limitation and the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement. Each Secured Party agrees (i) not to take any action to challenge the
validity or enforceability of additional Transaction Security by reason of it being expressed to be second
ranking (or any other lower ranking) and (ii) that additional Transaction Security may be granted by
any Debtor to secure all or any part of any Hedging Liabilities and/or New Debt Financing.

Any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of a New Debt Financing
or in respect of any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited by the
terms of the Finance Documents and which is incurred in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person
or any of its subsidiaries who becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement, the “Closing Date”), or (ii) a person that merges, consolidates or is otherwise
combined with a Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date, or (iii) the assets of or shares in any
person listed in paragraphs (i) or (ii) above or otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an
“Acquired Person or Asset”), shall be permitted to subsist (or to be granted in accordance with the
applicable terms) and there is no requirement to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt Document.

No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member
of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any
Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles, (ii) over any asset
required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted
Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
ratably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) or (iii) where the grant of such security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation in relation to or
constituting such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any
payment obligation but not including an obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the
benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities, (the creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time,
provided that following certain acceleration events under the Senior Facilities Agreement or any
Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of
the Senior Secured Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third Party Security Providers
and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “—Application of
Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than
those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of
assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an
event of default under the applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior


-----

Secured Discharge Date”), the Debtors may only make certain specified payments in respect of the
Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance with the finance documents governing such Second Lien
Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including the Senior Facilities
Agreement or any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement and any Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary
consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee
for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in
the case of amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under the Senior Facilities
Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Cash Management Facility Document or Senior Secured Notes Document.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in
paragraph (ii) of “—Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities” below.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which all
Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Second Lien Discharge Date”) (the “Priority
Discharge Date”), the Senior Notes Issuer, Topco Borrowers, Third Party Security Providers and other
members of the Senior Secured Group may only make payments (including any other direct or indirect
step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the
Intercreditor Agreement) under the Topco Liabilities or under any Topco Proceeds Loan (together the
“Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any holding company of the Senior Notes Issuer
or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities
only) (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Topco Payments”):

(i) if:

(A) no Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document
(a “Senior Secured Payment Default”), or under the Second Lien Facilities or Second
Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the
Topco Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any
required consents to permit such payment have been obtained, (2) any other amount
which is not an amount of principal or capitalized interest, such other amounts
including all scheduled interest payments (including, if applicable, special interest (or
liquidated damages), cash interest accrued during a period when a Topco Payment Stop
Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and default interest) accrued and payable in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco Finance Document (as at the date of
the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a result of
the tax gross-up provisions relating to the Topco Liabilities and amounts in respect of
currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a debt
buy-back program in relation to Topco Liabilities approved by the Majority Senior


-----

Secured Creditors, Majority Super Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien
Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy
letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or
(other than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a
guarantor or borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect
of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities
have accelerated their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior
ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien
Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any
Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees
under the original form of any fee letter(s) relating to the Topco Finance Documents; (B) of
commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
(including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring
advisors) fees, costs and expenses of a Topco Agent (as defined below) not included in (A)
above not exceeding €1,500,000, but excluding the costs of any current, threatened or pending
litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their affiliates); (C) of
any amounts owed to a Topco Agent (as defined below); (D) of costs necessary to protect,
preserve or enforce security; (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees
(including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses
incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in
relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance Documents); (F) of
any other amount not exceeding €5,000,000 in aggregate in any financial year of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried forward and
utilized in the subsequent financial year; (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which
would have been payable but for the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since
expired and no new Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalized and
added to the principal amount of the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a
result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such
period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be
made if certain events of default have occurred in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities or
Second Lien Liabilities or would occur as a result of making such payment; (H) for as long as
an event of default in relation to the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco
Group Liabilities which is continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or
otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issue of shares in any holding company of
the Senior Notes Issuer (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that (x) no cash or cash equivalent
payment is made in respect of the Topco Liabilities, (y) that it does not result in a Change of
Control as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement or Topco Finance Document and (z)
that any liabilities owed by a member of the Senior Secured Group to another member of the
Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the
Senior Notes Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are subordinated to
the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are granted
Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated
Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group; (I) of non-cash interest made by
way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non-cash-pay instrument which is subordinated to the
liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority Secured Liabilities”) on the same
terms as the Topco Liabilities; (J) audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and other proper and
incidental expenses required to maintain existence or any other reasonable and ordinary course
administrative and maintenance costs and expenses of a Topco Borrower or a direct or indirect
holding company thereof, the only material assets which are (directly or indirectly) shares in or
receivables from a Topco Borrower; (K) funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of
Topco Liabilities incurred under or pursuant to any Topco Finance Documents; (L) made by


-----

the Topco Borrower in respect of its obligations under the Topco Finance Documents, and such
payment is not directly or indirectly sourced from a member of the Senior Secured Group or
such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from the Senior
Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents; (M) a principal amount of
the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Topco Finance Document
relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to any other provisions that permits the
prepayment of a single lender without a related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors;
and (N) if no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred
and is continuing and the payment is of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or
after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date
is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document
as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco
Liabilities); or

(iii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority
Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below) give prior consent to that payment being made.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one business day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (each
as defined below)) issues a notice (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco
Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”)
advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing and suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the
first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors
(each as defined below) gave the instructions to deliver the relevant stop notice) delivers a
notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the
payment stop notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).


-----

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
Senior Secured Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the
occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be
served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the provisions summarized above in “Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions” and the
equivalent provisions in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities will release any Debtor from the liability
to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the applicable
Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual and
capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or (in respect
of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) to Topco or any party that has acceded to the
Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco Investor (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement, the
“Topco Investors”) an amount equal to any payments which had accrued under the Topco
Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would
have been Permitted Topco Payments but for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default (as the case may be), then any event
of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that
suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date (the “Topco Discharge Date”) on which all of
the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than
a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor,
member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to
the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either
(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;


-----

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the
Debt Documents;

(B) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction
Security as a result of such an acceleration event;

(C) as a result of any other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior
Secured Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of
an Insolvency Event (as defined below)); or

(D) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of
an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such
an acceleration event, other than amounts received or recovered in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and in respect of IntraGroup Liabilities and amount permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement
notwithstanding that an acceleration event is continuing.

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party
Security Provider which is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—
_Application of Proceeds” and which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an_
Insolvency Event (as defined below) in respect of that Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or Third Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(vi) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent
and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount
equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(vii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after
the Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or
recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider
(x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or
following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the
charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of
_Proceeds” except in accordance with such provisions._


-----

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

_“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in the_
Senior Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or
making of an order for its insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration or
reorganization (excluding solvent reorganizations), (b) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (c) the appointment of any liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative receiver,
administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (d)
any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), (i) frivolous or
vexatious proceedings which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or dismissed within 20
business days of commencement or advertisement, (ii) in the case of an application to appoint an
administrator or (commence proceedings) any proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent
is satisfied will be withdrawn before it is heard or will be unsuccessful or as permitted under any Senior
Facilities Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a
default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary (each as defined in
the Senior Facilities Agreement) or Third Party Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured
Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the
Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security
Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below._

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities and set-offs
which would give effect to a payment or distribution not prohibited by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s
liabilities to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise
and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off
shall (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent that
such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities
owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance with
the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make
demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery
after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement), member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree
to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent
of an Instructing Group or otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.


-----

An “Instructing Group” means:

(a) If the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, Senior Secured Creditors (other than Super
Senior Creditors) representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other
than Super Senior Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”);

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date,
Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the
“Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco
Creditors”); and

(b) at any time on or after the Designation Date:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the
Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior
Discharge Date”), Majority Senior Secured Creditors, and Super Senior Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior
Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group
of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement
regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the
_Designation Date” and “—Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the_
_Designation Date” below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior
Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, Majority Second Lien
Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco
Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither
to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make
a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting
on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors
to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions
or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco
Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the
Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding
paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from
enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit. Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time
the agents or representatives of the Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the
Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security either gives such instruction or indicates
any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security


-----

Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall
act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii)
the Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in
good faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security
Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realization proceeds of any such enforcement,
before giving any such instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement
action the creditors represented by an Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other
agent (provided that any agent in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such
enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) for a period of up to ten business days or take any
Enforcement Action (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give
the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or after the Designation Date_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this section. If the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions they shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement
Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties and those
instructions shall be consistent with the Enforcement Principles (as defined below).

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below) and the Security Agent shall be entitled to assume that such
instructions are consistent with the Enforcement Principles) received from (i) the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, (ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the
method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the
Initial Enforcement Notice or if the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of
the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge
Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by
enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super
Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the
Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce
the Transaction Security or on the expected realization proceeds and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors deliver instructions before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date
has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors (as
applicable) have not given instructions or they (A) have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce (or
to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or (B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Majority Second Lien Creditors (where the rights of the
Majority Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement), or (vi) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they (A)
have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce (or to cease enforcing) the Transaction Security, or
(B) have not required any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the
Majority Topco Creditors (where the rights of the Majority Topco Creditors to enforce have arisen
under the Intercreditor Agreement).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions do not give such


-----

instructions and do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors to the extent that such group is entitled to give enforcement
instructions as described in the paragraph above may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce
the Transaction Security as they see fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions.

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realization of value, the method of
enforcement chosen should maximize the value realized from such enforcement, (ii) certain proceeds
must be received in cash and (iii) enforcement in relation to assets over €5,000,000 or shares if not
carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is
request to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit
from a fairness opinion from an investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm.

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the
Majority Topco Creditors) may give or refrain giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or
refrain from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of
any administrator of any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent)
as any persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any
such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse to enforce, any
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers
arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by instructing creditors in accordance with
the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Certain of the features set out below with respect to Topco Creditors may apply to the Second Lien
Creditors, with appropriate modifications for their relative position in the capital structure.

taking of any action by a member of the Topco Group not prohibited by the Finance Documents.

_Permitted Topco Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “—Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors” will not apply
in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities or the Transaction Security Documents (if any) securing the
Topco Group Liabilities, if:

(i) an event of default under a Topco Finance Document or a Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement
(the “Relevant Topco Default”) is continuing;

(ii) all agents or trustees in respect of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, and Second Lien Liabilities have received a notice of the Relevant Topco Default
specifying the event or circumstance in relation to the Relevant Topco Default from the Topco
Agent, the Topco Notes Trustee or the Topco Borrower in relation to the relevant Topco Group
Liabilities;

(iii) a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) has elapsed; and

(iv) the Relevant Topco Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Topco Standstill Period.

Promptly upon becoming aware of an event of default under a Topco Finance Document, a Topco Notes
Trustee, Topco Agent or Topco Investor (as the case may be) may give a Topco Enforcement Notice
notifying any agent under a Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement (the “Senior Agent”), senior
secured notes trustee and any agent or trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities of the existence
of such event of default.

“Topco Standstill Period” means the period beginning on the date (the “Topco Standstill Start Date”) a
Topco Enforcement Notice is served in respect of such a Relevant Topco Default and ending on the
earliest to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after the Topco Standstill Start Date (the “Topco Standstill Period”);

(ii) the date the Priority Secured Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
Debtor or Third Party Security Provider, provided that:

(A) if a Topco Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (ii), the Topco Creditors or
a Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may only
take the same Enforcement Action in relation to a Topco Guarantor as the Enforcement
Action taken by the Priority Secured Parties against such Topco Guarantor and not
against any other member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security
Provider; and

(B) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph (ii) shall not include action taken
to preserve or protect any security as opposed to realize it;

(iii) the date of an Insolvency Event (as defined above) in relation to a particular Topco Guarantor
against whom Enforcement Action is to be taken;


-----

(iv) the expiry of any other Topco Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Topco Standstill Period commenced (unless that expiry occurs as a result of a cure, waiver or
other permitted remedy); and

(v) the first date on which each of the Majority Super Senior Creditors, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have given their consent to
the relevant Enforcement Action.

The Topco Creditors or Topco Investor (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) may
take Enforcement Action under the provisions described in this section (Permitted Topco Enforcement)
in relation to a Relevant Topco Default even if, at the end of any relevant Topco Standstill Period or at
any later time, a further Topco Standstill Period has begun as a result of any other event of default in
respect of the Topco Liabilities.

_Option to Purchase: Topco Creditors_

Following acceleration, or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Topco Creditors may elect to
purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement), Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Second Lien
Lender Liabilities and Second Lien Notes Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to
prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Topco Creditors must
also elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders
in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such
hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection
with any such purchase.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to
any creating Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security Document
agrees that it shall (and is irrevocably authorized, instructed and obliged to do so without further
consent, agreement, instruction, direction confirmation payment, certification or other document,
request or information from any creditor Secured Party or Debtor from any creditor, other Secured Party
or Debtor) promptly following receipt of a written request from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer:

(i) release (or procure that any other relevant person releases) from the Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(A) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed is the subject of (1) a disposal not prohibited
under any Finance Document (or where any applicable release and/or consent has been
obtained) including a disposal to a member of the Senior Secured Group but without
prejudice to any obligation of any member of the Senior Secured Group in a Finance
Document to provide replacement security, and (2) any other transaction not prohibited
by any Finance Document (or where any applicable release and/or consent has been
obtained) pursuant to which that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of
the Senior Secured Group and, in each case, where such disposal is not a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or
other agreement requested in order for any member of the Senior Secured Group to
effect any amendment or waiver in respect of that document or agreement or otherwise
exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in relation to such
document or agreement, in each case to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document;


-----

(C) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any
member of the Senior Secured Group which has ceased to be a Debtor or guarantor (or
will cease to be simultaneously with such release) to the extent that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer has confirmed that such cessation is otherwise in accordance with the
terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles; and

(D) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to
the extent that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such security is not
required to be given or such release is otherwise in accordance with the terms of any
Finance Document or the Agreed Security Principles;

(ii) in the case of a disposal of shares or ownership interests in a Debtor or other member of the
Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) or any other transaction pursuant
to which a Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any
Debtor) will cease to be a member of the Topco Group or a Debtor (including by way of
resignation or being designated an Unrestricted Subsidiary), release (or procure that any other
relevant person releases) that Debtor or other member of the Senior Secured Group and its
subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the
respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries (and the shares in any such Debtor and/or
subsidiary) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and the
Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating to a Debt Document); and

(iii) to effect a transfer of the rights and obligations of the borrower or issuer of Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities under certain circumstances regulated
by the Intercreditor Agreement.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(A) or (i)(B) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer must confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is
not prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, on the date that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(C) or (i)(D) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall confirm in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given
or the relevant release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents
or the Agreed Security Principles.

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor or member of the Senior
Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) or any other transaction pursuant to which a
Debtor or member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company of any Debtor) will cease to be
a member of Topco Group or a Debtor (including by way of resignation or being designated an
Unrestricted Subsidiary), to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed to the Security
Agent that such disposal, transaction or designation is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such
member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt
Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all liabilities outstanding under any
Debt Document and any right to decline, delay or prevent any such prepayment in any Debt Document
shall be disapplied (but without prejudice to any prepayment fees, make-whole payment, break costs or
other payment required by the relevant Finance Documents).

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by
a member of the Senior Secured Group or, in the case of a Third Party Security Provider, any assets or
shares or financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a)
at the request of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become
enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a
result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement


-----

of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third Party Security Provider to a person
or persons which is not a member of the Senior Secured Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized
(subject to acting in accordance with certain conditions set out below and at the cost of the relevant
Debtor, Third Party Security Provider and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without any consent,
sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third
Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of
that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallization of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary
or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release (A) that
Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or
other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that
Debtor over any of its assets and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor,
Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities, (B) any Transaction Security
granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets and (C) any other claim of an intra- group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated
Creditor or a Debtor over that holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of
that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or
holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors under the Debt Documents or to any
Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver
or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not
be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does
intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of
any other liabilities, on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party
Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:


-----

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to
which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors
on behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in
respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be
transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described in paragraph (iv) above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the
proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities
as described in paragraph (iv) above has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities as described in paragraphs (iv) or (v)
above) effected by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable
care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall
not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to
achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities
or guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the
case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary
facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor)
following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is
not authorized to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those
borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien
Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of
credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral
arrangements acceptable to the relevant Senior Creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured Liabilities, Second
Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured
liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned
may elect to have those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost
of the relevant Debtor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority
or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so
transfer those borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities.

Subject to the provisions described below, if a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant
to paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected by or at the request of the Security Agent, unless the
consent of each Senior Agent and each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as applicable) has been obtained,
it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that:


-----

(i) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(ii) such sale or disposal is made (A) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process
conducted with the advice of a reputable, independent or financially recognized investment
bank or firm of accountants (or (if all such banks or firms are conflicted), a reputable,
independent and internationally recognized third party professional firm which is regularly
engaged in providing valuations of businesses or assets similar or comparable to those subject
to the relevant Transaction Security) and, in each, case not being an auditor or administrator of
the applicable company (a “Financial Adviser”) as selected by the Security Agent, in respect of
which the Secured Creditors are entitled to participate (a “Competitive Sales Process”); or (B)
where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security Agent has delivered an opinion to the
Security Agent (including an enterprise valuation of the Group) that the proceeds received or
recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking
into account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being
acknowledged that the Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial
Adviser unless it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Second Lien Liabilities or Transaction
Security securing Second Lien Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities has approved the release,
transfer or disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities
are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured
Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors being sold and disposed of and their
subsidiaries (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates),
and all security under documents creating security in respect of the secured obligations
in respect of the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is unconditionally
released and discharged, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Senior Secured
Creditors will recover a greater amount if the Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise
transferred to the purchaser or its affiliates and provided such amount is nevertheless
less than the aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities (which shall
be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and Senior
Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines that there are
no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all in cash in excess of
the outstanding amount of Senior Secured Liabilities), then the Security Agent shall be
entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its
affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to
a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security
Agent has delivered an opinion to the Security Agent (including an enterprise valuation
of the Group) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or
disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the


-----

Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it
has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

If before the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to
paragraphs (iv) and (v) above) is being effected such that any Topco Liabilities or Transaction Security
securing Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, it is a further condition to any release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) each agent and trustee in respect of any Topco Liabilities has approved the release, transfer or
disposal; or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Topco Liabilities are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash); and

(B) at completion of the sale or disposal the borrowing, guarantee and (to the extent
permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured
Creditors and Unsecured Creditors by the Debtors being sold and disposed of and their
subsidiaries (a “Relevant Claim”) are (to the same extent) unconditionally released and
discharged or sold or disposed of (and not assumed by the purchaser or its affiliates),
and all security under documents creating security in respect of the Secured Obligations
in respect of the assets of such members of the Senior Secured Group is unconditionally
released and discharged, provided that, if each Senior Agent and Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting
reasonably and in good faith) determines that the Priority Secured Parties will recover
a greater amount if the Relevant Claim is sold or otherwise transferred to the purchaser
or its affiliates and provided such amount is nevertheless less than the aggregate
amount of outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities (which shall be deemed to be the
case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent, Senior Secured Notes Trustee and
each agent and trustee in respect of any Second Lien Liabilities (acting reasonably and
in good faith) determines that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash
or substantially all in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the Priority Secured
Liabilities), then the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer
such Relevant Claim to the purchaser or its affiliate; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to
a Competitive Sales Process or where a Financial Adviser selected by the Security
Agent has delivered an opinion to the Security Agent (including an enterprise valuation
of the Group) that the proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or
disposal are fair from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant
circumstances including the method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the
Security Agent has no obligation to select or engage any Financial Adviser unless it
has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction).

When acting for the purposes of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall always act (i) if the
relevant Distressed Disposal is being effected by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security in
accordance with the provisions set out under “—Manner of Enforcement” above and (ii) in any other
case on the instructions of the Instructing Group or, in the absence of such instructions, as the Security
Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

each case only to the extent there are liabilities due from the relevant Topco Borrower
to such creditors);

(D) if none of the Debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any
Secured Debt Document, in payment to any other person whom the Security Agent is
obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor or Third Party Security Provider; and

(E) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

_Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts from time to time
received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Topco Document in connection
with the realization or enforcement of Topco Independent Transaction Security or any guarantees
provided by a Topco Guarantor (other than a member of the Senior Secured Group) (the “Topco
Recoveries”) shall be applied at any time as the Security Agent sees fit, in the following order of
priority:

(i) in discharging any Agent Liabilities in respect of the Topco Liabilities (to the extent related to
such Topco Recoveries), the Security Agent and any receiver or delegate, on a pari passu basis;

(ii) in payment of all costs and expenses incurred by any agent or Topco Creditor in connection
with any realization or enforcement of the Topco Independent Transaction Security taken in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any action taken at the request of
the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) for application towards the discharge of:

(A) the Topco Facility Liabilities; and

(B) the Topco Notes Liabilities, on a pro rata basis and ranking _pari passu between_
paragraphs (A) and (B) above;

(iv) if none of the Debtors, Third Party Security Providers or Topco Independent Obligors are under
any further actual or contingent liability in respect of the Secured Liabilities, in payment to any
other person whom the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any Debtor, Third Party
Security Provider or Topco Independent Obligor; and


-----

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after
the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position
that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the agents and trustees for the
Secured Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or
consent only affects one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably
be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written
agreement from the agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” above, the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement or the provisions set out under “—
_Turnover” above (other than an amendment or waiver which is consequential to or required to_
implement a Permitted Structural Adjustment (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement))
shall not be made without the consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the
relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien
Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that
the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such
Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge
Counterparty (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge
Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors) and (iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented
or authorized relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee
in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security
Agent may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release or waive any of
the requirements of or grant consents under, any Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent
Transaction Security Document which shall be binding on each party. The Security Agent may also and
is deemed to be irrevocably authorized and instructed by the Secured Creditors to (with the consent of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s request) amend, release and/or
retake any Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security Document
where such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity, protection or
priority of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security purported to be created
under such Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security Document,


-----

together with any related or consequential waiver, as certified to the Security Agent (including by reason
of a failure to register such Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security
Document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit set out in section 859 of the
Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also irrevocably waive any payment or
other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and any such amendment, release,
waiver and retake shall be binding on each party. Where any such amendment, release or waiver of, or
consent under any Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security
Document would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or,
as the case may be, Topco Independent Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of
enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed, the
prior consent of (i) each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and
the Topco Liabilities, (ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash
Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver
would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the
Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors) and (iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the
Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case
may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the paragraphs above under “—Required Consents” and under “—
_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under_
the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security claims or liabilities, or (ii) to any amendment waiver or consent,
which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under
“—New Debt Financing,” “—Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed Disposals” above. Any
release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt
Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Security Agent.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt
Documents will automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and
all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such
IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the
date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities) and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding
any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity and (iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents
(including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply to any holding
company of the IPO Pushdown Entity (such changes, taken together, an “IPO Debt Pushdown”).


-----

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the
Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security) and
each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement) or Topco Independent Obligor (excluding a Topco Independent Obligor that is a
member of the Senior Secured Group) will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the
Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50%
of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility
and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (in each case following the
relevant IPO), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from
the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities).

Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or
replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate the matters described in each of the above
paragraphs under the heading “—Provisions Following an IPO.”

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Documents to the contrary (other than any Transaction Security Documents or, as the case may
be, Topco Independent Transaction Security Documents, which are governed by German Law and need
to be notarized (beurkundet)).

**Leases**

Certain of our subsidiaries are party to leases totaling €112.6 million as of December 31, 2023 (with a
nominal amount of €155.7 million). The leases are not subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement.

**Hedging Obligations**

We enter into interest rate swaps from time to time in order to hedge against interest rate risk associated
with our borrowings that are subject to floating rates of interest, including the Senior Facility. As the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes have a fixed rate of interest, we do not anticipate entering
into any interest rate hedges in connection therewith.


-----

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

The following is a description of the €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of      % senior
secured notes due 2029 (the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft
675 mbH (formerly Blitz F18-675 GmbH), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of
Germany (the “Company”). You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this
“Description of the Notes” under the heading “—Certain Definitions” below. For purposes of this
“Description of the Notes,” references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer only to Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH and not to any of its Subsidiaries.

The Company will issue the Notes under an indenture to be dated on or about     , 2024 (the
“Indenture”), between, inter alios, the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below), U.S. Bank Trustees
Limited, as trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”) and as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security
Agent”), and Elavon Financial Services DAC, as paying agent, in a private transaction that is not subject
to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under,
incorporate by reference or include, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act,
including Section 316(b) thereof. Consequently, the Holders will not be entitled to the protections
provided under the Trust Indenture Act to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture,
including among other things, those requiring the Trustee to resign in the event of certain conflicts of
interest and to inform Holders of certain relationships between it and us.

The Company intends to use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date, together
with a portion of the proceeds from the Facility B, to (i) pay the purchase price for the Tendered 2%
Notes due 2025 (as defined below) pursuant to a tender offer (the “Tender Offer”), together with accrued
and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding the Tender Settlement Date (as defined below), (ii)
satisfy and discharge the Company’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the Remaining 2%
Notes due 2025 (as defined below) on or about the Issue Date by depositing an amount in cash sufficient
to redeem the entire outstanding principal amount of the Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 at par, together
with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, up to but excluding April 17, 2025 (the “Remaining 2% Notes
due 2025 Redemption Date”) with the trustee in respect of such Remaining 2% Notes due 2025 and (iii)
pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the foregoing. Whether the Company will
accept for purchase any 2% Notes due 2025 validly tendered in the Tender Offer is subject, without
limitation, to the successful completion of the Offering in an aggregate principal amount and on terms
that are satisfactory to the Company in its sole discretion on or prior to the settlement date of the Tender
Offer, currently expected to be April 18, 2024, subject to the right of the Company, in its absolute and
sole discretion, to extend, re-open, withdraw and/or terminate the Tender Offer, as applicable (the
“Tender Settlement Date”). The closing of the Offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the
Tender Offer. See “Use of Proceeds.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of
indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, the procedures
for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations,
release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security
Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes
and the Indenture and refers to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Since this
description of the terms of the Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Notes, the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations
of the Company and your rights. Copies of such documents will be available from us upon request on
and after the Issue Date.


-----

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement
and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act and will be subject to certain transfer restrictions.

**General**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future obligation of the Company that
is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including the obligations of the Company
under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the Company’s obligations
under its guarantee of the Senior Notes);

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such obligation or indebtedness;

- be Guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the
Company that are not Guarantors, including obligations to their trade creditors;

- mature on     , 2029; and

- be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances
may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). See “Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders will receive proceeds from the enforcement
of the Collateral (as defined below) on a pari passu basis with all indebtedness of the Company that is
secured on the Collateral and that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and the
Guarantees, including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement and certain Hedging
Obligations, _provided that, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant_
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain credit facility Indebtedness and
certain Hedging Obligations may be designated as having super senior priority pursuant to the operation
of the Intercreditor Agreement, in which case, such super senior priority Indebtedness will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral and certain distressed disposals
in priority to Holders of the Notes pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured_
_Notes—If the Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the_
_terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, creditors under the_
_Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness_
_permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor_
_Agreement ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid with_
_proceeds from the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior_
_Secured Notes.”_


-----

The Company is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own and no business
operations, material assets or liabilities other than its shares in Techem Metering GmbH and those
liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation, the Acquisition and the Transactions and its
operations are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company depends on the receipt of
funds from its Subsidiaries (whether in the form of dividends, other distributions, return on capital or
payments with respect to intercompany obligations) to meet its obligations, including its obligations
under the Notes. The Notes will be structurally subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and
other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Company’s
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors.

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for the purposes of the
Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” we will be permitted to designate certain of_
our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Any Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
any of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

As of December 31, 2023, on an unaudited as adjusted basis to give effect to the Transactions, we would
have had €2,864.8 million of outstanding total indebtedness (excluding shareholder indebtedness),
including €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes offered hereby,
€1,800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of borrowings under Facility B, €42.8 million of
drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, €363.9 million of Senior Notes, €155.7 million of lease
liabilities and €2.4 million of other third-party borrowings.

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed, jointly and severally, by Techem Metering GmbH,
Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH and Techem Solutions GmbH (formerly Techem
Energy Contracting GmbH) (together, the “Guarantors”) on a senior secured basis. In addition, if
required by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” certain other
Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee (as defined below) in the future.

Once granted, the Notes Guarantee of each of the Guarantors will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is not subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee (including such
Guarantor’s obligations under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
subordinated in right of payment to its Notes Guarantee, including such Guarantor’s obligations
under its guarantee of the Senior Notes;

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligation of that
Guarantor and its subsidiaries that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes
or the Notes Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of that
Guarantor that do not guarantee the Notes, including their obligations to trade creditors.

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Notes Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or unlawful financial assistance
under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect limitations under applicable law. In addition, the Notes
Guarantees will be further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles as described below
under “—Notes Guarantees—General.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under


-----

its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a
Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The insolvency and restructuring laws of Germany may not be_
_as favorable to you as the insolvency and restructuring laws of the United States or those of another_
_jurisdiction with which you are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests_
_in the Collateral, including fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and_
_enforceability.” The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the liability of each_
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of
_the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Company will issue €500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on     , 2029. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes (together with any Additional Notes) will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Indenture, including in respect of any amendment, waiver or other modification of the Indenture or
any other action by the Holders hereunder, except as otherwise provided in the Indenture.

**Interest on the Notes**

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Notes will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on      and     , commencing on     , 2024. Interest on the Notes will
be payable to the holder of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding the related
interest payment date.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid,
from the date it was most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not
a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be
entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will
not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

If the Company redeems any Global Notes on a date that is on or after the record date and on or before
the corresponding interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the
redemption date will be paid on the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose
Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

The right of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive the payment on such Notes will be
subject to the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (as defined below) will
be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the registered Holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be


-----

paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the Holder entitled thereto as
shown on the register of Holders for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and
_Registrar for the Notes” below._

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Company will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying
Agent). The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC (the “Paying Agent”).

The Company will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer
Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC and the initial Transfer Agent
will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
the Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate
transfers of the Notes on behalf of the Company.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Company may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. The Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which €500.0 million aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this offering. The Company may issue Notes (the “Additional Notes”)
from time to time under the Indenture, subject to compliance with the covenants contained in the
Indenture. Any series of Additional Notes shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes, except
in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate (defined
below) supplied to the Trustee (copying the Paying Agent):

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such
interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof, the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes;

(9) to reflect a change in tax law since the date of the Indenture in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(as defined below); and


-----

(10) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

It is intended, to the maximum extent possible, that such Additional Notes will be treated, along with
all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments
and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series in such Officer’s
Certificate; provided, however, that if any Additional Notes are not part of the same issue as the Notes
offered hereby under the Indenture for U.S. federal income tax purposes or if the Company otherwise
determines that any Additional Notes should be differentiated from any other Notes, such Additional
Notes may have a separate ISIN, Common Code or other securities identification number from such
Notes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of
the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes initially issued on
the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, the obligations of the Company pursuant to the Notes, including any payment
obligation resulting from a Change of Control Triggering Event, will be guaranteed, jointly and
severally, on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors (each, a “Notes Guarantee” and together, the
“Notes Guarantees”).

The Guarantors accounted for 74.4% of our EBITDA (excluding intercompany transactions) for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2023, accounted for 69.9% of our total revenue (excluding
intercompany revenue) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, and held 61.0% of our total
assets (excluding goodwill, equity investments in subsidiaries and intercompany transactions) as of
December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis to give effect to the Transactions,
our subsidiaries not guaranteeing the Notes had outstanding indebtedness of €2.4 million (excluding
intercompany loans) comprised of bank loans of various recently acquired small submetering
companies in Germany, as well as a local bank loan of Techem Brazil. Although the Indenture will limit
the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the issuance of Disqualified Stock of the Company and Preferred
Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the
Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Definitions—
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, certain Subsidiaries of the Company that
guarantee the Senior Facilities in the future or any Credit Facility or Public Debt, in each case, of the
Company or a Guarantor, will also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations
under the Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory
or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent
preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and
similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be disproportionate to the
benefit accruing to the Holders.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise required under
the Agreed Security Principles, to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws.


-----

By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly
less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate
_benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the_
_Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral”_
and “—The insolvency and restructuring laws of Germany may not be as favorable to you as the
_insolvency and restructuring laws of the United States or those of another jurisdiction with which you_
_are familiar; other limitations on the Guarantees and the Security Interests in the Collateral, including_
_fraudulent conveyance statutes, may adversely affect their validity and enforceability.”_

A portion of the operations of the Company are conducted through Subsidiaries that are not expected
to become Guarantors. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade
creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims
of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect
to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company
and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of
the Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of
Subsidiaries of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any).

**_Notes Guarantee Release_**

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) upon a sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition (including by way of consolidation, merger,
or amalgamation) of any Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale
of a holding company of such Guarantor) as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer
be a Restricted Subsidiary, or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the
Guarantor (other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary), in each case if such sale,
exchange, transfer or other disposition does not violate the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(3) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and
_Discharge,” respectively;_

(4) upon the release of the Guarantor’s Guarantee of any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;_ _provided that no other Indebtedness is at that time_
Guaranteed by the Guarantor that would result in the requirement that the Guarantor provide a
Notes Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional
_Guarantees”;_

(5) pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown;

(6) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(7) as described in the second paragraph of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees”;_


-----

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; _provided that the resulting, surviving or_
transferee Person is or becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such Permitted
Reorganization;

(9) upon payment in full of principal and interest and all other obligations on the Notes;

(10) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and Consolidation”; or

(11) upon the achievement of Investment Grade Status by the Notes.

The Trustee shall, subject to receipt of certain documentation requested pursuant to the Indenture, take
all necessary actions at the reasonable request and cost of the Company, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee
without the consent of the Holders and will not require any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Company will be required to make a notation on the Notes to reflect
any such release, termination or discharge.

**Security**

**_General_**

Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured on a firstpriority basis by Security Interests over:

(1) the shares in the Company;

(2) the shares in each of the Guarantors; and

(3) the material bank accounts of the Company and the Guarantors.

The Security Interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent on behalf of and for the
benefit of the Holders pursuant to the Security Documents. The Collateral will also secure on a firstpriority basis the liabilities under the Senior Facilities and certain Hedging Obligations, and may also
secure certain future Indebtedness. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Interests in the
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the_
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries,
including, subject to certain requirements described herein, Additional Notes, as permitted under the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents to the Security Agent on behalf of
the Holders and holders of the other secured obligations that are secured by the Collateral. Any other
assets subject to Security Interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the
Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Security Interests
in the Collateral will be subject to the limitations that are applicable to Notes Guarantees granted by the
same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under
or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose
or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors


-----

generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Indenture will provide that certain property, rights and assets may_
not be pledged, and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not
perfected), in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles. For a non-exhaustive summary of certain
terms of the Agreed Security Principles as they apply to the Senior Facilities, and which will apply to
the Notes, mutatis mutandis, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement.”

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. By its
nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Senior_
_Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted or difficult to enforce under certain circumstances.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (such security interests, the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between
(a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c)
the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders under the Indenture, (d) the trustee, the security agent
and the holders of the Senior Notes, and (e) the creditors of certain other Indebtedness (including
Indebtedness that may be Incurred in the future) permitted to be secured by such Collateral, respectively,
are established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides, among other things, that
the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are
secured equally and ratably by first-priority Security Interests in the Collateral, _provided,_ _however,_
subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” certain credit facility Indebtedness and certain Hedging Obligations_
may be designated as having super senior priority pursuant to the operation of the Intercreditor
Agreement, in which case, such super senior priority Indebtedness will receive proceeds from the
enforcement of the Security Interests in the Collateral and certain distressed disposals in priority to
Holders of the Notes pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—If the_
_Revolving Credit Facility is designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the_
_Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, creditors under the Revolving Credit_
_Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be_
_incurred under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement_
_ranking pari passu with the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid with proceeds from_
_the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in priority over the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, Topco, the Company and the Guarantors will grant security over the
Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Company’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations
under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into
by the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. When entering
into such Security Documents, the Security Agent will act in its own name, but for the benefit of the
secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders from time to time). Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Agent also acts as an agent of the lenders under the Senior Facilities and the
counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations in relation to the Security Interests created in favor
of such parties.


-----

In Germany, due to the laws and the jurisprudence governing the creation and perfection of Security
Interests, the Security Documents governed by German law will secure “parallel debt” obligations
created under the Intercreditor Agreement in favor of the Security Agent (and not the obligations under
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees). The parallel debt construct has not been fully tested under German
law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The security interests in the
_Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Senior Secured_
_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.”_

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, only the Security Agent (or, if the collateral represented by the Security Documents is held by a
creditor other than the Security Agent, that creditor) will have the right to enforce the Security
Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the Holders. As a consequence of such contractual provisions,
Holders will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes,
except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent (or such creditor) for the Collateral (as applicable). See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by Security
Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged.
However, the Security Interests with respect to the Notes and the Indenture may be released under
certain circumstances as provided under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

In the event that the Company or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations
enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to
the validity of the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement was successful, the
Holders may not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The granting of the Guarantees and security interests in_
_connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, or the incurrence of permitted debt in the_
_future, may create or restart hardening or voidance periods for such security interests in accordance_
_with the laws applicable in certain jurisdictions.”_

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” The ability to enforce_
may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the
Collateral in compliance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition, in case the 30% Rule is triggered and certain shares of the Company or the Guarantors are
transferred or issued to, and pledged by, a 30% Rule Designee, the Security Agent will be required, in
the case of an enforcement of the Collateral in respect of the Notes, to enforce such pledges separately
from the pledges provided by Topco or the relevant pledgor, over the shares of the Company and/or the
Guarantors, in order to obtain control of 100% of the share capital of the Company. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured_
_Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and such_
_Collateral may be reduced or diluted or difficult to enforce under certain circumstances.”_

The creditors under the Senior Facilities, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured by the
Collateral and the trustee of the Senior Notes have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed


-----

to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents securing such Indebtedness.

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that each Holder, by accepting such Note, will be deemed (without any
further consent of the Holders) to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are
specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and
comply with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreements and the Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any
waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

See the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—The security
_interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the_
_Senior Secured Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by_
_local law.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**_Release of Liens_**

Release of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral will be permitted under any one or more of
the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is not the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Merger and
_Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and is otherwise
not prohibited by the Indenture or (b) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided that
this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock or of accounts
receivable (including intercompany loan receivables and hedging receivables) to a Restricted
Subsidiary (except to a Securitization Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain
subject to, or otherwise become subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or
disposal;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets of, and Capital Stock issued by such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” respectively;_


-----

(5) automatically without any action by the Trustee, if the Lien granted in favor of the Indebtedness
that gave rise to the obligation to grant the Lien over such Collateral is released;

(6) in a transaction that complies with the provisions described in “—Merger and Consolidation”;
_provided that in such a transaction where the Company or any Guarantor ceases to exist, the_
Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company or such Guarantor will be released and, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, will reattach (or a new Lien will be created) over the Capital
Stock of the successor entity pursuant to a new share pledge (on terms substantially equivalent
to the existing Lien on the Capital Stock of the Company or such Guarantor, as applicable)
granted by the holder of such Capital Stock;

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(8) if the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets
of, and Capital Stock issued by, such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and the release of any assets
designated by the Company as Receivables Assets in connection with a Receivables Facility;
or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, in connection with an IPO Debt Pushdown, and (b) as may be permitted by the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes
and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or
any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security
Agent and the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and
Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of
the Security Interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons
attached, as follows:

- each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream; and

- each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.


-----

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes of a given series may be transferred to a Person who
takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes in the same series
only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to
the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the Registrar of
instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Company in compliance with applicable law, be subject
to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and described
more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any
Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without
charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any definitive registered Notes:

(1) For a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) For a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed
in part;

(3) For a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) Which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer of an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Company, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.


-----

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

On the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. However, in the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and
_Unrestricted Subsidiaries,” the Company will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth below, and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the
Notes are not redeemable at the option of the Company.

At any time prior to     , 2026, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option,
upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of the

Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

At any time on or prior to     , 2026, following the occurrence of any Initial Public Offering, the
Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—
_Selection and Notice,” with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of such_
Initial Public Offering received by the Company, including without limitation, in the case of an Initial
Public Offering by a Parent Entity, through the issuance or sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding
of the Company, as a contribution to the common equity capital of the Company, or a purchase of
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company through an issuance of Capital Stock by
the Company, at a redemption price equal to 102% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed,
_plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable_
redemption date (the “Special Redemption”).

At any time and from time to time prior to    , 2026, the Company may redeem Notes, in whole or
in part, at its option, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” with the Net Cash
Proceeds received by the Company from any Equity Offering at a redemption price equal to     % of
the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, _plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional_
Amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such
redemptions not to exceed 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including any
Additional Notes); provided that:

(1) in each case the redemption takes place not later than 180 days after the closing of the related
Equity Offering; and

(2) not less than 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (including Additional
Notes) issued under the Indenture remains outstanding immediately thereafter (unless all Notes
are redeemed substantially concurrently).

At any time and from time to time prior to     , 2026, the Company may on any one or more occasions
redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the original principal amount of the Notes (including
the original principal amount of any Additional Notes), upon notice as described under “—Selection
_and Notice,” at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the Notes so redeemed, plus_
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes redeemed and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but excluding,
the redemption date.

At any time and from time to time on or after     , 2026, the Company may redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” at a redemption price equal
to the percentage of principal amount of the Notes so redeemed set forth below plus accrued and unpaid
interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable
redemption date if redeemed during the period beginning on     , of the year indicated below:


-----

**Year** **Redemption Price**

2026 .................................................................................................................................... %
2027 .................................................................................................................................... %
2028 and thereafter ............................................................................................................. 100.000%

**_Other Redemption Terms_**
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of the Notes, including
a Change of Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if Holders
of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable outstanding Notes of such series
validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Company, or any third party
making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases, all of the Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration
date, to redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part following such
purchase at a price equal to the price offered to each other Holder of such series (excluding any early
tender or incentive fee) in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment,
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption
date. Without prejudice to any provision of the Indenture regarding Notes deemed not to be outstanding
for voting purposes if held by the Company or its Affiliates, in determining whether the Holders of at
least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of a series have validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer or
Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by the Company or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or
managed by any Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding
for the purposes of such tender offer and such determination.

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, we
may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Unless the Company defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on
the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.

**Mandatory Redemption or Sinking Fund**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to
purchase Notes as described under “—Change of Control” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock.”_

**Selection and Notice**

If fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such
other basis as they deem fair and appropriate (including the pool factor); provided, however, that no
Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount may be redeemed in part. If the Notes are
not held through Euroclear and Clearstream or Euroclear and Clearstream prescribe no method of
selection the Notes will be selected, on a pro rata basis, subject to adjustments so that no Note in an
unauthorized denomination remains outstanding after such redemption; provided, however, that no Note
of €100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Notes in integral
multiples of €1,000 shall be redeemed. The Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar shall not be
liable for selections made under this paragraph.

Notices of redemption will be delivered electronically or mailed by first-class mail at least 10 days but
not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of Notes to be redeemed at the address

of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, except that redemption notices may be delivered
electronically or mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Company’s discretion, be given prior to the
completion of a transaction (including, but not limited to, an Equity Offering, an Incurrence of
Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption may, at the Company’s
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of
a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice of redemption shall describe each such condition, and if applicable,
shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but
not more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or such redemption or purchase
may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not
have been satisfied by the redemption date (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion), or by the
redemption date as so delayed, or that such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s sole
discretion if the Company determines that any or all of such conditions will not be satisfied or waived.
In addition, the Company may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Company’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by
another Person.

The Company may redeem Notes pursuant to one or more of the relevant provisions in the Indenture,
and a single notice of redemption may be delivered with respect to redemptions made pursuant to
different provisions. Any such notice may provide that redemptions made pursuant to different
provisions will have different redemption dates.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a record date and on or before the corresponding interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid on
the redemption date to the Holder in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such
record date in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no
additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the
Company.

If and for so long as any Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
the rules of the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Authority of any such notice to the
Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Company will notify the Authority
of any change in the principal amount of Notes outstanding.

If any Definitive Registered Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates
to that Definitive Registered Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed,
in which case a portion of the original Definitive Registered Note will be issued in the name of the
Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global
Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption
notice (including any conditions contained therein), Notes called for redemption become due on the
date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Company defaults in the
payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for
redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid


-----

interest, if any, to but excluding the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “Withholding Taxes,” if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise,
if the Company determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application, administration or written interpretation
of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding, judgment or
order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice)
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to the Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if
the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Company or another Guarantor who
can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts), and such obligation cannot
be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law
must be publicly announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such
later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such
Guarantor is obliged to make at least one payment on the Notes and (b) _mutatis mutandis to any_
successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change
in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate
stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the
conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available to
it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the
laws of the relevant taxing jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional
Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on
such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor (including any successor entity)
(each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority`s
interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee is made
or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent); or


-----

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for
tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clause
(1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor
with respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price,
interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts
(the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder
in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or
deduction from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been
received by each Holder in respect of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee in the
absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder,
if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, being resident for tax purposes,
or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a
permanent establishment in or place of management present in, or being physically present in,
the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely
from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days
before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any
other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to
exemption from all or part of such Tax, but, in each case, only to the extent the Holder or
beneficial owner is legally entitled to do so;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and presentation is
required) more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment with
respect to the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Section 1471(b) of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or otherwise imposed pursuant to Sections
1471 through 1474 of the Code, in each case, as of the Issue Date (and any amended or
successor version that is substantively comparable), any regulations or agreements thereunder,
official interpretations thereof or similar law or regulation implementing an intergovernmental
agreement relating thereto;


-----

(7) any U.S. federal back-up withholding tax under Section 3406 of the Code;

(8) any Taxes imposed in Germany due to the relevant Holder being resident for tax purposes in a
non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) as set out in the
German Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von
_Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) and the respective legislative decree_
(Rechtsverordnung) as amended or replaced from time to time; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any Person other than the beneficial owner of the Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary
or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would
not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner
held such Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will provide
certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not available, certified
copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee
(with a copy to the Paying Agent). Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or
any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the
Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be
payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the
Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such
obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in
which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive
proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay and reimburse each applicable Holder for any present or future stamp, issue,
registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or
penalties with respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies
(including any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments
with respect to any Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Notes after this offering).


-----

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which
any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise
resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect
to the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee) is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision
or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Company has previously or substantially
concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as
described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes
(equal to €100,000 in principal amount or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided
that Notes of €100,000 or less in principal amount may only be redeemed in whole and not in part)
pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101%
of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if
any, to but excluding the date of repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, the Company will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control
Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by
first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in
the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering
Event and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is
delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in
the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event as described below.

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The Company may rely on any no-action letters issued by
the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a
tender offer satisfies certain conditions.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does
not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Company repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The occurrence of events which would constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control
Triggering Event may constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement that permits the Senior
Facilities lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the
Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events which would
constitute a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness
to be repurchased upon a Change of Control or a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the
exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a
default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control or the Change of Control Triggering
Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company.

The Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control
Triggering Event may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds
may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control
Triggering Event purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or
discourage a sale or takeover of us and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of


-----

Control Triggering Event purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of
the Notes and us.

Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain
transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of
Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings.
Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a_
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such
covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders
protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of
Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under
such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given
pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a
default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is
not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption
notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may
be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event. For the avoidance of doubt, a Special
Redemption following a Change of Control, with respect to a portion of the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes will not relieve the Company from the obligation to make a Change of Control Offer for
the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body
of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such
phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether
a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Company to
make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase
the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the
written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Authority so require, the Company will notify the Exchange of any Change of
Control Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants that will be contained in the Indenture. For the
avoidance of doubt, the consummation of the Transactions shall not be prohibited by the covenants
below.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

Following the first day that:

(a) the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status; and


-----

(b) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture,

then, beginning on that day and continuing until the Reversion Date (as defined below), the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the provisions of the Indenture summarized under
the following headings (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

- “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

- “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

- “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

- “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

- “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

- “—Additional Guarantees”; and

- the provisions of clause (3)(a) of the first paragraph of “—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Company.”_

If at any time the Notes cease to have such Investment Grade Status, then the Suspended Covenants
will thereafter be reinstated as if such covenants had never been suspended (the “Reversion Date”) and
will be applicable pursuant to the terms of the Indenture (including in connection with performing any
calculation or assessment to determine compliance with the terms of the Indenture), unless and until the
Notes subsequently attain Investment Grade Status (in which event the Suspended Covenants shall no
longer be in effect for such time that the Notes maintain an Investment Grade Status); _provided,_
_however, that no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the_
Notes Documents with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Company or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries shall bear any liability with respect to such Suspended Covenants for, any
actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period, or any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligation arising prior to the Reversion Date, regardless of whether such
actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect
during such period. The period of time between the date of suspension of the covenants and the
Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.”

On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the Suspension Period (other than any
Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Term Loan or the Revolving Credit Facility) will be deemed to
have been outstanding on the Issue Date so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(a) of the
second paragraph of “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” On and after the Reversion Date, all Liens created
during the Suspension Period will be considered Permitted Liens pursuant to clause (11) of such
definition. Calculations made after the Reversion Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted
Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described
under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but
not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension
Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments.” On the Reversion Date, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero._
Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into
during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is
classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate
_Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any_
action described in the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on_
the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—
_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” On and after each Reversion_
Date, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions


-----

contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and
such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

In addition, any future obligation to grant further Notes Guarantees shall be released. All such further
obligation to grant Notes Guarantees shall be reinstated upon the Reversion Date.

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain Investment Grade Status.

The Trustee shall have no duty to monitor the ratings of the Notes, shall not be deemed to have any
knowledge of the ratings of the Notes and shall have no duty to notify Holders if the Notes achieve
Investment Grade Status or upon the occurrence of the Reversion Date. The Company shall notify the
Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification shall not
be a condition for suspension of the applicable covenants to be effective.

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness) and the Company will not issue Disqualified Stock and will not
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Company
and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) and
the Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may issue Preferred
Stock, if on such date of determination and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma
application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries is at least 2.00 to 1.00.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the Incurrence by the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under any
Credit Facility (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit, guarantees and bankers’
acceptances thereunder) in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed
the sum of:

(a) the aggregate of (i) €1,800 million; plus (ii) the greater of (x) €374.2 million and (y)
70.0% of LTM EBITDA; plus

(b) an amount equal to the greater of (i) €401.0 million and (ii) 75.0% of LTM EBITDA;
_plus_

(c) the maximum amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the date of
determination, after giving _pro forma effect to such Incurrence, the Consolidated_
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
does not exceed 5.80 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness Incurred under paragraph (b)
above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio under this paragraph (c) on such date of determination but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any such subsequent
date); plus

(d) the maximum amount of Indebtedness that is secured by a Permitted Collateral Lien
but is not Senior Secured Indebtedness such that, on the date of determination, after
giving _pro forma effect to such Incurrence (and assuming for the purpose of such_
calculation that the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company
and the Restricted Subsidiaries is no less than an amount equal to the greater of the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio as of such date of determination and
5.80 to 1.00), the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and


-----

the Restricted Subsidiaries does not exceed 7.20 to 1.00 (with any Indebtedness
Incurred under clause (b) above on the date of determination of the Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio not being included in the calculation of Consolidated Total
Secured Net Leverage Ratio under this clause (d) on such date of determination but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, excluded from any such calculation made on any
subsequent date),

_provided that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any_
time if such refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of determination
for such refinancing and (II) the aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being
refinanced at such time (together with an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest
and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees,
discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing);

(2) Guarantees by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other obligations
of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or
other obligations is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Company owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) (a)(x) Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness
Incurred under the Senior Facilities or Indebtedness described in clause (3) of this paragraph)
outstanding on the Issue Date (or Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect as of the
Issue Date), after giving effect to the Transactions (as described under “Use of Proceeds” in
this Offering Memorandum) and (y) any Guarantees of the Senior Notes outstanding on the
Issue Date, (b) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes),
including any Notes Guarantee thereof, (c) Indebtedness represented by any loans pursuant to
which proceeds of any Indebtedness of a Parent Entity are lent to the Company, to the extent
that such Indebtedness is Guaranteed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or is
otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, and such
Guarantees or the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, as the case may be, are not prohibited by
the Indenture, (d) Refinancing Indebtedness (including with respect to the Notes and any
Guarantee thereof) Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause (4) and
clause (5)(b) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, and
(e) other Indebtedness Incurred to finance Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness (x) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred or issued to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of any assets) or other transaction or (y) of Persons that
are, or secured by any assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) subject to clause (3) below, in the event that all or any portion of any item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than
one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from
time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include, in any
manner that complies with this covenant, the amount and type of such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in the first paragraph above or
one of the clauses of the second paragraph of this covenant, and Indebtedness permitted by this
covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such
Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more
other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(2) with respect to clauses (5)(a), (7), (11), (13) or (19) of the second paragraph of this covenant,
if at any time that the Company would be entitled to have Incurred any then outstanding item
of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clauses (1)(c) or
(1)(d) of the second paragraph of this covenant, such item of Indebtedness shall (unless
otherwise elected by the Company) be automatically reclassified into an item of Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to clauses (1)(c) or (1)(d)
of the second paragraph of this covenant, as applicable;

(3) all Indebtedness under the Senior Term Loan Incurred or outstanding as of the Issue Date shall
be deemed to have been Incurred pursuant to clause (1)(a)(i) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, and the Company shall not be permitted to reclassify all or a portion of such
Indebtedness;

(4) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness
Incurred under a Credit Facility, re-borrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash
sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that
provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for the


-----

purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred
and not on the date of any subsequent re-borrowing thereof;

(5) in the case of any Refinancing Indebtedness, when measuring the outstanding amount of such
Indebtedness, such amount shall not include any amounts necessary to pay accrued and unpaid
interest and any fees and expenses, including any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity
fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such
refinancing;

(6) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(7) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to any
clause of the first paragraph above or the second paragraph above and the letters of credit,
bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(8) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(9) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments
under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or
commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (29) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the
Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage
Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses
(1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any) for borrowings and re-borrowings
thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will, at the Company’s option, either (a) be determined (i) on the date of such
revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full
amount thereof (or, at the option of the Company, a portion thereof) has been borrowed as of
such date) or other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (in each case, pursuant
to any letter, agreement or instrument, which may be conditional, including as to
documentation) and/or (ii) on the date on which such facility or commitments become available,
and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of
the Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing
thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of the Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or other provision of the Indenture at the time of any
borrowing or re-borrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance
and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation
of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage
of clauses (1) through (20) of the preceding paragraph (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred
and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed
pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Company may
revoke such determination at any time and from time to time;


-----

(10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (w) Incurs Indebtedness to finance an
acquisition (including an acquisition of assets) or other transaction or (x) assumes Indebtedness
of Persons that are, or secured by assets that are, acquired by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary or merged into, amalgamated or consolidated with, the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (y) commits to an acquisition or
transaction pursuant to which it may Incur Acquired Indebtedness or (z) is subject to a Change
of Control, the date of determination of LTM EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall, at the option of the Company, be (a) the date that a
definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement for such acquisition, transaction,
merger, amalgamation, consolidation or Change of Control is entered into and the LTM
EBITDA, Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio
or the Consolidated Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, shall be calculated giving
_pro forma effect to such acquisition, Change of Control and the other transactions to be entered_
into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) consistent with the definition of the LTM EBITDA, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Total Secured Net
Leverage Ratio, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, (A) if any such ratios are
exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such ratio (including due to fluctuations in the
Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target company) at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant acquisition or Change of Control, such ratios will not be deemed to have been
exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether such
acquisition and any related transactions are permitted hereunder and (B) such ratios shall not
be tested at the time of consummation of such acquisition, transaction, merger, amalgamation
or consolidation; provided that if the Company elects to have such determinations occur at the
time of entry into such definitive agreement, put option or similar arrangement, (i) any such
transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreement, put option
or similar arrangement is entered into and to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of
calculating any ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the earlier
of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or
expires without consummation of such acquisition and (ii) to the extent any covenant baskets
were utilized in satisfying any covenants, such baskets shall be deemed utilized until the earlier
of the date of consummation of such acquisition or the date such agreement is terminated or
expires without consummation of such acquisition, but any calculation of LTM EBITDA or
Consolidated EBITDA for purposes of other Incurrences of Indebtedness or Liens or making
of Restricted Payments (not related to such acquisition) shall not reflect such acquisition until
it has been consummated, unless such other Incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens is conditional
or contingent on the occurrence of such acquisition or Change of Control or (b) the date such
Indebtedness is borrowed or assumed or such Change of Control occurs;

(11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time
of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to
be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such
refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded
so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal
amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus premiums (including tender premiums),
defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such refinancing; and

(12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will
be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual and/or capitalization of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional


-----

Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or
Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness
due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the
covenant described under the heading “—Limitation on Indebtedness”; provided that the amount of any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of any outstanding Indebtedness may (in the Company’s sole
discretion) be increased by the amount of all such accrued and/or capitalized interest, accreted value,
original issue discount and/or additional Indebtedness in respect of such Indebtedness and such
increased amount will not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket,
permission or threshold under which such Refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under the
heading “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company shall be in default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any Euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency
shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness
was first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Euro equivalent); provided that for
the purpose of the Incurrence of any other Indebtedness, the Company may elect to account for any
such Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect
on the determination date for the Incurrence of such other Indebtedness; further provided that if such
Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such
refinancing would cause the applicable Euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Euro-denominated
restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (x) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
refinanced plus (y) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and unpaid interest,
premiums (including tender premiums) and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount,
upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

to sub-clauses (ii) or (iii) of the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent the purpose of the
receipt of such cash, property or assets or marketable securities was used to reduce the Consolidated
Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and as a result thereof a Change of Control Triggering Event
that would otherwise have occurred without the receipt of such cash, property or assets or marketable
securities did not occur.

(1) the payment of any dividend or distribution within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof,
if at the date of declaration such payment would have complied with the provisions of the
Indenture, or the redemption, repurchase or retirement of Indebtedness if, at the date of any

the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market value of property or assets or of
marketable securities, from such sale of Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock or
such contribution will be excluded from clause (c) of the preceding paragraph and (b) if
immediately prior to the retirement of Treasury Capital Stock, the declaration and payment of
dividends thereon was permitted under clause (13) of this paragraph, the declaration and

not be paid to Topco or any such Parent Entity in cash, but instead will be converted into an
intercompany loan made by Topco or any such Parent Entity to the Company which constitutes
Subordinated Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) (i) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described
in clauses (1) through (23) above, and/or (ii) is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
and/or (iii) constitutes a Permitted Investment, the Company will be entitled to classify such Restricted
Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on
circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or
portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as a Permitted Investment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment. The
fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment, property or assets other than cash shall be determined conclusively
by the Company acting in good faith.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries
in a Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or
otherwise acquire Indebtedness or Capital Stock of the Company, any Parent Entity or any of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any
Parent Entity and to Affiliates thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to
be a “direct or indirect” action by the Company or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Company will not, and the Company will procure that no Restricted Subsidiary or Topco will,
directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets
(including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of Topco, only to the extent that
such property or assets constitute Collateral), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that
date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness
(such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute
Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the
Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that
constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Indenture under (a)(2) in the
preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the
release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under the


-----

Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and/or under the
relevant Security Document.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the
time of the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased
Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase
in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted
value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference and
increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange
rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create or otherwise cause or
permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability
of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) make any loans or advances to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(3) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior
Facilities), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (c)
any other agreement or instrument; in each case, in effect at or entered into on the Issue Date;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to the Indenture, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the
Security Documents or the Senior Notes;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to applicable law, rule, regulation or order;

(4) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person or relating
to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which
such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on
which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred
as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was acquired by the Company or was merged, consolidated or otherwise
combined with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or entered into in
contemplation of or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date;
_provided that, for the purposes of this clause, if another Person is the Successor Company (as_
defined below), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such


-----

Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
when such Person becomes the Successor Company;

(5) any encumbrance, restriction or condition:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract or agreement, or
the assignment or transfer of any lease, license or other contract or agreement;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges, charges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict
the transfer or encumbrance of the property or assets subject to such mortgages,
pledges, charges or other security agreements;

(c) contained in any trading, netting, operating, construction, service, supply, purchase,
sale or other agreement to which the Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries is
a party entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;
_provided that such agreement prohibits the encumbrance of solely the property or assets_
of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary that are the subject to such agreement,
the payment rights arising thereunder or the proceeds thereof and does not extend to
any other asset or property of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary or the assets
or property of another Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired;

indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such
restriction) pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(8) customary provisions in leases, licenses, shareholder agreements, joint venture agreements and
other similar agreements, organizational documents and instruments;

(9) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation, licensing requirement or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past
practice;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Hedging Obligations;

(12) restrictions created in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing or Receivables
Facility that, in the good faith determination of the Company, are necessary or advisable to
effect such Securitization Facility or Receivables Facility;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if the encumbrances


-----

and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not
materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a whole) than (i) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in (A) the Senior Facilities Agreement, (B) the Security Documents, and
(C) the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (ii) as is
customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Company) and where,
in the case of this sub-clause (ii), either (x) the Company determines at the time of entry into
such agreement or instrument that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect,
in any material respect, the Company’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the
Notes or (y) such encumbrance or restriction applies only during the continuance of a default
relating to such agreement or instrument, or (b) constituting an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(14) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens”; or_

of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument
referred to in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (15) (an “Initial Agreement”)
or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to
in clauses (1) to (14) of this paragraph or this clause (15); _provided,_ _however, that the_
encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such
agreement or instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders (taken as
a whole) than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial
Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates
(as determined in good faith by the Company).

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset
Disposition unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any
liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value
to be determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined
in good faith by the Company, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap or relates to Non-Core Assets), with a purchase
price in excess of the greater of (x) €53.5 million and (y) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA, at least 75%
of the consideration from such Asset Disposition (including by way of relief from, or by any
other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) received by

Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments; provided that this clause (2) shall not apply to the
first amount of consideration from such Asset Dispositions per fiscal year not to exceed the
greater of (x) €80.2 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied:

(a) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or
is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), (i) to prepay, repay or purchase any
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (in each case, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) or any Senior
Secured Indebtedness or any Indebtedness secured by a Lien on property or assets of


-----

the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Permitted Collateral Liens)
within 450 days from the later of (1) the date of such Asset Disposition and (2) receipt
of such Net Available Cash; _provided,_ _however, that, in connection with any_
prepayment, repayment or repurchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause
the related commitment (if any) to be reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased, _provided, further_ that to the extent the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary has elected to prepay, repay or purchase any
amount of Senior Secured Indebtedness at a price not less than par and has extended
such offer to the Holders on at least a pro rata basis, to the extent the creditors in respect
of such Senior Secured Indebtedness (including any Holders) elect not to tender their
Senior Secured Indebtedness for such prepayment, repayment or purchase, the
Company will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Available Cash equal to
such amount not tendered under this paragraph (a), and such amount shall not increase
the amount of Excess Proceeds; or (ii) to redeem or purchase Notes;

(b) to the extent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit
to invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional
Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary equal to the amount of Net Available Cash received
by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) within 450 days from the later of (i)
the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash;
_provided, however, that a binding agreement shall be treated as a permitted application_
of Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment with the good faith
expectation that an amount equal to Net Available Cash will be applied to satisfy such
commitment within 180 days of such commitment (an “Acceptable Commitment”)
and, in the event any Acceptable Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any
reason before such amount is applied, then such Net Available Cash shall constitute
Excess Proceeds,

_provided further that, pending the final application of the amount of any such Net Available Cash in_
accordance with clause (a) or (b) above, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily
reduce Indebtedness or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the
Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that (x) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available
Cash of any Asset Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the
extent necessary to comply with this covenant) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law
(including financial assistance and corporate benefit restrictions and fiduciary and statutory duties of
the relevant directors) or (y) a distribution of any or all of the Net Available Cash of any Asset
Disposition by a Subsidiary to the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary (to the extent necessary
to comply with this covenant) could result in material adverse Tax consequences, as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required
to be applied in compliance with this covenant.

The amount of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the first paragraph of this covenant will be deemed
to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture; _provided_ that, if at the time of any definitive
agreement, put option or similar arrangement in respect of any Asset Disposition or (at the option of
the Company) the date on which Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition is received, the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries is no
greater than 4.55 to 1.00, 50% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition shall be deemed
not to constitute Excess Proceeds and may be used by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
for any purpose not prohibited by the Indenture. On the 451st day (or such longer period permitted by
clause (3)(b) of the first paragraph of this covenant) after the later of an Asset Disposition or the receipt
of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds under the Indenture exceeds


-----

the greater of €133.7 million and 25.0% of LTM EBITDA, the Company will within 10 Business Days
be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders under the Indenture and, to the
extent the Company elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari passu Indebtedness, to repay, prepay
or purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari passu Indebtedness
to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be repaid, prepaid or purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes (and, in the case of any Pari passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than 100% of
the principal amount of such Pari passu Indebtedness), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but not including, the date of repayment, prepayment or purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari passu Indebtedness, as
applicable, and with respect to the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Company will deliver notice of such Asset Disposition Offer
electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and each Holder at
the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, describing the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Asset Disposition and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price
on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days
from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and
described in such notice. The Company may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net
Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to all Net
Available Cash prior to the expiration of the relevant 450 days (or such longer period as provided above)
or with respect to any unapplied Excess Proceeds.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset
Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders,
collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Company shall allocate the Excess Proceeds
among the Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness to be repaid, prepaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on
the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari passu Indebtedness provided that
the Company shall not be required to select and purchase Notes or other Pari passu Indebtedness in an
unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than Euro, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net
amount of funds in Euro that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into
Euros.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of
the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company
or a Guarantor) and the release of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability
on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
from the transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Company and each other Restricted Subsidiary


-----

are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Company (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together
with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant during
the same fiscal year, not to exceed the greater of (a) €133.7 million and (b) 25.0% of LTM
EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being
measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the
Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the
applicable securities laws, rules and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations
described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Indenture to the contrary, the provisions of the Indenture
relative to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset
Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the Notes then outstanding.

The Senior Facilities may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Company becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Company from purchasing any Notes pursuant
to this covenant. In the event the Company is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Company could
seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings
that contain such prohibition. If the Company does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings,
it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes under such instruments.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into or conduct any
transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Company (any such transaction or
series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of
the greater of (i) €53.5 million and (ii) 10.0% of LTM EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained
in a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is not such an
Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
(a) €80.2 million and (b) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA, the terms of such Affiliate Transaction have
been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2)
above if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors of the
Company, if any.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:


-----

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” or any Permitted Investment;_

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding
of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or
benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and
other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock
of the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent Entity, restricted stock plans, longterm incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee
benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities
provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with
past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any (a) transaction between or among the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity
that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries and (b) merger, amalgamation or consolidation with any Parent Entity,
_provided that such Parent Entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets other_
than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Company and such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise permitted under the Indenture;

(5) the payment of compensation, fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension
expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or
employees of the Company, any Parent Entity or any Restricted Subsidiary (whether directly
or indirectly and including through any Controlled Investment Affiliate of such directors,
officers, contractors, consultants, distributors or employees);

(6) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant to or
for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended,
renewed or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or
to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders (taken as a whole) in any material respect;

(7) any transaction with a Securitization Subsidiary effected as part of a Qualified Securitization
Financing or Receivables Facility, any disposition or repurchase of Securitization Assets,
Receivables Assets or related assets in connection with any Qualified Securitization Financing
or Receivables Facility;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, joint venture partners, suppliers, contractors, distributors
or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors of the Company or the
senior management of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no
less favorable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an
unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Company or an Associate or similar entity which
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely (i) because the Company or a Restricted


-----

Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any
Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or
similar entity or (ii) due to the fact that a director of such Person is also a director of the
Company or any direct or indirect Parent Entity of the Company (provided, however, that such
director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or such direct or indirect Parent
Entity of the Company, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person);

(10) any (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated
Preferred Stock) of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital
Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding and the granting of registration and other
customary rights (and the performance of the related obligations) in connection therewith or
any contribution to capital of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and (b) amendment,
waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in
compliance with the other provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; _provided that such Subordinated_
Shareholder Funding, as amended or otherwise modified, will continue to satisfy the
requirements described in the definition of “Subordinated Shareholder Funding”;

(11) (a) any payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly), including to its affiliates or its designees, of annual
management, consulting, monitoring, refinancing, transaction, subsequent transaction exit fees,
advisory fees and related costs and reasonable expenses and indemnities in connection
therewith and any termination fees (including any such cash lump sum or present value fee
upon the consummation of a corporate event, including an Initial Public Offering) and (b) any
customary payments by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder
(whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent Entity) for financial advisory,
financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking
activities, including in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which are in the case of
each of clauses (a) and (b) approved by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Company in
good faith;

(12) payment to any Permitted Holder of all out of pocket expenses incurred by such Permitted
Holder in connection with its direct or indirect investment in the Company and its Subsidiaries;

other professional fees and expenses) related to the Transactions;

(14) transactions in which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, delivers
to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is
fair to the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the
requirements of clause (1) of the preceding paragraph;

(15) the existence of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its
obligations under the terms of, any equityholders agreement (including any registration rights
agreement or purchase agreements related thereto) to which it is party as of the Issue Date, and
any similar agreement that it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence
of, or the performance by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of its obligations under
any future amendment to the equityholders’ agreement or under any similar agreement entered
into after the Issue Date will only be permitted under this clause to the extent that the terms of
any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous to the Holders (taken
as a whole) in any material respect as determined in good faith by the Company;

(16) any purchases by the Company’s Affiliates of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock of the
Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries the majority of which Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock is purchased by Persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates; provided


-----

that such purchases by the Company’s Affiliates are on the same terms as such purchases by
such Persons who are not the Company’s Affiliates;

(17) any (a) Investments by Affiliates in securities of the Company or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries (and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Incurred by such Affiliates in
connection therewith) so long as the Investment is being offered by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary generally to other non-affiliated third party investors on the same or more
favorable terms; (b) payments to Affiliates in respect of securities of the Company or any of

accordance with the terms of such securities; and (c) payments by any Parent Entity, the
Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to any tax sharing agreements or other

to any management equity plan or stock option plan or any other management or employee

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company may designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary and any
Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary, in each case, if that designation would not cause
a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate fair
market value of all outstanding Investments owned by the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries in
the Subsidiary designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be deemed to be an Investment made as of
the time of the designation and will reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” or under one or more clauses of
the definition of Permitted Investments, as determined by the Company. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if the Restricted Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

If, at any time, any Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the
Indenture and any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary will be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted
Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under
the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Company will be in default of such
covenant.

If an Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated as a Restricted Subsidiary, that designation will be deemed
to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is
permitted under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” (including pursuant to
clause (5) of the second paragraph thereof, treating such designation as an acquisition for the purpose
of such clause), calculated on a pro forma basis as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of
the Relevant Testing Period; and (2) no Default or Event of Default would be in existence immediately
following such designation. Any such designation by the Company or the re-designation of an
Unrestricted Subsidiary to a Restricted Subsidiary as contemplated hereby shall be evidenced to the
Trustee on the date of such designation or re-designation by filing with the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate certifying that such designation or re-designation complies with the preceding conditions.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Trustee the following reports
following the Issue Date:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the Issue Date,
annual reports (the “Annual Financial Statements”), containing: (i) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as at the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Company for the most recent
two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the
end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;
(ii) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion
of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Company; (iii) unaudited pro forma income statement and
balance sheet information of the Company, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning
of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such
_pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3)_


-----

below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in
the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iv) a brief description of
the business, management and shareholders of the Company, all material affiliate transactions
and a description of all material debt instruments; provided that the information described in
clause (iv) may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of
the Company, beginning with the first quarter ending March 31, 2024, quarterly year-to-date
financial statements (the “Quarterly Financial Statements”) containing the following
information: (i) the Company’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end
of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent
quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the
comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (ii) unaudited pro forma
income statement and balance sheet information of the Company, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report
relates; provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense or burden, in which case the Company will provide, in
the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; and (iii) an operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations, EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources of the Company; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Company announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a change in a senior executive
officer of the Company or a change in auditors of the Company, a report containing a
description of such event.

In addition, the Company shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of
such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
“affiliates” under the Securities Act.

All financial statement information (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the calculations made under
any incurrence covenant, which shall be prepared in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) shall
be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or
otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a consistent basis for the periods presented,
except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth
in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis
that applied to such periods. No report need include separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries
of the Company or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or
statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set
forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to GAAP.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Company’s LTM EBITDA
(calculated (i) in the case of an acquisition, including any pro forma adjustments in respect of such
acquisition and (ii) in the case of a disposal, excluding any pro forma adjustments in respect of such
disposal) for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been
delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant


-----

Subsidiary of the Company, then the Annual Financial Statements and Quarterly Financial Statements
will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the
footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Company.

In the event that (i) the Company becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file
the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Company elects to provide to the Trustee
reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Company) the
reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long
as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents
and other reports that the Company is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such
Section 13(a) or 15(d).

All reports provided pursuant to this “—Reports” covenant shall be in English, or with a certified
English translation.

Subject to compliance with the next succeeding paragraph, in the event that, and for so long as, the
equity securities of the Company or any Parent Entity or IPO Entity are listed on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange (or one or more of the equivalent regulated markets of Euronext, the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Stockholm Stock Exchange, the Irish Stock Exchange, the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange, the Swiss Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange) (each a “Regulated
Market”) and the Company or such Parent Entity or IPO Entity is subject to the admission and disclosure
standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on a Regulated Market, for so
long as it elects, the Company will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information,
documents and other reports that the Company, such Parent Entity or such IPO Entity is, or would be,
required to file with the applicable Regulated Market pursuant to such admission and disclosure
standards. Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and provided that such requirements
require the Company, any Parent Entity or IPO Entity to prepare and file annual reports, information,
documents and other reports with the applicable Regulated Market, the Company will be deemed to
have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

The Company may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements under this
covenant by providing any report or financial statements of a direct or indirect Parent Entity of the
Company so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet the requirements
(including as to content and time of delivery) of this covenant as if references to the Company therein
were references to such Parent Entity and (b) are accompanied by condensed consolidated financial
information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Entity; (ii) the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of any applicable Parent Entity
that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating
adjustments; and (v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be required to be audited. Upon
complying with the foregoing requirement, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. For the avoidance of doubt, only Indebtedness of the
Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be taken into account when making any calculations
required under the Indenture.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this section is for
information purposes and the Trustee’s receipt shall not constitute constructive notice of any
information contained therein, including the Company’s compliance with any of its covenants under
Indenture.


-----

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company will not, and will procure that no Restricted Subsidiary or Topco will, take or knowingly
or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair
the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the Holders, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary or Topco to,
grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Security Agent and
the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral,
except that (i) the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco may amend, extend, renew, restate,
supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of
Incurring Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco may
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization, (iii) the Collateral may be
discharged and released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security
Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error
or inconsistency therein and (v) the Company, the Restricted Subsidiaries and Topco may amend the
Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect Holders in any material respect;
_provided, however, that in the case of clause (i), (ii) and (v) above, the Security Documents may not be_
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or otherwise modified or replaced,
unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a
solvency opinion, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial
Advisor confirming the solvency of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (or, in the case
of any relevant action with respect to Security Documents to which Topco is party as a security grantor,
confirming the solvency of Topco), after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from
the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such
Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to
such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise
subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement. In the event that the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or Topco
complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to
customary protections and indemnifications) consent to any amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release or other modification or replacement requested in accordance with this
covenant without the need for instructions from any Holder.

**_Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities, any
Credit Facility or any Public Debt, in each case of the Company or a Guarantor, unless such Restricted
Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor on the date on which the Guarantee of such other Indebtedness is
Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially
in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes
Guarantee, which Notes Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with, as applicable, such Restricted
Subsidiary’s Guarantee of such other Indebtedness; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be obligated to become a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such
Notes Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could give rise to or result in: (1) any


-----

breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership)
shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket
expenses. At the option of the Company, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on Guarantor
liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees—Notes Guarantee Release.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all_
necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, reasonably requested by, and at the cost of, the Company to
effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital_
_maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the_
_validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Security Interests and Guarantees and Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”_

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Company, in connection with the Incurrence by
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of (x) any Indebtedness secured on Collateral or as
otherwise required herein and (y) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to
in the foregoing clause (x), the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the
Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement,
amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders (taken as a
whole)), including substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees and priority
and release of the Security Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities
of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the
Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any
time, the correlative terms of such intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Company and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or
types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes
(including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to


-----

secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, (8) make
any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders (taken as a whole)
in any material respect or (9) make all necessary provisions to ensure that the Notes are secured by the
relevant Liens over the Collateral. The Company shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and
the Company may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or,
in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights,
duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**_Financial Calculations_**

Any amounts incurred on the basis of any basket, test or permission where an element is set by reference
to a percentage of LTM EBITDA (“EBITDA based basket”) shall (provided that such amounts are, at
the time of incurrence, duly and properly incurred in accordance with the relevant basket, test or
permission) be treated as having been duly and properly incurred without the occurrence of an Event of
Default even in the event that such LTM EBITDA basket subsequently decreases by virtue of operation
of that calculation.

Subject to clause (3) under the third paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness,” in the event that any amount or transaction meets the criteria of more than one of the_
baskets or exceptions set out in the Indenture, the Company, in its sole discretion, will classify and may
from time to time reclassify that amount or transaction to a particular basket or exception and will only
be required to include that amount or transaction in one of those baskets or exceptions (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, an amount or transaction may at the option of the Company be split between
different baskets or exceptions).

Any reference in the Indenture to an Applicable Metric shall be deemed to be a reference to such
Applicable Metric as determined at the Applicable Test Date.

For any relevant basket set by reference to a financial year, fiscal year or calendar year (each an “Annual
Period”): (i) at the option of the Company, the maximum amount so permitted under such basket during
such Annual Period may be increased by: (A) an amount equal to 100% of the difference (if positive)
between the permitted amount in the immediately preceding Annual Period and the amount thereof
actually used or applied by the Group during such preceding Annual Period (the “Carry Forward
Amount”); and/or (B) an amount equal to 100% of the permitted amount in the immediately following
Annual Period and the permitted amount in such immediately following Annual Period shall be reduced


-----

by such corresponding amount (the “Carry Back Amount”); and (ii) to the extent that the maximum
amount so permitted under such basket during such Annual Period is increased in accordance with
paragraph (i), any usage of such basket during such Annual Period shall be deemed to be applied in the
following order: (A) firstly against the Carry Forward Amount; (B) secondly against the maximum
amount so permitted during such Annual Period prior to any increase in accordance with paragraph (i)
above; and (C) thirdly against the Carry Back Amount.

To the extent that any Indebtedness not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture satisfies any Applicable
Metric or other condition (pro forma for its incurrence) on the Applicable Test Date, such condition is
deemed to have been satisfied, including on the date of its incurrence and irrespective of any facts or
circumstances (including financial condition) thereafter.

For the purpose of calculating any Applicable Metric (including the financial definitions or components
thereof):

(1) when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant
Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Purchase (as
defined below)), the Company may: (A) if during such period any member of the Group (by
merger or otherwise) has made or committed to make an Investment in any person that thereby
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or otherwise has acquired or committed to acquire any entity,
business, property or material fixed asset (including the acquisition, opening and/or
development of any new site or operation) (any such Investment, acquisition or commitment
therefor, a “Purchase”), including any such Purchase occurring in connection with a transaction
causing a calculation to be made under the Indenture, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for such
period on the basis that the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
(calculated on the same basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) attributable to the
assets which are the subject of such Purchase during such Relevant Testing Period as if the
Purchase occurred on the first day of such Relevant Testing Period; and/or (B) include an
adjustment in respect of any Purchase up to the amount of the pro forma increase in
Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into account the
full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives which the Company believes can be achieved from
the date of the Purchase to the date falling 24 months following the date of completion of the
Purchase (or if later, the last day of the applicable Relevant Testing Period) directly or indirectly
as a result of the Purchase or the related steps, provided that so long as such synergies, cost
savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives will
be realizable at any time during such period, it may be assumed they will be realizable during
the entire such period without prejudice to the synergies, cost savings, operating expense
reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives actually realized during the
Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA (the “Pro Forma
Acquisition Cost Savings”) (provided that when calculating such Pro Forma Acquisition Cost
Savings in respect of a Purchase which any member of the Group has committed or expects to
make, such Pro Forma Acquisition Costs Savings shall not be taken into account for the
purposes of calculating any ratio or related usage or permission for the purposes of making a
dividend or distribution to the Initial Investors until such Purchase has been consummated by
the relevant member of the Group); and/or (C) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs and
expenses directly or indirectly related to the Purchase; and/or

(2) when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant
Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to any relevant Sale (as defined
below)), the Company may: (A) if during such period any member of the Group has disposed
or committed to make a disposal of any Sold Entity or Business (any such sale, transfer,
disposition or commitment therefor, a “Sale”) or if the transaction giving rise to the need to
calculate Consolidated EBITDA relates to such a Sale, calculate Consolidated EBITDA for
such period on the basis that Consolidated EBITDA will be reduced by an amount equal to the


-----

earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the same
basis as Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if positive) attributable to the assets which
are the subject of such Sale for such period or increased by an amount equal to the earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and impairment (calculated on the same basis as
Consolidated EBITDA, mutatis mutandis) (if negative) attributable thereto for such period as
if the Sale occurred on the first day of such Relevant Testing Period, _provided_ _that if the_
Company elects to make such an adjustment and the relevant sale constitutes “discontinued
operations” in accordance with IFRS, Consolidated Net Income shall be reduced by an amount
equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if positive) attributable to such operations for such
period or increased by an amount equal to the Consolidated Net Income (if negative)
attributable thereto for such period; and/or (B) include an adjustment in respect of any Sale up
to the amount of the pro forma increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Company
(in good faith) after taking into account the full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings,
operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives which
Company believes can be achieved from the date of the Sale to the date falling 24 months
following the date of completion of the Sale (or if later, the last day of the applicable Relevant
Testing Period) directly or indirectly as a consequence of the Sale, or the related steps, provided
that so long as such synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating
improvements or other similar initiatives will be realizable at any time during such period, it
may be assumed they will be realizable during the entire such period without prejudice to the
synergies, cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives actually realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already included in
Consolidated EBITDA (the “Pro Forma Disposal Cost Savings”); and/or (C) exclude any nonrecurring fees, costs and expenses directly or indirectly related to the Sale; and/or

(3) when determining (or, as applicable, forecasting) Consolidated EBITDA for any Relevant
Testing Period (including the portion thereof occurring prior to implementing or committing to
implement such Group Initiative (as defined below)), the Company may: (A) include an
adjustment in respect of any action or step (including any restructuring, reorganization, new or
revised contract or other similar initiative) taken or committed to be taken by the Group during
such Relevant Testing Period (each a “Group Initiative”) up to the amount of the pro forma
increase in Consolidated EBITDA projected by the Company (in good faith) after taking into
account the full run rate effect of all synergies, cost savings, revenues, operating expense
reductions, operating improvements or other adjustments or similar initiatives which the
Company believes can be achieved from the date of the Group Initiative to the date falling 24
months following the date of completion of the Group Initiative (or if later, the last day of the
applicable Relevant Testing Period) directly or indirectly as a result of implementing or
committing to implement such Group Initiative, provided that so long as such synergies, cost
savings, revenues, operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar
initiatives will be realizable at any time during such period, it may be assumed they will be
realizable during the entire period without prejudice to the synergies, cost savings, revenues,
operating expense reductions, operating improvements or other similar initiatives actually
realized during the Relevant Testing Period and already included in Consolidated EBITDA (the
“Pro Forma Group Initiative Cost Savings”); and/or (B) exclude any non-recurring fees, costs
and expenses directly or indirectly related to the implementation of, or commitment to,
implement such Group Initiative,

_provided that where Pro Forma Cost Savings are included in any calculation in respect of any Purchase,_
Sale or Group Initiative, the aggregate amount of projected (but not realized) Pro Forma Cost Savings
that may be included in any Relevant Testing Period may not exceed 25% of Consolidated EBITDA
for such period (calculated after fully taking into account any adjustments to be made by the Company
pursuant to this paragraph).


-----

Unless a contrary indication appears, a reference in the Indenture to Consolidated EBITDA or
Consolidated Net Income is to be construed as a reference to the Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated
Net Income of the Group on a consolidated basis.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary (including anything in the financial definitions set out in the
Indenture), when calculating any Applicable Metric, the financial definitions or component thereof) the
Company shall be permitted to: (i) exclude all or any part of any expenditure or other negative item
(and/or the impact thereof) directly or indirectly relating to or resulting from: (A) the Acquisition; (B)
any acquisition, Investment or other joint venture not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture or the
impact from purchase price accounting; (C) start-up costs for new businesses and branding or rebranding of existing businesses; (D) Restructuring Costs; and/or (E) the implementation of IFRS 15
(Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and any successor standard thereto (or any equivalent
measure); and/or (ii) include any addbacks for adjustments (including anticipated synergies) or costs or
expenses taken into account in determining the “Run-Rate Adjusted EBITDA” included in this Offering
Memorandum.

**Merger and Consolidation**

**_The Company_**

The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of England and Wales. Germany, any member state of
the European Union, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the
District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the
Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume, by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Company under the Notes and
the Indenture and all obligations of the Company under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the applicable Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the applicable
Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the applicable
Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default has occurred
and is continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Company or the applicable
Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant
to the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company and the Restricted_
Subsidiaries would not be lower than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such
transaction;

(4) the Company or the Successor Company, as the case may be, shall have delivered to the Trustee
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation,
merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (in the case of a Successor Company)
comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (in the case of a Successor Company) is a legal and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Company, provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may
rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact, including as to satisfaction of clauses
(1), (2) and (3) above; and


-----

(5) the Holders (or the Security Agent on their behalf) will continue to have the same or
substantially equivalent (ignoring for the purposes of assessing such equivalency any
limitations required in accordance with the Agreed Security Principles or hardening periods)
guarantees and security over the same or substantially equivalent assets and over the shares (or
other interests) in the Company or the Successor Company, save to the extent such assets or
shares (or other interests) cease to exist (provided that if the shares (or other interests) in the
Company cease to exist, security will be granted (subject to the Agreed Security Principles)
over the shares (or other interests) in the Successor Company).

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Company under the Notes and the Indenture.

**_Guarantors_**

No Guarantor may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person; or

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or dispose of, all or substantially all its assets, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into such Guarantor, unless:

(a) the other Person is the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such transaction;

(b) (1) either (x) the Company or a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor
under its Notes Guarantee and the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default has occurred and is
continuing; or

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation
or merger) of the Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets
of the Guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

The provisions set forth in this “—Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Company, a
Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor from merging
or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Company or another
Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company into any Guarantor; provided that (A) if
the Company is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will
assume the obligations of the Company under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1), (4) and (5) under
the heading “—The Company” shall apply to such transaction; or (iv) the Company or any Guarantor
consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose
of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or
changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2), (4) and (5) under the
heading “—The Company” or clause (3) under this heading “—Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall
apply to any such transaction.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to the creation of a new Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.


-----

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note when due at
its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or
otherwise;

(3) failure by the Company or any Guarantor to comply for 60 days after written notice by the
Trustee on behalf of the Holders or by the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes with any agreement or obligation contained in the Indenture, other
than those set out in clauses (1) or (2) above;

(4) the occurrence of any default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there
may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed which is Incurred or Guaranteed by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary, other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, which:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness, at its stated final maturity
(after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) provided in such Indebtedness (a
“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its stated final maturity (the
“cross acceleration provision”),

and, in each case, the aggregate principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default
of principal at its stated final maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) or
the maturity of which has been accelerated, is in excess of the greater of (x) €160.4 million and
(y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Company, Topco or a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Company or a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess
of the greater of (x) €160.4 million and (y) 30.0% of LTM EBITDA, other than any judgments
covered by indemnities provided by, or insurance policies issued by, reputable and creditworthy
companies, which final judgments remain unpaid, undischarged and unstayed for a period of
more than 60 days (after receipt of notice as described in the next succeeding paragraph) after
such judgment becomes final, and in the event such judgment is covered by insurance, an
enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or decree
which is not promptly stayed (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any Security Interest under the Security Documents having a fair market value in excess of the
greater of (x) €80.2 million and (y) 15.0% of LTM EBITDA shall, at any time, cease to be in
full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of
any such Security Interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such


-----

Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 30 days (the “security default provisions”);
and

(8) except as permitted under the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (including with respect to any limitations), any Notes Guarantee of
one or more Guarantors that together constitute a Significant Subsidiary (a “Significant
Guarantor”) is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any
reason to be in full force and effect, or is denied or disaffirmed by such Significant Guarantor
or any Person acting on behalf of it (the “guarantee default provisions”).

If any Event of Default (other than of a type specified in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing
under the Indenture, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of not less than 30%
in aggregate principal amount of all the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and
the Trustee, may, and the Trustee (subject to certain conditions) at the request of such Holders shall,
declare the principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the then outstanding Notes to be due
and payable immediately, and upon such declaration, such principal, accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
will be due and payable immediately; provided, however, that a Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7)
or (8) of the first paragraph of this section will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or
the Holders of 30% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes notify the Company of the Default
and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clauses after receipt of
such notice. Any notice of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this
section, notice of acceleration with respect to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8)
of the first paragraph of this section or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default under
clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section, notice of acceleration with respect
to an Event of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section or take
any other action under paragraphs two to five of this section with respect to an alleged Default or Event
of Default under clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this section (a “Noteholder
Direction”), in each case, provided by any one or more Holders (each, a “Directing Holder”) must be
accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Company and the Trustee that
such Holder is not, or, in the case such Holder is Euroclear or Clearstream (as applicable, the “Relevant
Clearing System”) or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee, that such Holder is being instructed
solely by beneficial owners that are not, Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation,
in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times
until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated. In
any case in which the Holder is the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s
nominee or any Position Representation required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner
of the Notes in lieu of the Relevant Clearing System or the Relevant Clearing System’s nominee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Company
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any
relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and the Company provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate certifying that the Company (i) believes in good faith that there is a reasonable
basis to believe a Directing Holder was at any relevant time in breach of its Position Representation and
that, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining
Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such
Noteholder Direction (assuming, for this purpose only, that such Notes of such Directing Holder would
be deemed not to be outstanding), and (ii) has filed papers with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking
a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation,
and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction
based on such alleged breach, the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be
automatically stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction on such matter. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in the Notes held or
beneficially owned by such Directing Holder being deemed not to be outstanding for purposes of such


-----

Noteholder Direction; and, if, without the participation of such Directing Holder, the percentage of
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab
initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred and any
acceleration based solely on such voided Noteholder Direction rescinded, and the Trustee shall be
deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such alleged Default or Event
of Default based solely on such voided Noteholder Direction, shall not be permitted to act thereon and
shall be restricted from accepting and acting on any future Noteholder Direction provided by the same
Directing Holder in relation to such Event of Default. No such rescission shall affect any other or
subsequent Default or impair any right consequent thereto. Notwithstanding the above, if such Directing
Holder’s participation is not required to achieve the requisite level of consent of Holders required under
the Indenture to give such Noteholder Direction, the Trustee shall be permitted to act in accordance
with such Noteholder Direction notwithstanding any action taken or to be taken by the Company (as
described above). The Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction or
Officer’s Certificate delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture without verification, investigation
or otherwise as to the statements made therein.

Each Holder by accepting a Note acknowledges and agrees that the Trustee (and any agent) shall not
be liable to any party for acting or refraining to act in accordance with (i) the foregoing provisions, (ii)
any Noteholder Direction, (iii) any Officer’s Certificate or (iv) its duties under the Indenture, as the
Trustee (or any agent) may determine in its sole discretion. The Trustee shall have no obligation (i) to
monitor, investigate, verify or otherwise determine if a Holder (or beneficial owner, as the case may
be) has Net Short position, (ii) investigate the accuracy or authenticity of any Position Representation,
(iii) inquire if the Company will seek action to determine if a Directing Holder has breached its Position
Representation, (iv) monitor any court proceedings undertaken in connection therewith, (v) monitor or
investigate whether any Default or Event of Default has been publicly reported or (vi) otherwise make
any calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to any Derivative Instruments, Net Short
position, Long Derivative Instrument, Short Derivative Instrument or otherwise.

Upon the effectiveness of such declaration, or in the case of clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, upon a valid Noteholder Direction to accelerate the Notes, such principal
and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding any of
the foregoing, in the case of an Event of Default arising under clause (5) of the first paragraph of this
section, all outstanding Notes (including the accrued and unpaid interest thereof) will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
Holders. A notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of
Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action with respect to an alleged Default or Event of
Default set forth in clauses (3), (4), (6), (7) or (8) of the first paragraph of this covenant may not be
given with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders, more than two years prior
to such notice or instruction. The Indenture will provide that the Trustee may withhold from the Holders
notice of any continuing Default, except a Default relating to the payment of principal, premium, if any,
or interest, if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(4) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event
of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in
full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not
enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.


-----

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive
all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal,
premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note held by a non-consenting Holder, which
may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its
consequences (including the payment default that resulted from such acceleration) if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise
to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to
be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at
the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against
any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security and/or
indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written
request and the security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee.

The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of
which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in
the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its
own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that
would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the
Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion
against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. It may not
be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of security or
indemnification to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.


-----

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in
writing of such occurrence by the Company, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders
within 60 days after being notified by the Company. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of
principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long
as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes; provided that, if any amendment, waiver or other modification will only
affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes of such series shall be required). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than
90% (or, in the case of clause (9) below, 75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of Notes
affected, an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any such series of Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder:

(1) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such Note
(other than provisions relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(2) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such Note (other than provisions
relating to Change of Control and Asset Dispositions);

(3) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any such Note or change the time at which
any such Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—Optional
_Redemption” or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;_

(4) make any such Note payable in currency other than that stated in such Note;

(5) impair the right of any Holder to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal
of, or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder’s Notes on or after the due dates
therefor;

(6) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “—Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in
respect thereof;

(7) release all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Collateral (taken as a whole) other than in accordance with the terms of the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement
and the Indenture; _provided that, for the avoidance of doubt and without prejudice to the_
covenant described under the heading “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security


-----

_Interest,” the release of less than all or substantially all Security Interests granted for the benefit_
of the Holders in the Collateral (taken as a whole) shall only require the consent of Holders of
at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and,
subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes);

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the
Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(9) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the Indenture,
except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(10) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to any amendment, waiver
or modification or make any other change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require
the Holders’ consent described in this sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with, the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of
Holders to receive payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on the Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Company, the Trustee and the
other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Company or a
Guarantor under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders
or make any change (including changing the ISIN or other identifying number on any Notes)
that does not adversely affect the rights of the Trustee or any Holder in any material respect;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of senior management of the Company) for the issuance of Additional Notes that may
be issued in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Guarantee in accordance with the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Notes Guarantee or Lien with respect to or securing the Notes
when such release, termination, discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the


-----

_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security_
Documents or the Notes;

(8) evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee
pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee to any Notes
Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a Security
Interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior
Facilities, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities
(as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a Security
Interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
Security Interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of
such Security Interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
_Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with;_

(10) make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending
of Notes as permitted by the Indenture, including to facilitate the issuance and administration
of Notes; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not
result in Notes being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities law and (ii) such amendment does not adversely affect the rights of Holders to transfer
Notes in any material respect;

(11) facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or
(b) the covenants described under the headings “—Merger and Consolidation” and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” relating to mergers,_
consolidations and sales of assets; or

(12) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decisions on such matters, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, as applicable) shall
be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder
given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.
The Indenture will not contain a covenant regulating the offer and/or payment of a consent fee to
Holders.

**Defeasance**

The Company at any time may terminate all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors under the
Notes Documents (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Company in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registrations of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Company exercises its legal defeasance option,
the Security Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect
to the defeasance trust).


-----

The Company at any time may terminate the obligations of it and the Restricted Subsidiaries under the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) of “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Company”) and “—Change of Control” and the default provisions relating to_
such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a
payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions (other than with respect
to the Company), the judgment default provision, the guarantee default provisions and the security
default provisions described under “—Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Company at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Company exercises its legal defeasance option,
payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to the Notes.
If the Company exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the
Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than clauses
(1), (2) and (4) of “—Merger and Consolidation—The Company”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the
Company and Significant Subsidiaries (or a group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of
the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
would constitute a Significant Subsidiary) of the Company), (6), (7) or (8) under “—Events of Default”
above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee cash in Euros or European Government Obligations or a
combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to
redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including
delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to customary assumptions and exclusions, to the effect that
Holders, in their capacity as Holders, will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law since the issuance of the
Notes);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent
of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Company; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided
for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been
complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of transfer or exchange of the Notes and rights of the Trustee,
as expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously
authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes and certain Notes for
which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the
Company) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at
their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the
name, and at the expense, of the Company; (2) the Company has deposited or caused to be deposited


-----

with the Trustee, money in Euros or European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as
applicable, in an amount that will be sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes
not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to
the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity
or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable under the Indenture; (4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee
under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or on
the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each stating that all conditions precedent under the “—
_Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the_
Indenture have been complied with; _provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s_
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
If requested in writing by the Company, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited to the
Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be; provided, however, that
the Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Company of such earlier
repayment date (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the
distribution and payment to Holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as set forth above will not
include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such
amounts. To the extent that the Notes are represented by Global Notes deposited with a depositary for
a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a participant of such
clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company or any
Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that
such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture will
provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in such Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its
own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated
in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Company, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received
in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other
transactions with the Company and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written
notice to the Company and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Company may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less


-----

than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
and expenses Incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the extent
that the rules of the Authority so require, notices of the Company with respect to the Notes will be sent
to the Authority.

All notices to Holders will be validly given if electronically delivered or mailed to them at their
respective addresses in the register of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. For so long as
any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will give such notices to the Holders of Book-Entry Interests in accordance with
the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, delivery of which shall be deemed to satisfy
the requirements of this paragraph.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided_ that, if
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and
the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed
to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder
or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on
the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, premium, if any, or
Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of interest on the Notes
will be prescribed six years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Company and the
Guarantors under or in connection with the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount received or recovered in a currency other than Euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement
of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Company,
any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due
to it from the Company or a Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Company or such
Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the Euro amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if
it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that Euro amount is less than the Euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
under any Note, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by

such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Company and the Guarantors will indemnify
the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase.
For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter
stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such
purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Company’s and
the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the
indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order,
claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any Notes Guarantee,
or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
Euro-denominated restriction herein, the Euro equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-Euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-Euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange will be approved or that permission to deal in the Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Company or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within
the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Company and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of
the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, in
the United States of America. The Indenture will provide that the Company and each Guarantor will
appoint an agent for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture,
the Notes and the Notes Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the
City of New York.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder, and the Notes
Guarantees thereunder, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the governing law of the Indenture and the Notes may be
amended with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes). The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England. The Security Documents will
be governed by the laws of Germany.

any Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or
discontinued operation that would have required adjustment pursuant to this definition, then the Fixed

Investment, acquisition, disposition, merger, amalgamation, consolidation or disposed or discontinued

determination date had been the applicable rate for the entire Relevant Testing Period or (y) using the
average rate in effect over the Relevant Testing Period, in each case taking into account any Hedging
Obligations applicable to such Indebtedness. As determined in accordance with the Election Option (as
applicable), interest on a lease (including any Capitalized Lease Obligations) shall be deemed to accrue
at an interest rate reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the
Company to be the rate of interest implicit in such lease in accordance with IFRS. For purposes of

computed with a _pro forma basis shall be computed based upon the average daily balance of such_
Indebtedness during the Relevant Testing Period except to the extent such revolving credit facility has
been permanently repaid and the commitments thereunder cancelled. Interest on Indebtedness that may
optionally be determined at an interest rate based upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency

covenant described under “—Reports”); and (ii) any adverse impact directly or indirectly relating to or
resulting from the implementation of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and any
successor standard thereto (or any equivalent measure under GAAP) shall be disregarded with respect

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes sold to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the U.S.
Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (a “Rule 144A Global Note”). The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States in
compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global
note in registered form without interest coupons attached (a “Regulation S Global Note” and, together
with the Rule 144A Global Note, the “Global Notes”). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue
Date, with, or on behalf of, a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Note (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Note (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and,
together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through
such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their
participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their
respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests
will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your
ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Senior Secured Notes are
in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of the
Senior Secured Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear
and/or Clearstream (or its nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global
Notes for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, respectively.

None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the
Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the BookEntry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive
definitive registered Senior Secured Notes in certificated form (“Definitive Registered Notes”) only:

(i) if either Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that it is unwilling
or unable to continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer within 120 days; or

(ii) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.


-----

In such an event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will instruct the Registrar to issue Definitive
Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested
by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or us, as applicable (in accordance with their respective
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial
ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive
legend as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless that legend is not required by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent and the Registrar shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as
the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.
Ownership of the relevant Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and such registration is a means of evidencing title
to the Senior Secured Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Senior Secured Notes; however, owners
of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation
of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event that any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the
amount received by them in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price
payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount
received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global
Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under the existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear
and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with
adjustments to prevent fractions), by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate
(including the pool factor) unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depositary
requirements; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global
Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest and additional amounts, if any) to the Paying
Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will
distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever
nature, except as may be required by law and as described under “Description of the Notes—
_Withholding Taxes.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made, then, to the extent_
described under “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes,” we will pay additional amounts as
may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of
Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder
or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the
case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects that
standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners
of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Registrar, the Transfer Agent and the Paying Agent and their respective agents will treat the
registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its


-----

nominee)) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer
Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

- any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests to such Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear or
Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Senior Secured Notes (including the presentation of Senior Secured Notes for exchange as
described above) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Senior Secured Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes, reserve the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered
Notes and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Senior Secured Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell Senior Secured Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such
securities or to pledge such securities, such holder of Senior Secured Notes must transfer its interests in
the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the


-----

form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable
securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal
amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the
Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such Senior Secured Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global
Note, and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a BookEntry Interest.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. We have provided the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for
the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by
the settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of us, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

We understand as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold
securities for participating organizations. They facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and
Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers,
banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is
also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or
otherwise take action in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate


-----

for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Senior Secured Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List
of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or
Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Guarantor, the
Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or the Paying Agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants
of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned
through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to
conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against
payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Trustee’s Powers**

While title to the Senior Secured Notes is registered in the name of a nominee of Euroclear or
Clearstream, the Trustee may rely without further investigation on any information provided to it by
Euroclear or Clearstream as to the identity (either individually or by category) of its participants with
entitlements to Senior Secured Notes and may consider such Book-Entry Interests as if such participants
were the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.


-----

reliance on Rule 144A and outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation
S.

We have not registered and will not register the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees under the U.S.
Securities Act and, therefore, the Senior Secured Notes may not be offered or sold within the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Senior Secured
Notes to the Initial Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

- in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as
defined in Rule 144A in compliance with Rule 144A; and

subject thereto and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in

Regulation S.

(3) It acknowledges that none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the

Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been delivered to it and upon which it is


-----

relying in making its investment decision with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. It has had
access to such financial and other information concerning us, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its subsidiaries and the Senior Secured Notes as it has deemed necessary in connection with
its decision to purchase any of the Senior Secured Notes, including an opportunity to ask

Purchasers. It acknowledges that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the
Initial Purchasers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of
this Offering Memorandum. It acknowledges that we, and not the Initial Purchasers, have
ultimate authority over the statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the
content of those statements and whether and how to communicate them.

(4) It is purchasing the Senior Secured Notes for its own account, or for one or more investor
accounts for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with
a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the
U.S. Securities Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the
disposition of its property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such Senior Secured Notes
pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under
the U.S. Securities Act.

(5) Each holder of Senior Secured Notes issued in reliance on Rule 144A (“Rule 144A Senior
Secured Notes”) agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing Senior Secured Notes, and each subsequent holder of the Rule 144A Senior Secured
Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such
Senior Secured Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”) that is one
year after the later of the Issue Date and the last date on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any of its affiliates was the owner of such Senior Secured Notes (or any predecessor thereto)

of a QIB to whom notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (iv)
pursuant to offers and sales that occur outside the United States in compliance with Regulation
S, or (v) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding
and disposal of the Senior Secured Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all
German tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Senior Secured Notes and, in
particular, does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser.
This summary is based on the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this
Offering Memorandum, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposal of the Senior Secured Notes, including
the effect of any state, local or church taxes, under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which
they are resident or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing interest payments received by an individual holder of the Senior Secured Notes who is a
German tax resident (i.e., persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective
management is located in Germany) will be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer)
if the Senior Secured Notes are kept or administered in a custodial account with or presented for an
over-the-counter payment to a German securities institution or a German branch of a German or nonGerman bank or financial services institution or if no German bank or financial institution is the
Disbursing Agent, the Issuer (each, a “Disbursing Agent” (inländische auszahlende Stelle)). The
withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing Agent is 25% (plus the solidarity surcharge at a
rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax
will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking
notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern), in
which case the holders will have to include the income in the tax return and will then be assessed for
church tax. Further, church tax is not collected by way of withholding if the investment income forms
part of income from trade business, self-employment, agriculture and forestry, or letting and leasing.
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the Senior Secured Notes should under German law not be required
to deduct withholding tax from the proceeds of the investment in the Senior Secured Notes.

The same treatment applies to capital gains (i.e., the difference between the proceeds from the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment after the deduction of expenses directly related to the disposal,
redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking into account currency gains and
losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Senior Secured Notes (“Accrued Interest,” _Stückzinsen)_
derived by an individual holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period
provided that the Senior Secured Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing
Agent since the time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately
(i.e., without the Senior Secured Notes), the proceeds from the disposal are subject to withholding tax.
The same applies to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims
if the Senior Secured Notes have been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Senior Secured Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account
with the same Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus the solidarity surcharge at a rate
of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the
disposal proceeds (plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided
with evidence of the actual acquisition costs of the Senior Secured Notes by the previous Disbursing
Agent or by a statement of a bank, financial services or securities institution within the European Union,
the EEA or the countries/territories Luxembourg, Austria, the Swiss Confederation, the Republic of San
Marino, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra,


-----

Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment
of the Senior Secured Notes has been calculated on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather
than from the actual gain), a German tax resident individual holder may also apply for an assessment
on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however, if the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal
proceeds a German tax resident individual holder is obligated to apply for an assessment on the basis
of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis
of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Senior
Secured Notes via the Disbursing Agent (e.g., losses from the sale of other securities with the exception
of shares in stock corporations and forward transactions). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct
Accrued Interest on the Senior Secured Notes or other securities paid separately upon the acquisition of
the respective security via the Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and
restrictions, the Disbursing Agent may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in
a given year regarding securities held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the
Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing
Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000
(€2,000 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz
_über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of_
tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax
will be deducted if the holder of the Senior Secured Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a
certificate of non-assessment (Nichtveranlagungs Bescheinigung) issued by the competent tax
authorities.

German withholding tax will generally not apply to gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of Senior Secured Notes held by a corporate holder who is a German tax resident (including
via a commercial partnership, as the case may be, and provided that in the case of corporations of certain
legal forms the status of “corporation” has been evidenced by a certificate of the competent tax
authorities) while ongoing payments, such as interest payments, are subject to withholding tax
(irrespective of any deductions of foreign tax and losses incurred). The same may apply where the
Senior Secured Notes form part of a trade or business (of an individual or of a commercial partnership)
subject to further requirements being met.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general, not subject to German withholding tax on investment income
and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital gain is subject to German
taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains—Non-Tax
_Residents”) and the Senior Secured Notes are held in a custodial account with a German Disbursing_
Agent, withholding tax will be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be
refunded based on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty
(Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen). In addition, non-residents of Germany may be subject to German
withholding tax if they are resident in a non-cooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives
_Steuerhoheitsgebiet) which is mentioned on the EU list of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions (as outlined_
below under “—Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition”).

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (i.e., persons
whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control is located
in Germany).


-----

Income derived from capital investments under the Senior Secured Notes held by an individual holder
who is tax resident in Germany is in general subject to German income tax at a flat-tax rate of 25%
(plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) (Abgeltungsteuer) if the Senior Secured
Notes are held as a private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in
Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €1,000 (€2,000 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly_
attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income
from capital investments under the Senior Secured Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax
withheld (as described under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not
been levied, such as in the case of Senior Secured Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing
Agent being involved in the payment process or if the withholding tax on the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment has been calculated from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual
gain), the individual holder must include its interest income and capital gains derived from the Senior
Secured Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be taxed at a rate of 25% (plus the solidarity
surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Furthermore, an individual holder may apply for
the taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower individual tax rate based upon an
assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In each case, the deduction of
expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted. Losses incurred with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual holder
realized in the same or following assessment periods.

Losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht)
or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a Third-party or from any other default can only be offset
against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective
losses exceeding the amount of €20,000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax periods
(together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €20,000
per year. Given that this offset with losses will be applied by the Disbursing Agent (as defined above)
holding the Notes in custody, Noteholders suffering losses are required to declare such losses in their
income tax return.

Where Senior Secured Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the
income from the Senior Secured Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the
withholding tax, if any, will not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income
is subject to individual or corporate income tax (plus the solidarity surcharge and, where applicable,
church tax). Where Senior Secured Notes form part of a trade or business, interest (including Accrued
Interest) and capital gains must be taken into account as income. The respective holder must include
income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the balance will be taxed at the
holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited as advance payment against
the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent exceeding this personal or
corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Senior Secured Notes form part of a German trade
or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of
the Senior Secured Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax
liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly
credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany (i.e.,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat and place of effective management and control
is not located in Germany).


-----

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Senior Secured Notes received by holders
who are not tax resident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Senior
Secured Notes form part of the business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent
representative, or a fixed base maintained in Germany by the holder; (ii) the income otherwise
constitutes German-source income (such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs
property or income from capital investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate
or income from a hybrid instrument issued by a German tax resident issuer, unless the Senior Secured
Notes qualify as global certificates (Sammelurkunden) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German
Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as fungible notes representing the same issue
(Teilschuldverschreibungen)) or (iii) the income is attributable to an investor resident in a noncooperative tax jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) which is mentioned on the EU list
of non-cooperative tax jurisdictions (as outlined below under “—Act Combating Tax Avoidance and
_Unfair Tax Competition”). We expect the Senior Secured Notes to qualify for the exception in case (ii)_
so long as they are held in global form. In cases (i) and (ii) a tax regime similar to that explained above
under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who are not tax resident in Germany may
become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive the proceeds by way of an over-thecounter payment by a German Disbursing Agent and the Senior Secured Notes are not held in custody
with the same German Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not tax
resident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable tax
treaty.

**_Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain
individuals. The solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital investments and, thus, on
withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower
than 25% the holder can apply for his/her capital investment income being assessed at his/her individual
tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Senior Secured Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German
inheritance or gift tax if the decedent, donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the
transfer a resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a
resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or
gift taxes will be levied unless (i) the Senior Secured Notes are attributable to a German trade or
business for which a permanent establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been
appointed in Germany or (ii) the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are directly or indirectly
secured by German-situs real estate (unless the Senior Secured Notes qualify as fungible notes
representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). We expect the Senior Secured Notes to
qualify for this exception so long as they are held in global form. Exceptions from this rule apply to
certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany.

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or similar duties will be payable in Germany in connection with
the issuance, delivery or execution of the Senior Secured Notes. Currently, net assets tax
(Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax_**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) are intending to introduce a
financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial
intermediary). The timing of its potential introduction is, however, still unclear. The implementation of
a financial transaction tax in Germany is no longer included in the most recent coalition agreement


-----

signed on December 7, 2021. Prospective holders of the Senior Secured Notes are advised to seek their
own professional advice in relation to the financial transaction tax.

**_Proposed Abolishment of German Withholding Tax on Interest Income_**

There is an ongoing discussion in Germany whether the current flat taxation (Abgeltungsteuer) of 25%
(plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church
tax, if applicable) on interest income received by private individuals, should be increased or abolished
so that investment income would be taxed at the individual taxpayer’s income tax rates. It is still unclear
whether, how and when the current discussion may result in any legislative changes. As a result of such
amendment, interest on the Senior Secured Notes could become subject to a taxation at a respective
noteholder’s individual personal tax rate—where such noteholder is a tax resident of Germany—up to
a tax rate of 45% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being
26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable).

**_Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition_**

Pursuant to the Act Combating Tax Avoidance and Unfair Tax Competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von
_Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb), which entered into force in Germany on June 26,_
2021, income generated, inter alia, from financial relationships (Finanzierungsbeziehungen) is subject
to a withholding tax if the creditor of such financial relationships is resident in a non-cooperative tax
jurisdiction (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) which is mentioned on the EU list of noncooperative tax jurisdictions, as amended from time to time.

Since there are currently neither official guidelines from the legislator and/or the German tax authorities
nor court rulings on the interpretation of the term ‘financial relationships' (Finanzierungsbeziehungen)
available, it cannot be excluded that issuers of exchange listed notes such as the Notes are obliged to
effect a deduction from the payment under such notes to Noteholders resident in non-cooperative tax
jurisdictions pursuant to this law.

Should this be the case, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would be obliged to effect a withholding of
taxes from payments of interest made to Noteholders resident in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions.
However, according to recently introduced legislation no withholding tax will be levied if bearer notes
are represented by a global note (Sammelurkunde), are held in collective safe custody with a central
depositary, and are tradable on a recognized stock exchange.

**_ATAD 3 (Shell Entities)_**

On December 22, 2021, the Council of the European Union published the proposal for a Council
Directive laying down rules to prevent the misuse of so-called shell entities for tax purposes and
amending Directive 2011/16/EU. Under this ATAD 3 proposal, certain reporting obligations would be
imposed on entities resident in an EU member state for tax purposes that cross certain substance
'gateways'. If, in addition, these entities qualify as shell entities pursuant to specific substance tests, they
would not be able to access the benefits of double tax treaties in force with their jurisdiction of residence,
as well as of certain EU Directives.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

**_General_**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential tax effects. The summary is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder
(as defined below), except for the discussions below under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance,” and
does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, such
as estate and gift tax laws or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.


-----

This discussion is based upon the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and judicial and administrative
interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change at any
time, possibly with retroactive effect which could significantly affect the accuracy of the U.S. federal
income tax considerations described below. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. The
discussion below is not binding upon the IRS or the courts. There can be no assurance that the IRS will
not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition
of the Senior Secured Notes than those discussed herein or that a court would not sustain any such
position in the event of litigation. A different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect
the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Senior
Secured Notes.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant
to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the
Medicare contribution tax on net investment income, the alternative minimum tax, the base erosion and
anti-abuse tax under Section 59A of the Code, or special tax accounting rules that apply as a result of
gross income with respect to the Senior Secured Notes being taken into account on an “applicable
financial statement” (as defined in Section 451 of the Code) or to holders subject to special rules, such
as banks, brokers-dealers, mutual funds, small business investment companies, certain financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement and other tax deferred
accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. Holders whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate
investment trusts, partnerships, subchapter S corporations or other pass-through entities and investors
in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, persons that actually or constructively
own 10% or more of the combined voting power of our voting stock or of the total value of our stock,
and persons holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction”
or other integrated transaction. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Senior
Secured Notes for cash at original issue at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at which a substantial
amount of the Senior Secured Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the Senior Secured Notes as capital assets (generally, property held for
investment) within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note that is,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,
(ii) a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal
income taxation regardless of its source or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to
exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more “United States
persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all
substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid election under the applicable Treasury
regulations in place to be treated as a “United States person” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)
of the Code).

If any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Senior Secured
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in
the Senior Secured Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding
the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior
Secured Notes.

The summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general
information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes should consult their tax
advisors concerning the tax consequences of holding Senior Secured Notes in light of their particular


-----

circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below,
as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax
laws.

**_IPO Debt Pushdown_**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake an IPO Debt Pushdown (as described under “—
_Provisions following an IPO”), pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to give_
notice that the terms of the Debt Documents shall operate on the basis that references to the Senior
Secured Group (and all related provisions) shall apply only to the IPO Debt Pushdown Entity and its
Subsidiaries which are Restricted Subsidiaries. Such a modification to the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes could be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Senior
Secured Notes as in place prior to such modifications for (ii) new Senior Secured Notes as in place after
such modifications (“New Notes”). If such modifications resulted in a deemed exchange, such a deemed
exchange could be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which certain
beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes could be required to recognize gain or loss. The amount
of any gain or loss recognized upon such a deemed exchange of a Senior Secured Note for a New Note
would be determined by reference to the “issue price” of the New Note. The issue price of a New Note
will equal the fair market value of such Senior Secured Note or such New Note at the time of the deemed
exchange if such Senior Secured Note or such New Note were considered “publicly traded” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the IPO Debt Pushdown is treated as a taxable transaction for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, a U.S. Holder’s holding period in a New Note treated as received in the
IPO Debt Pushdown generally will commence on the day after the IPO Debt Pushdown, and tax basis
in such New Note would generally equal the issue price of such New Note. Generally, any gain or loss
recognized as a result of such deemed exchange will be taxed under the rules described under “—Sale,
_Exchange, Retirement, Redemption, or Other Taxable Disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.” If the_
issue price of such New Note is less than its stated redemption price at maturity by a de minimis amount
or more than a de minimis amount, such New Note will be treated as issued with original issue discount
(“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event, U.S. Holders would be required to include
such OID in their income (as ordinary income) as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income on the Senior Secured Notes. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors as to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to modification of the Senior Secured
Notes in connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown, including the U.S. federal income tax considerations
of a deemed exchange and resulting OID, if any. In addition, the determination of whether the deemed
New Notes are treated as foreign currency contingent payment debt instruments would be made at the
time of the modification.

**_Additional Payments_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of the Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the
_Notes—Optional Redemption,” and “Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes”) we may be_
obligated or elect to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Senior Secured Notes.
If any such payment is treated as a contingent payment, subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured
Notes may be treated as contingent payment debt instruments, in which case the timing and amount of
income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences
discussed herein. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the
possibility of such additional amounts payable on the Senior Secured Notes is a remote or incidental
contingency within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations as of the date hereof, and thus does
not result in the Senior Secured Notes being treated as contingent payment debt instruments under
applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS
on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Senior Secured Notes that it is taking a different
position. However, our position is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that
described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on its Senior Secured Notes based


-----

upon a comparable yield, regardless of its method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield
at which we would issue a fixed rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and
conditions otherwise similar to those of the Senior Secured Notes, and may exceed the stated interest
rate. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, redemption, or other taxable disposition of the Senior
Secured Notes would generally be recharacterized as ordinary income. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if the Senior Secured Notes were treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The discussion below assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be
treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

It is anticipated, and this discussion assumes, that the Senior Secured Notes will not be issued with OID
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, a U.S.
Holder will be taxed on any stated interest income on a Senior Secured Note (including additional
amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) as
ordinary income at the time the interest income is received or when it accrues, depending on the U.S.
Holder’s methods of accounting for U.S. tax purposes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income (as
ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest payment on a Senior Secured
Note based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in
fact converted into U.S. dollars. No foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognized with
respect to the receipt of such payment (other than foreign currency exchange gain or loss realized on
the disposition of the euros so received; see “—Exchange of Foreign Currency”).

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting (or who is otherwise required to accrue
interest prior to receipt) will accrue stated interest income (as ordinary income) on a Senior Secured
Note in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

- the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof, within
such U.S. Holder’s taxable year; or

- at such U.S. Holder’s election, at the spot rate of exchange on (i) the last day of the accrual
period, or the last day of the taxable year within such accrual period if the accrual period spans
more than one taxable year or (ii) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days
of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S.
Holder to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year
to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and can be changed only
with the consent of the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the
advisability of making such election.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of a stated interest payment (including, upon the sale of a Senior Secured
Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between (i) the value of the euros received
as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt,
regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value
of the stated interest previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency
exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source,
and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Senior Secured
Notes.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Subject to the discussion of exchange gain or loss above, stated interest on a Senior Secured Note
generally will be income from sources outside of the United States and, for purposes of calculating any


-----

U.S. foreign tax credits, generally will be considered passive category income. Any non-U.S.
withholding tax paid with respect to the Senior Secured Notes held by a U.S. Holder at the rate
applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or a deduction in lieu of such credits)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There are significant limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to
claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and
depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances, and recent Treasury regulations have imposed
additional requirements that must be met for a foreign tax to be creditable (including requirements that
a “covered withholding tax” be imposed on nonresidents in lieu of a generally applicable tax that
satisfies the regulatory definition of an “income tax,” which may be unclear or difficult to determine).
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any
withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption, or Other Taxable Disposition of the Senior Secured Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior
Secured Note, except as noted below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, a U.S.
Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the amount
realized by such U.S. Holder (except to the extent such amount is attributable to accrued but unpaid
interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as described above under “—Payments
_of Stated Interest”) and such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. Subject to the_
discussion below, the adjusted tax basis of a Senior Secured Note to a U.S. Holder will generally be the
U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of
purchase. If a U.S. Holder receives euros on the disposition of a Senior Secured Note, the amount
realized by such U.S. Holder will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euros received calculated at
the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition.

If the Senior Secured Notes are traded on an established securities market, a U.S. Holder that uses the
cash method of tax accounting, and if it so elects, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax
accounting, will determine the U.S. dollar values of its adjusted tax bases in a Senior Secured Note and
the amount realized on the disposition of a Senior Secured Note by translating euro amounts at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition, respectively. The election
available to accrual basis U.S. Holders discussed above must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder
to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS. An
accrual-basis U.S. Holder that does not make the election will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the
settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.

Any capital gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other taxable
disposition of a Senior Secured Note will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder’s holding
period for the Senior Secured Notes exceeds one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains
recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. Capital gain or loss,
if any, recognized by a U.S. Holder generally will be treated as U.S.-source income or loss for purposes
of calculating the U.S. foreign tax credit limitation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations.

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on a sale, exchange, retirement at maturity, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss
to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in the euro-to-U.S.-dollar exchange rate with
respect to the principal amount of such Senior Secured Note during the period in which the U.S. Holder
held such Senior Secured Note. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Senior Secured Note is
the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price of the Note. Such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will
equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price calculated at the spot rate
of exchange on the date (i) the Senior Secured Note is disposed of (or the spot rate on the settlement
date, if applicable) and (ii) of purchase (or the spot rate on the settlement date, if applicable). In addition,
upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note,


-----

a U.S. Holder may realize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with
respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—
_Payments of Stated Interest.” The recognition of foreign currency exchange gain or loss described in_
this paragraph will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of a Senior
Secured Note and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States
for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes and will not be treated as interest income or expense,
including for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

**_Exchange of Foreign Currency_**

Foreign currency (including any euros) received as interest on, or on the sale or other disposition of, a
Senior Secured Note will have an adjusted tax basis equal to its U.S. dollar value at the time such interest
is received or at the time such proceeds from disposition are received. The amount of gain or loss
recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or other disposition of such foreign currency in exchange for
U.S. dollars will be equal to the difference between (i) the amount of U.S. dollars received and (ii) the
U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency. Upon any subsequent exchange of such
foreign currency for property, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize exchange gain or loss equal to the
difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency based on the spot rate of exchange
for such foreign currency on the date of the exchange and (ii) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in
the foreign currency so exchanged. A U.S. Holder that purchases a Senior Secured Note with previously
owned foreign currency will generally recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if
any, between such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such foreign currency and the U.S. dollar value
of the foreign currency that it paid for the Senior Secured Notes based on the spot rate of exchange on
the date of purchase. As discussed above, if the Senior Secured Notes are traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (or an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder) will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency paid for the Senior Secured Notes or received upon disposition
of the Senior Secured Notes by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate of exchange on
the settlement date of the purchase or the disposition.

Any such foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S.-source ordinary income or loss.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting to the IRS of certain tax
shelter transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum
amount (e.g., $50,000 in the case of an individual or trust), such as the receipt or accrual of interest or
a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency
received in respect of a foreign currency note. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors to
determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with
respect to the ownership or disposition of the Senior Secured Notes or any related transaction such as
the disposition of any euros received in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of principal and interest on the
Senior Secured Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement or
redemption) of a Senior Secured Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt
recipient (such as a corporation) and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor
(which may be us or an intermediate payor) will be required to impose backup withholding, currently
at a rate of 24%, on such payments if (i) in the case of any payments described in this paragraph, (a) the
U.S. Holder fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number and certify under penalties of
perjury that such taxpayer identification number is the U.S. Holder’s correct taxpayer identification
number, or to establish an exemption from backup withholding, or (b) the IRS notifies the payor that
the taxpayer identification number furnished by the U.S. Holder is incorrect, or (ii) in the case of interest
payments, (x) there has been a “notified payee underreporting” described in Section 3406(c) of the Code


-----

or (y) the U.S. Holder fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the IRS has not notified it that it is
subject to backup withholding under the Code. Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any
amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a
U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of
the backup withholding rules on their particular circumstances.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. Holders who are individuals and who hold an interest in “specified foreign financial assets”
(as defined in Section 6038D of the Code) with an aggregate value exceeding certain threshold amounts
(including certain amounts at any time during the tax year), are required to report information relating
to an interest in the Senior Secured Notes on IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including
an exception for Senior Secured Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions).
Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of the foregoing
rules. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this requirement on
their ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes generally will
constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Senior
Secured Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance_**

Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder
(“FATCA”) generally impose a withholding tax (currently at a rate of 30%) on interest paid on a debt
obligation to (i) a foreign financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the
beneficial owner), unless such institution (A) enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to
collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account
holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as
well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners) and to withhold certain
amounts or (B) is a resident in a country that has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States in relation to such withholding and information reporting and the financial institution
complies with the related information reporting requirements of such country or (ii) a foreign entity that
is not a financial institution (as the beneficial owner or as an intermediary for the beneficial owner),
unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial U.S.
owners of the entity, which generally includes any “United States person” (as defined in the Code) who
directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity, in each case, unless another exemption applies.
Although FATCA withholding may also apply to gross proceeds of a disposition of a debt obligation,
proposed regulations (that may be relied upon pending finalization) suspend withholding on such gross
proceeds payments indefinitely.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final
regulations defining pass-through payments are published generally would be “grandfathered” unless
materially modified after such date. No such regulations have been filed as of the date hereof.
Accordingly, even if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA
would apply to payments on the Senior Secured Notes only if there is a significant modification of the
Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering
period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional nonU.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that
alters the rules described herein. Investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors
regarding the implications on their investments in a Senior Secured Note.


-----

**Certain General Income Tax Considerations**

**_Payments by Guarantors_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on Senior Secured Notes it is possible that
such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates, subject to such relief as may be
available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption that
may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for exemption from
withholding tax. Holders of Senior Secured Notes should consult with their tax advisors regarding the
tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX
MATTERS THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH
PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE
TAX CONSEQUENCES TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES IN
LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR’S OWN CIRCUMSTANCES.


-----

**LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE SECURITY INTERESTS**
**AND GUARANTEES AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have
their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. Set forth
below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security
interests, and a summary of certain insolvency law considerations, in Germany. This is a summary only,
and bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar proceeding could be initiated in Germany and in the jurisdiction
of organization or centre of main interest of a future guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes. The
application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which
jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to
collect payment in full under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests on the
Collateral.

**European Union**

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the Senior Notes Issuer, as third-party
security provider, are incorporated under the laws of Germany, a Member State of the European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from
June 26, 2017, which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall
have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under
the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation). The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of
fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The “centre of main interests" is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the
Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (which
presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State within the
three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1), second
sentence, of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “centre of main interests" shall be the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is
ascertainable by third parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in
determining the “centre of main interests” of a company in that respect, including, in particular, where
board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has
its head office, and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established.

If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU
Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark),
although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under
Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark)
have jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if
such company has an “establishment" (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment" is defined to
mean “any place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in the three month period
prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human


-----

means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in
another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in
the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the
assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member
State in which the debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to
Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only
be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of
main interests" is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency
proceedings are commenced at the request of

(i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment
situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial
(secondary) proceedings is requested or

(ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State
in which the establishment is located.

Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3
shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely
linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation
shall, in general, not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or
intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a
whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of
another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim enforced, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect
of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as
no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a
court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s
“centre of main interest” is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that
Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member
State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that
other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to
commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.


-----

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the
court of the main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member
State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary
has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. It
may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title
pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other
Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member
State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets
or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority
rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were
opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law
of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a
court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors (Article 38 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation).

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not
exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request
from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months,
unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings.
Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of
realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency
proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary
insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing
difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an
insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings
of the group’s members. The EU Insolvency Regulations provides

(i) for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of
the secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency
practitioners;

(ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the
efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part
of the same group;

(iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and


-----

(iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of
such insolvency registers.

**_EU directive on preventative restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring
Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to
address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented
and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for
a framework pursuant to which (i) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (ii) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (iii) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount
of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (iv) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the
plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the
protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new
financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing
granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive had to be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17,
2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period
for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer experiences
financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions
insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced (also if the then relevant “centre of main
interest” can be determined), or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may
affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior
Notes Issuer. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organized or operate may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be
applied in relation to one another.


-----

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the Senior Notes Issuer are organized under the
laws of Germany, have their registered offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are
located in Germany. In the event of an insolvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or of a Guarantor
or the Senior Notes Issuer having its “centre of main interests” in Germany (presumed to be in Germany
in the absence of proof of the contrary) at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed, any (main) insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated
at the registered office of the relevant entity in the absence of proof of the contrary, unless such
registered office has been transferred from another Member State during the 3-month period prior to
the opening of insolvency proceedings. A centre of main interest in a jurisdiction other than the one
where the registered office is located may, in particular, result from the respective entity’s decision
making process being located in such jurisdiction). Any (main) proceedings in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors would therefore be governed by German law.

However, in case the debtor has an establishment in another jurisdiction (i.e. is carrying out a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets in such jurisdiction), insolvency proceedings
over certain assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer may be
opened in other jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another Member State of the
European Union. Such proceedings would be limited to the assets located in such jurisdiction. With
respect to cross-border group insolvencies, Art 56 et seq. Recast Insolvency Regulation introduced
requirements facilitating communication and cooperation between the administrators and courts
involved. In addition, a coordination procedure may be initiated, which involves the appointment of a
coordinator and the adoption of a cross-border coordination plan. See “—European Union.”

The insolvency and restructuring laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG),
may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of the United States or
another jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including in respect of priority of creditors, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as, in certain circumstances, priority recovery for secured
creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Senior Secured Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising and other
insolvency laws.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany:

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings. Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event
of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning, according to case law, that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of
its debts due or falling due within the next three weeks for a period longer than three weeks. According
to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted
when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation
of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich)
generally based on a 12 months’ forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose).

If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung), a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft), a European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any
other company not having an individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a
situation of illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over indebtedness (Überschuldung), each
managing director of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members of the
supervisory board, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three weeks


-----

after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after such over indebtedness
(Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these
obligations exposes management to both severe damages claims as well as sanctions under criminal
law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening of insolvency proceedings
or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring Framework") in the event of
imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), if there is the imminent risk of the company being
unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time within a prognosis period of, in
general, 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to
an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for insolvency proceedings.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession" proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung),_ if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turnaround plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is
not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on
incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or
is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for preliminary
“debtor in possession” protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmveifahren), unless —from a third
party perspective— there is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. Upon such filing by
the debtor, the court will appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit
enforcement measures (other than with respect to immovable assets). It may also implement other
preliminary measures to protect the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months.
During the period of either the preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmveifahren), the debtor shall prepare_
an insolvency plan which ideally shall be implemented in formal “debtor-in-possession" proceedings
(Eigenverwaltung) after formal insolvency proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary proceedings
(Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any
measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary
proceedings (other than with respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent required to ensure the
continuation of the debtor’s business, prohibit the enforcement of any collateral granted over claims,
rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the enforcement of collateral is prohibited by the insolvency
court, secured creditors have to be adequately compensated by the insolvency estate.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will supervise
the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint a
preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the
preliminary administrator or the preliminary trustee depend on the decision of the court. The duties of
the preliminary administrator or preliminary trustee may include safeguarding and preserving the
debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover at least the
costs of the insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision of the court, even the right to manage
the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to the preliminary insolvency
administrator, whilst in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor’s management retains the right
to manage business. However, the court may also order that certain disposals of the debtor may require
the preliminary trustee’s consent also in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings. The insolvency court can
also order a stay of all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary
creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the
following three requirements:


-----

(i) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over indebted);

(ii) revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

(iii) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, _inter alios, part time_
employees).

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in
the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following:
the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), a preliminary
trustee (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) or trustee
(Sachwalter), and court orders for “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der
_Eigenverwaltung)_ or consent to significant disposals by the estate.

The court opens formal insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition
has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets
to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to
be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if
third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the
court will only appoint a trustee (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by the
debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency administrator
(Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s assets,
whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such
change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims)
has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed
individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial.
Individual creditors, or the debtor, can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency
administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the
appointment. The insolvency administrator (or in the case of “debtor in possession proceedings,” the
debtor) may raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s
operations, and satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate
(Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be preferred to any unsecured insolvency liabilities created by the debtor
including, e.g., the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees (as applicable).
Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the respective collateral
(if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this regard. However, in “debtor-in-possession”
proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in the ordinary course of business without the
trustee’s (Sachwalter) consent.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

The insolvency administrator (or trustee in case of “debtor-in-possession proceedings”) may also
challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected
prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent
_Transfer”)._


-----

For the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency
proceedings against any the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer
would include, among possible voidance actions and other things, the following:

(i) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of a relevant debtor’s assets would generally pass to the insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the insolvency estate;

(ii) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals
effected by a relevant debtor’s management after the opening of insolvency proceedings are
null and void by operation of law;

(iii) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter,
a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of
the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening
of the insolvency proceedings;

(iv) claims against the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), and

(v) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e. the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
restructuring proceedings or the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency proceedings
(insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid in case of insolvency
proceedings such clause would frustrate the election right of the insolvency administrator whether or
not to perform the contract (Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects
termination rights applicable under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not
governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to
a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to
participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the relevant debtor and
the rights they claim in the assets of the relevant debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the
exception of certain secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by
any of its creditors is subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened
(and, if so ordered by a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time
when insolvency proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings
and creditors may generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings
separately, but can instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, also unsecured creditors may file their claims in the
insolvency proceedings and will be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent
sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security
interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have
only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case,


-----

secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such
realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains
entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its
possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable
assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii)
to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). As
opposed thereto and according to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof), secured creditors are entitled to realize pledges over uncertificated shares or other
rights like IP on their own. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) viewed in an older decision the insolvency administrator competent to realize
pledged shares in a corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account
(Depot) in Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged
company. This decision was not explicitly overtaken in the more recent decision.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal
proceeds (Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain
contributory charges of typically 9% (plus VAT) (or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at
least 4%) for (i) assessing the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid
to the creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured
claims. Remaining amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate
(Insolvenzmasse) (being the remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after deduction
of the costs of the insolvency proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency
administrator, the insolvency administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the
(preliminary) creditors’ committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed
among the non-preferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Senior Secured Notes (to
the extent not satisfied after enforcement of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes). If the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or a subsidiary thereof subject to
German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such
security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the
disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the (guarantee) obligations under the Senior Secured Notes after such secured
creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it
may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are
distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in
an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
or, in “debtor-in-possession proceedings,” by the trustee (upon instruction of the preliminary creditors’
committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the debtor as well
as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The insolvency court
may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain conditions (cram
down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge of secured and
unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may also create,
modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If the debtor is
a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor can also be
included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to third parties
or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. Thus, an insolvency plan could under certain
circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the Senior Secured Notes or Guarantees (as
applicable) which are less favorable to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes than the provisions of


-----

the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of Collateral or the release of
obligations under the Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such provisions could be adopted against
the votes of the affected holders of the Senior Secured Notes. However, it will not be possible to force
a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-for-equity swap under the
proposed insolvency plan.

An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other
security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor
affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided
that the relevant debtor affiliate (the Senior Notes Issuer) consents to the impairment. Creditors affected
by such impairment are entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under
the Senior Secured Notes and Guarantees can get impaired if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would
enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or not the relevant Guarantor is itself
subject of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an
insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular,
no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each
entity have to be dealt with separately. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has
provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group
companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings
of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies
or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order
to facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may assume jurisdiction
for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand), (ii) a single person may be
appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain coordination
obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’ committees, and
(iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings” (Koordinationsverfahren) and the
appointm‘nt of a “coordinator” ('Verfahrenskoordinator) with the ability to propose a “coordination
plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court (Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees may be
enforced against the relevant debtor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency proceedings over the
assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall
financial situation of the entire group of affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may
cause a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer to subsequently file for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law
(including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor
for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government
developments banks and its affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the
Indenture may result in the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being
considered in a “shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an
insolvency proceeding over the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior
Notes Issuer, the claims arising from the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees would be treated as a
subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen). Subordinated insolvency claims
are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the assets of a the relevant debtor
unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted special permission allowing these
subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the vast majority of insolvency cases
governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor of the insolvency estate only after
the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims of regular, unsecured creditors.


-----

_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event
that “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the trustee (Sachwalter)
may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed detrimental to
insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency proceedings during
applicable voidance periods. The administrator’s or the trustee’s right to challenge transactions can,
depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during the ten-year period prior to the filing of
the petition for commencement of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the holders of Senior Secured Notes as well as the granting of collateral for
or providing credit support for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes could be subject to potential
challenges by an insolvency administrator or, as the case may be, a trustee under the rules of avoidance
as set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the
Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees or any Collateral in favor of the Senior Secured Notes is
challenged successfully, the holder of the Senior Secured Notes may not be able to recover any amounts
under the Senior Secured Notes or the Guarantees or Collateral. If payments have already been made
under the Senior Secured Notes, the Guarantee or the Collateral, any amounts received from a
transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate. In this case,
holders of the Senior Secured Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Senior
Secured Notes or the Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also include the
granting of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

(i) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a)
during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency
proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the
creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)) at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency_
or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(ii) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was
not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such
creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last
month prior to the filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or
after such filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of
the petition and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental
to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest
such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as
described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such
transaction for other creditors;

(iii) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against
a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three


-----

months prior to the filing of the petition of the commencement of insolvency proceedings and
the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty
to such transaction knew of the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the
filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to
such transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at
the time of the transaction (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity_
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(iv) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected four years prior to the filing of the petition for
the commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(v) any act performed by the debtor during ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if the other party knew of such intention at the time of such
act with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew that the debtor’s illiquidity
was at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the transaction disadvantaged
the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to
obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled, such knowledge is (solely)
presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to
the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and
that the transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. Apart from that, such acts granting an
insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was granted or obtained in a form or at a time to
which or at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction), may only be
avoided if they were effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing. There is a rebuttable
presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement (Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the
creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred payment (Zahlungserleichterungen)
to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time
of the transaction;

(vi) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an
“affiliated party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than
two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the
time the contract was concluded;

(vii) any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung)
for a claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or a commercially equivalent claim
if (a) in the case of the granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the
filing of the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition, or (b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition. This does not apply (a) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest
and are not engaged in management and (b) until the sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige
_Sanierung) of the debtor in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over_
indebtedness, illiquidity or imminent illiquidity with the intension to restructure the debtor; and

(viii) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent
claim if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
commencement of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had


-----

granted security for such loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder
_Bürge) for such loan (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the_
amounts paid (subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the debtor (e.g., the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) was
unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency
creditors, as the case may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see—"Preventive
_Restructuring Framework") per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such_
“knowledge.” A person is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the
insolvency creditors if it knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced
the debtor’s creditors. If the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency
creditor to obtain, security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form
in which and at a time at which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente
_Deckungshandlung),_ the words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding
sentence have to be replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to
an “affiliated party" (nahestehende Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption
that such party had “knowledge” as indicated above.

In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.

The granting of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be
qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances
avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg) are restricted. According
to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however, this privilege
does not apply to claims as described under (vii) above.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see—"Preventive Restructuring
_Framework") are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige_
_Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete_
information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof.
This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral
provided therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended
existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor
if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating
such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings
(see—"Preventive Restructuring Framework") per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by
a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor
of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further
with respect thereto.

_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against
the debtor on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be
satisfied ranking behind the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according
to the proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued
on the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings;
(ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii)
fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal
consequences of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to
the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder
loan (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in commercial
terms to such a loan.

_Preventive Restructuring Framework_

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

Based on the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019
on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring
Directive”) the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January
1, 2021. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency
procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interest” is located in Germany.
This may apply to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer. Whether
companies which do not have their “centre of main interest” in Germany have access to such
restructuring proceedings is unanswered by German courts and debated in German legal literature.

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1,
2021, no long standing (court) practice exists as of the date of this offering memorandum and
consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come
with certain degree of uncertainty.

For the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of
restructuring proceedings by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or the Senior Notes Issuer
having its “centre of main interest” in Germany would be in particular the following:

- potentially no or limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

- any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes) with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called (cross-class) cram
down by other classes under certain presumptions;

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group Collateral may be subject to
restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective Collateral;
and

- if filed for by the relevant debtor, restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain
creditors regarding their claims, or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable
assets of up to eight months due to a moratorium.


-----

_Restructuring proceedings_

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the
competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. According to recent
case law, the managing directors of a limited liability company (GmbH) as e.g., the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, may require shareholder consent to file for restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible
to file for a restructuring plan to be sanctioned if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend
_zahlungsunfähig). Such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely_
than not that the debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due, in general, in the next
24 months.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager,
which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor
has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring
goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the
envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However,
if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly
without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the
restructuring courts discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the
backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors
or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the
enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the
achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once
restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to
file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the envisaged
restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or respective
collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or
essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the
settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring
officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by
the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved
by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/or
shareholders are to be compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter)
any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective
individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable
qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor,
creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an
Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—Moratorium"), or (ii) creditors of one
class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring
officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed
Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of
creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own
discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the
procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan (see “—Voting on the restructuring
_plan’’) and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business_
situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is
granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of


-----

such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of
such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the
proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
and restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties
independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory
restructuring officer.

The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex
officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted
independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an
optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan.
Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs
of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the
stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An
optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for
good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a
creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate
the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g., if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of
the occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account
the actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency
proceedings is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for
insolvency or insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s
filing.

Under German restructuring law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement, or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement,
upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings in respect of the other party or the usage of certain
instruments of restructuring proceedings may generally be invalid. This may also relate to agreements
that are not governed by German law.

_Restructuring plan_

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan, which can comprise certain
selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and claims based on
intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of financial and other
agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue
claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor
agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates,
e.g., the Senior Notes Issuer, (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted
under a restructuring plan, provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently,
the Senior Secured Notes or the relevant Guarantee could also be subject to a restructuring plan in any
case if the respective debtor has its “centre of main interest” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law
measures like a share-capital increase. Once restructuring proceedings are initiated, a debt-to-equity
swap can be implemented without shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain


-----

creditors to equitize their debt claims as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under
a restructuring plan. Hence, if the Senior Secured Notes or a Guarantee were subject to a restructuring
plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single holders of the Senior Secured Notes could not be forced
under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Guarantor without their
respective consent.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed
by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a
(virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the
respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors,
unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors
(e.g., shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings,
could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be
required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can
be crammed down (or up), if

(i) the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the plan than absent the plan
(whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent liquidation, but
can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

(ii) the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value
created by the plan; and

(iii) a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the plan if
(i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that would rank junior in
insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through the plan which is not
covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor that would rank pari
_passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the dissenting class under_
the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate (sachgerecht) in light of the
individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class accounts for no more than 50% of
the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described under (ii) in the foregoing sentence,
a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder retains equity without any additional
contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly committed to the continuation of the
debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or the creditors’ rights are only
compromised marginally (e.g., by a maturity extension of no more than 18 months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan.
In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected
stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the
procedure to adopt the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon
the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can
obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the
restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect
facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the
restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under
the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised
such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application
has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to
be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.


-----

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they
are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the
restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not
suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende
_Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and_
ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that
are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a
German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Proceedings Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding
in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. In any other case, the recognition of the
restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under applicable international private law.
As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1,
2021, any such recognition has not yet been court tested as of the date of this offering memorandum.

_Moratorium_

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by
the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain
or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over
moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months,
with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under
certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the
debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten).

The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors
may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated
insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in
particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not
comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

_Limitations on Enforcement_

The Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung—“GmbH”) and/or limited partnerships (Kommanditgesellschaft) with a_
limited liability company as its only general partner (“GmbH & Co. KG”). The granting of guarantees,
indemnities and security interests by these companies and partnerships for obligations of their affiliates
(other than their respective subsidiaries) is regarded as distribution and therefore subject to certain
provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (“GmbHG”) and other laws. These provisions would also apply to any future_
Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG.

_GmbH Limitation Language_

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s
net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German generally
accepted accounting principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated share capital
(Stammkapital). The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH in order to
guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company may be considered
disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to issue
guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company
without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market practice for indentures, certain


-----

credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to
subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal form of a GmbH or a limited
partnership with a GmbH as its only general partner. Pursuant to such limitation language, the
beneficiaries of the guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and
exemptions, to enforce the guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to
the extent that such enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a partnership with a
GmbH as general partner, such general partner’s) net assets falling below its stated share capital or, as
the case may be, if the net assets are already below the amount of its stated share capital, to cause such
amount to be further reduced. Accordingly, the Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Security Documents provided by the Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the
enforcement of the Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the
manner described. This could lead to a situation in which the respective Guarantee or security granted
by the relevant Guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

In addition, enforcement of the guarantees and security interests granted by a GmbH or GmbH & Co.
KG may be limited under its respective terms to the extent that it would lead to the illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) of the GmbH or of the general partner of a GmbH & Co. KG granting such
guarantee or security interest.

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG to be incorporated into the relevant Senior
Secured Notes Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, will substantially be in the form as follows:

(a) “The restrictions in this Clause shall apply to any guarantee, indemnity, liability and other
payment obligations under this Clause or any other provision in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and/or any other documents in connection therewith granted by a Guarantor
incorporated under the laws of Germany as a limited liability company (GmbH) (a “German
GmbH Guarantor”) to secure liabilities of its current or any future direct or indirect
shareholder(s) (upstream) or a subsidiary of such shareholder (but excluding any direct or
indirect subsidiary of such German GmbH Guarantor) (cross-stream) (a “Guarantee”).”

(b) The restrictions in this Clause shall not apply with respect to a Capital Impairment:

(i) to the extent the German GmbH Guarantor secures any indebtedness under any Senior
Secured Notes Documents in respect of (i) loans to the extent such loans are (directly
or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed on to the relevant German GmbH Guarantor
or its subsidiaries or (ii) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the
benefit of any of the creditors of the German GmbH Guarantor or the German GmbH
Guarantor’s subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent that any such on-lending or
otherwise passing on or bank guarantees or letters of credit are still outstanding at the
time of the enforcement of the Guarantee; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
paragraph (b) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple
times (no double dip);

(ii) if, at the time of enforcement of the Guarantee, a domination and/or profit and loss
pooling agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) as per §291
of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz, AktG) (either directly or indirectly
through an unbroken chain of domination and/or profit transfer agreements) exists
between the relevant German GmbH Guarantor as a dominated company (beherrschtes
_Unternehmen), and:_

(A) in case that German GmbH Guarantor is a subsidiary of the relevant obligor
whose obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee, that obligor; or

(B) in case the German GmbH Guarantor and the relevant obligor whose
obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee are both subsidiaries of a


-----

joint (direct or indirect) parent company, such parent company as dominating
entity (beherrschendes Unternehmen),

to the extent the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss pooling
agreement (Beherrschungs- und/oder Gewinnabführungsvertrag) leads to the full
inapplicability of section 30 paragraph 1 sentence 1 of the German Limited Liabilities
Company Act (GmbHG);

(iii) to the extent any payment under the Guarantee demanded by the Trustee from the
relevant German GmbH Guarantor is covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and
recoverable consideration or recourse claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder
_Rückgewähranspruch) of the German GmbH Guarantor against the affiliate whose_
obligations are secured by the relevant Guarantee; or

(iv) if the relevant German GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant
to paragraphs (d) and (e) below. However, if and to the extent that the Guarantee has
been enforced without regard to the restrictions contained in this Clause because the
Management Notification (as defined below) and/or the Auditor’s Determination (as
defined below) has not (or not in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to
paragraphs (d) and (e) below, but the Auditor’s Determination has then been delivered
within four months from its due date in accordance with paragraph (e) below, the
Trustee shall upon demand of the German GmbH Guarantor to the Trustee repay any
amount received from the German GmbH Guarantor which pursuant to the Auditor’s
Determination would not have been available for enforcement, if the Auditor’s
Determination had been delivered in a timely manner.

(c) The parties to this Agreement agree that if payment under the Guarantee would cause (i) the
amount of a German GmbH Guarantor’s Net Assets (as defined below), as calculated and
defined pursuant to paragraph (g) below, to fall below the amount required to maintain its
registered share capital (Stammkapital) or increase an existing shortage (Vertiefung einer
_Unterbilanz) of its registered share capital (Stammkapital) and thereby violating §§ 30, 31_
GmbHG (such event, a “Capital Impairment”), or (ii) a German GmbH Guarantor to be
deprived of the liquidity necessary to fulfill its liabilities towards its creditors (such event, a
“Liquidity Impairment”) then the Trustee shall not enforce and the German GmbH Guarantor
shall, subject to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, have a defense (Einrede) against any claim under
the Guarantee if and to the extent such Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would
occur.

(d) If the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee in writing (Textform,
§126b BGB) (the “Management Notification”) within fifteen (15) business days after the
making of a demand against that German GmbH Guarantor under the Guarantee:

(i) to what extent such Guarantee is an upstream or cross-stream guarantee or indemnity;
and

(ii) to what extent a Capital Impairment or Liquidity Impairment would occur as a result
of an enforcement of the Guarantee (setting out in reasonable detail the amount of its
Net Assets or to which extent the liquidity would be deprived, providing an up-to-date
_pro forma balance sheet or liquidity statement),_

then the restrictions set out in this Clause shall cease to apply until a Management Notification
has been provided.

(e) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty (20) business
days of its receipt, request the relevant German GmbH Guarantor to provide to the Trustee
within forty-five (45) business days of receipt of such request a determination by the auditors


-----

or any other auditors of international standard and reputation (the “Auditor’s Determination”)
appointed by the German GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in
reasonable detail the amount in which the payment under the Guarantee would cause a Capital
Impairment or Liquidity Impairment, subject to the terms set out under this Clause. Save for
manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(f) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from
demanding any or only partial payment under the Guarantee or obliged it to surrender any part
of the enforcement proceeds, the Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions
of the German GmbH Guarantor as set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially
improved, the Trustee may (acting reasonably), at the German GmbH Guarantor’s cost and
expense, arrange for the preparation of an updated balance sheet of the German GmbH
Guarantor by applying the same principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s
Determination by the auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such
auditors to determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment and Liquidity
Impairment has been cured as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the
German GmbH Guarantor. The Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s
Determination prior to the expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding
Auditor’s Determination. The Trustee may only enforce or demand payment under the
Guarantee to the extent the auditors determine that the Capital Impairment and Liquidity
Impairment have been cured.

(g) The net assets (Reinvermögen) of the German GmbH Guarantor (the “Net Assets”) shall be
calculated in accordance with § 42 GmbHG, §§ 242, 264 of the German Commercial Code
(Handelsgesetzbuch, HGB) and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable from
time to time in Germany (Grundsätze ordnungsgemäßer Buchführung) and for the purposes of
calculating the Net Assets, the following balance sheet items shall be adjusted as follows:

(i) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant German GmbH
Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant German GmbH Guarantor became
a party to this Agreement and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus
_Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share capital_
(Stammkapital) of the relevant German GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly prohibited
under the Senior Secured Notes Documents and has been carried out without the prior
written consent of the Trustee;

(ii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 253 subsection 6 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) shall not be included in the calculation
of Net Assets;

(iii) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 268 sub-section 8 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) shall not be included in the calculation
of Net Assets;

(iv) the amount of non-distributable assets according to Section 272 sub-section 5 of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) shall not be included in the calculation
of Net Assets; and

(v) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant German GmbH Guarantor in willful
or grossly negligent violation of the Senior Secured Notes Documents shall not be
taken into account as liabilities.

(h) Where a German GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this Clause that
the Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall (A) realize, to the extent lawful
and commercially justifiable, any and all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with
a carrying amount (Buchwert) that is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and


-----

are not necessary (betriebsnotwendig) for the relevant German GmbH Guarantor’s business,
and (B) use best efforts to realize, to the extent legally permitted in a situation where it does
not have sufficient liquidity to fulfill its liabilities to its creditors, any and all of its assets if the
relevant asset is not necessary for the German GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht
_betriebsnotwendig)._

(i) Nothing in this Clause shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this
Agreement or any other Senior Secured Notes Document to the Trustee or any holders of the
Senior Secured Notes or vice versa.

(j) Nothing in this Clause shall prevent the Trustee or a German GmbH Guarantor from claiming
in court that the provision of this Guarantee and/or making payments under this Guarantee by
the relevant German GmbH Guarantor does or does not fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31 and/or
§ 15b(5) of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) and/or § 826 German Civil Code
(Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch).

(k) In addition to the restrictions set out in this Clause, if a German GmbH Guarantor demonstrates
that, according to the decisions of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or
a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht), the enforcement of any upstream or
cross-stream guarantee or security interest against such German GmbH Guarantor would result
in personal liability of its managing director(s) (Geschäftsführer) for a reimbursement of
payments made under the Guarantee (including pursuant to § 826 of the German Civil Code
(Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch)), the German GmbH Guarantor shall have a defense (Einrede)
against the Guarantee to the extent required in order not to incur such liability.

(l) The provisions of this Clause shall apply to a limited partnership with a limited liability
company as its general partner (GmbH & Co. KG) mutatis mutandis and all references to
Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets shall be construed as a reference to
the Capital Impairment, Liquidity Impairment and Net Assets of the general partner
(Komplementär) of the German GmbH Guarantor.

(m) For the purposes of this Clause, a reference to a “German GmbH Guarantor” includes any
limited liability company incorporated (or limited partnership with a limited liability company
as its general partner) in a jurisdiction other than Germany whose centre of main interest (as
that term is used in Article 3(1) of The Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament
and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on Insolvency Proceedings) is in Germany.

(n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, this Clause
and any rights and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, German law.”

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with
respect to Sections 30, 31 and § 15b(5) of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)), are subject
to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court rulings may not further limit the access of
shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in the form of, as applicable, a GmbH or GmbH &
Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Guarantors to make payments on the Senior
Secured Notes or the Guarantees or the enforceability of the Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation
in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment
obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or other collateral
granted by the Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement
process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of


-----

contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the
debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of its other business
partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with respect to the granting
of the Guarantee or any Collateral by the Guarantors.

Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Senior Secured Notes) of a transaction qualifying
as a repayment of the stated share capital of grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable
(for example, the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest) could moreover
become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the
intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the
legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of
the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider
of security interest is close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect
thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the
secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claims is settled, discharged or novated,
and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the
relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of the Senior Secured Notes from time to time will not
be party to the Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Senior Secured Notes from
time to time to benefit from pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor
Agreement will provide for the creation of a parallel debt. Pursuant to the creation of the parallel debt,
the Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each
obligor under, in particular, the Senior Secured Notes. The pledges governed by German law will
directly and exclusively (to the extent the Senior Secured Notes are concerned) secure the parallel debt
rather than the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes
directly. The validity of the parallel debt concept and of the pledges granted under German law to secure
such parallel debt has not been tested before German courts, and there is no certainty that it will
eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by German law. Therefore, the ability of the
Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the Senior Secured
Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes.”

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the
sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction
(öffentliche Versteigerung) to which certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under
German law, it is unclear whether the security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the
right to prevent other creditors of the entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and
realizing the asset constituting the collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security
interests only give their holders priority (according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds
from the realization of the asset constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (i.e., the right to
request the court to impose a stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
as of the date of the final Offering Memorandum, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to
each Initial Purchaser and each such Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase
the entire principle amount of the Senior Secured Notes from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal
opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes initially at the price indicated on the
cover of this Offering Memorandum. After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms
of the Senior Secured Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice.
Offers and sales of the Senior Secured Notes in the United States will be made by those Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates or through United States-registered broker dealers. To the extent that such
Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Senior Secured Notes in the United States, they will do
so only through one or more US-registered broker-dealers under the U.S. Exchange Act, or in
accordance with Rule 15a-6 thereunder. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or
modify offers to prospective investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

In connection with the Offering, we have agreed to pay certain customary fees and/or reimburse the
Initial Purchasers for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp
duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in
addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to
payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject
to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as
provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, us during the period
from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date 30 days after the date of the
Purchase Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S.
Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Senior Secured
Notes (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in accordance with Rule 144A and (ii)
outside the United States in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Rule 144A and Regulation S.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause
to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the
Senior Secured Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors.; and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to
anything done by it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or otherwise involving the
United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by
us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Senior Secured Notes or the


-----

possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to
us or the Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required.
Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither
this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisement in connection with the
Senior Secured Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in
compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering
Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any
jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this
Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Senior Secured
Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Senior Secured Notes are new issues of securities for which there currently is no market.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the Senior Secured Notes
as permitted by applicable law after completing the Offering. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated,
however, to make a market in the Senior Secured Notes, and any market-making activity may be
discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any
such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the
U.S. Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the Senior Secured Notes will develop,
that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Senior Secured Notes at a
particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Senior Secured Notes—There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in_
_which case your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made against payment on the Senior
Secured Notes on or around the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which
will be         business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange
Act) following the date of pricing of the Senior Secured Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred
to as “T+  ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally
are required to settle in two business days (until the end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle
of T+1 on May 28, 2024), unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or
the next          business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time
of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to
make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Senior Secured Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Senior
Secured Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Senior Secured Notes. The Stabilizing
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate
short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and
purchase Senior Secured Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and
regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the
Senior Secured Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not
required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no
assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes—There may not be an active trading market for_
_the Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Senior Secured Notes will be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial banking, investment banking, financial
advising, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.


-----

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may
provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its affiliates (including the Sponsor) in the ordinary course of business
for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In particular, some of
the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have from time to time provided and may continue to provide
M&A and capital markets services to the Sponsor in connection with its interests in the Group.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Senior Secured Notes. In
addition, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold 2% Notes due 2025, which are subject to the
Tender Offer described under “Summary—The Transactions—Concurrent Tender Offer” and therefore
they may tender (and receive consideration for) such Tendered 2% Notes due 2025 pursuant to the terms
of the Tender Offer or otherwise receive payment in connection with the redemption of the Remaining
2% Notes due 2025, in each case funded with the net proceeds of the Offering. Goldman Sachs Bank
Europe SE is acting as dealer manager in connection with the Tender Offer. Certain of the Initial
Purchasers and/or their affiliates may also enter into hedging arrangements with us in connection with
the Transactions or otherwise.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers (or their respective affiliates) are lenders under the Senior Facilities. In
addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates act as mandated lead arranger
and/or lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement and as arranger and bookrunner of the Senior
Facilities Extension and Upsize. Credit Suisse AG, London Branch also acts as facility agent under the
Senior Facilities Agreement. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may receive
customary fees and expense reimbursements in connection with such roles.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts
of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and instruments of
us or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us, they
routinely hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies.
Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in our securities, which may include the Senior Secured Notes. Any such positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
also make investment recommendations and publish or express independent research views in respect
of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and short positions in such securities and instruments.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is organized under the laws of Germany. The Security Documents
relating to the Collateral will be governed by the laws of Germany. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes (including the Guarantees) will be governed by New York
law. The Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Facilities Agreement are governed by the laws of
England and Wales. All of the directors and executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
each of the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Since substantially all of the assets of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Guarantors, and its and their directors and executive
officers, are located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against either
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or any such other person, including judgments with
respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the Senior Secured Notes or any
judgment of a U.S. court predicated upon civil liabilities under U.S. federal or state securities laws, may
not be collectible in the United States. Furthermore, although the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each
of the Guarantors will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to
the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be
possible for investors to effect service of process on us or on such other persons mentioned above within
the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S.
federal securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against either of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor,
or the Senior Notes Issuer, as a security provider, investors will need to enforce such judgment in
jurisdictions where the relevant company has assets. Even though the enforceability of U.S. court
judgments outside the United States is described below for Germany, where the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and each of the Guarantors is located, you should consult with your own advisors in any pertinent
jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

**Germany**

There is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state
securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal
or state courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the
reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment,
whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be
enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal or state court, however, may be recognized
and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action,
a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S.
court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a German court
would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following (pursuant to section 328(1) of
the German Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung)):

- the judgment being final under U.S. federal or state law;

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

- the document introducing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant
in a timely manner that allowed for adequate defense and the defendant having had the chance
to defend herself or himself against an unduly or untimely served complaint;

- the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the judgment of a German court or a
recognized judgment of a foreign court handed down before the judgment of the U.S. court;


-----

- the matter (Verfahren) resulting in the judgment of the U.S. court being consistent with the
matter (Verfahren) pending before a German court, provided that such German matter was
pending before a German court prior to the U.S. court entered its judgment;

- the enforcement of the judgment by the U.S. court being compatible with the substantial
foundations of German law (ordre public), in particular with the civil liberties (Grundrechte)
guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); and

- generally, the guarantee of reciprocity.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and
commercial matters obtained from U.S. courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that
attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

German courts usually deny the recognition and enforcement of penal or punitive damages (as
incompatible with the essential principles of German law). Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. Consequently, judgments awarding monetary
damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws may not be enforceable to
the extent they provide for a compensation that would qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. Insofar
as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based
on common law provide for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior
to trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses.
Evidence obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No equivalent
pretrial discovery process exists under German law.

There is some German case law to the effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured
in relation to claims relating to assets (vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S.
states. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be
successful. It is also doubtful whether a German court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil
liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S. federal securities laws.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors or those persons under
the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial
Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were
deemed to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the
fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue
of the German constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before
the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

This Financial Report contains interim consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three-month
period ended December 31, 2023. It does not provide all of the information and disclosures included in complete
consolidated financial statements and is therefore to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements for the financial year ended September 30, 2023. The Company does prepare financial statements on
a going concern basis.

The Interim Report has been prepared in compliance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’. The accounting
policies applied to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are generally based on the same
accounting policies used in the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ending September 30,
2023.

In addition to the financial year ending September 30, 2023, earnings per share are calculated by dividing the
consolidated net income after tax, which can be attributed to the owners of the Techem 671 Group, by the
weighted average number of shares outstanding during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated
on the assumption that all potentially dilutive securities and share-based compensation plans are converted or
exercised.

For further information on new accounting standards and interpretations as well as on amendments to issued
standards, please refer to the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended September 30, 2023.

The application of the following amendments and standards is mandatory for the Company since October 1, 2023:

  Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes: International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules

  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements – Disclosure of Accounting Policies

  Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors – Definition of
Accounting Estimates

  Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single
Transaction

  IFRS 17: Insurance Contracts

  Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts - Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9: Comparative
Information


-----

The amendments and standards mentioned above will have no or no significant impact on the financial statements
of the Company.

The following amendments have been endorsed since September 30, 2023, in addition to those disclosed in the
consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended September 30, 2023:

  Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements:

`o` Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;
`o` Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date and
`o` Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (issued on 31 October 2022)

The preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income, expense and contingent liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The judgments,
estimates and assumptions were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended September 30, 2023. The results obtained thus far in the current financial year are not necessarily an indication
of how business will develop in the future. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future
periods affected.

The income tax expense for the reporting period was determined on the basis of the tax rate expected to apply to
the full financial year. In addition to our disclosures in accordance with IAS 12 in our consolidated financial statements
as at September 30, 2023, the Minimum Taxation Directive Implementation Act came into force in Germany. This
has not changed our risk assessment. Thus, there is currently no risk for Techem.

The financial statements are presented in Euro, which is the Company’s functional currency. All financial information
presented in Euro has been rounded to the nearest thousand.

**Changes to the scope of consolidation**

During the first three month in the financial year 2024 the Company made the following changes to the basis of
consolidation:

  Effective October 6, 2023, all the shares in Techem Energy Services LLC, Dubai/United Arab Emirates
were sold.

  Effective October 6, 2023, all the shares in aqua calor GmbH, Leipzig/Germany were acquired.

  Effective October 6, 2023, all the shares in meine Wärme GmbH, Leipzig/Germany were acquired.

#### ▪
Effective October 6, 2023, all the shares in SAS DEVADER COMPTEURS, Cagnes-sur-Mer/France were
acquired.

  Effective December 8, 2023, all the shares in UNI-PLUS Hettel GmbH Wasser&Wärmemessen&abrechnen, Muggensturm/Germany were acquired.

**Currency translation. The functional currency of each subsidiary is its local currency. As a result, financial**
information from foreign subsidiaries is translated to Euros as follows: balance sheet figures are translated at the
middle rates on the balance sheet date, equity is translated at the historical rates, and profit or loss figures are
translated at average rates for the financial year. Currency translation gains or losses are recognized directly in
other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the
transaction date. Gains and losses resulting from such transactions and from the translation at the closing rate of
monetary assets and liabilities managed in foreign currency are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

**Explanation of variations in terms of IAS 34 relating to the statement of financial position and the**
**statement of profit or loss**

**Cash and cash equivalents increased by €70,956 thousand to €105,485 thousand compared to September 30,**
2023. This is mainly driven by the increase and drawing of the Revolving Credit Facility of €110,000 thousand to
€130,000 thousand in three-month-period ended December 31, 2023 compared to September 30, 2023.
Additionally, in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, net cash amounting to €11,381 thousand was


-----

generated by operating activities after taxes. The cash-inflow was offset by cash-outflows from investing activities,
mainly relating to the purchase of fixed and intangible assets amounting to €34,150 thousand, the acquisition of
subsidiaries amounting to €10,392 thousand (net of cash acquired).

**Contract liabilities (current) are €29,932 thousand below September 30, 2023. The reduction in contract**
liabilities represents their release to revenue in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023. It mainly
results from the deferral of the revenue from rental and maintenance services as well as reading and billing
services in the Energy Services business, for which the payments received from the customer exceed the
services rendered by the Company.

**Liabilities to shareholders (current) increased by €26,467 thousand compared to September 30, 2023. The**
increase is due to accrued interest liabilities for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, which result
from a loan agreement between Luxembourg Investment Company 261 S.à r.l. and Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 672 mbH dated July 26, 2018.

**Financial Liabilities** **(current)** increased by €139,817 thousand compared to September 30, 2023, mainly due to
drawing of the Revolving Credit Facility in an amount of €110,000 thousand for the three-month period ended
December 31, 2023 and an increase in accrued interest on Facility B of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes totaling €29,556 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31,
2023.

**Product expenses and purchased services decreased by €13,871 thousand in the three-month period ended**
December 31, 2023 to €56,695 thousand mainly due to a decline in the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions. Due
to the impending gas shortage in the 2nd half of 2022, we procured quantities for winter 2022/23 early. However,
the forward prices were very high, so the procurement costs in three-month period ended December 31, 2022
were much higher compared to the procurement costs in three-month period ended December 31, 2023.

**Financial income increased to €1,315 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from €881**
thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. In the three-month period ended December 31,
2023 financial income mainly included exchange gains on loans to related entities of €416 thousand (three-month
period ended December 31, 2022: €628 thousand) and a gain resulting from foreign exchange hedges amounting
to €355 thousand (loss in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022: €110 thousand).

**Finance costs increased to €63,304 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from €50,051**
thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. These costs mainly include interest expenses,
which amounted to €62,533 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to €49,562
thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. Third party interest expenses increased to
€36,065 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from €24,613 thousand in the threemonth period ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the higher interest rate level on the capital markets.
Interest expenses on transactions with related entities increased to €26,467 thousand in the three-month period
ended December 31, 2023 compared to €24,950 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.
The increase in interest expenses on transactions with related entities was due to the capitalization of unpaid
interest amounting to € 98,984 thousand as at March 31, 2023.

**Income tax expenses decreased to €596 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from**
€1,807 thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022. This results from deferred tax income
which decreased by €2,328 thousand, mainly resulting from the Energy Services Germany segment. Additionally,
current income tax expenses decreased by €1,117 thousand, mainly due to the decreased taxable income of the
German tax group, which leads to €1,532 thousand less current income taxes in this period. In contrast, the
taxable income of the ESI segment increased, which leads to €395 thousand more current income taxes in the
three-month period ended December 31, 2023 compared to the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.

**Other comprehensive income that is not recycled through the statement of profit or loss increased to €720**
thousand in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 from €0 thousand in the three-month period ended
December 31, 2022 which mainly results from the remeasurements of provisions for pensions due to the change
in interest rates.

**Financial Instruments**

Financial assets only contain debt instruments. According to the “SPPI test”, the financial assets generate cash
flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Furthermore, according to the “Business model test”


-----

these financial instruments’ cash flows solely result from collecting contractual cash flows (IFRS 9.4.1.2).
Therefore, the financial assets are recorded at amortized costs.

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value by fair value hierarchy in accordance with
IFRS 7 and IFRS 13. The different levels have been defined as follows:

level 1: financial instruments traded in active markets for which unchanged quoted prices are taken as

measurement
level 2: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters derived directly or indirectly from

observable market data
level 3: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters that are not based on observable

market data

For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, no transfers between Level 1 and 2 of the fair value
hierarchy occurred in the three-month period ended December 31,2023.


-----

It is assumed that the fair values of all current items are approximately equivalent to their carrying amounts. The
main reason for this is the short maturity of these instruments.

For non-current other financial assets, non-current trade accounts payable and non-current other financial liabilities
the carrying amounts are approximately equivalent to their fair values.

As at December 31,2023, the fair values of hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting (interest rate
caps) are determined based on the difference between the variable interest rate agreed as part of the underlying
transaction and the interest rate limited by the cap.

The fair values of the Notes are their respective quoted market prices as at December 31, 2023.

The fair value of non-current financial liabilities (loans), measured at amortized cost, is determined using the
discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rates
used are term adequate risk-adjusted discount rates. The risk adjustment is made based on the CDS spreads of
Techem.

The fair value of non-current liabilities to shareholders, measured at amortized cost, is determined using the
discounted cash flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rate used
is the internal rate of return of Techem Senior Notes as at December 31, 2023.

The respective fair values of the Notes mentioned above fall into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The
aforementioned fair values of the non-current financial liabilities (excluding the Notes) and non-current liabilities to
shareholders are attributed to Level 2.

**Earnings per share**

The consolidated net income/loss in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 attributable to the owners of the
Techem 671 Group amounted to € (48,622) thousand (in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023: € (37,848)
thousand) is the basis for the calculation of both diluted and undiluted earnings. There was no dilution effect in the three-month
period ended December 31, 2023 or in the three-month period ended December 31, 2022.

**Segment reporting**

The segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments is prepared due to the issuance of Notes in
July 2018 by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH and the issuance of Notes in January 2020 by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH which are traded in a public market. Both companies are indirect subsidiaries of
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH. The quarterly segment reporting does not provide all of the
information and is therefore to be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the financial
year ended September 30, 2023

Within the segment Energy Services, the Company provides its customers, which mainly comprise service
providers in the housing and real-estate industry, with measurement, sub-meter reading and billing services
relating to energy and water consumption. The reading and billing services are subject to seasonal fluctuations,
which impact the results of operations accordingly.

The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions represents a further development of our previous segment Energy
Contracting. The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions provides its customers with services in relation to the
planning, financing, construction and operation of heat generation plants. The plants are maintained continuously.
Gas, oil, long-distance heating and electricity are provided to the customers. In the short financial year 2020, the
business unit water technology, which comprises the professional operation of water treatment facilities, was
transferred from the segment Energy Services to the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions.

Consolidation entries are included under "Other".

The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied for the Group. The economic development of the
Group and its segments is managed by means of financial ratios. The financial ratios relevant to the management
are revenue and EBIT/EBITDA, whereby the company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the
business best.

**Acquisitions**

In the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, all the shares in the following companies were acquired:

#### ▪
aqua calor GmbH, Leipzig/Germany

#### ▪
meine Wärme GmbH, Leipzig/Germany

  SAS DEVADER COMPTEURS, Cagnes-sur-Mer/France, (hereinafter also referred to as “DEVADER”)

#### ▪
UNI-PLUS Hettel GmbH Wasser&Wärme-messen&abrechnen, Muggensturm/Germany, (hereinafter also
referred to as “ UNI-PLUS”)

The main intention regarding the acquisition is to strengthen the core business at the local level. The business of
the acquisition primarily comprises the reading and consumption-based billing of energy and water consumption as
well as the rental and the sale of the respective devices.

At the time the financial statements are issued, the group had not yet completed the accounting for the acquisition
of DEVADER and UNI-PLUS. In particular, the fair values of the assets and liabilities mentioned below have only
been determined provisionally as the valuations have not been finalized. It is also not yet possible to provide
detailed information about each class of acquired receivables and any contingent liabilities of the acquired entity.

The following table shows the total purchase price and the net cash outflow relating to the above acquisitions:

1) including trade receivables (gross) of €383 thousand and allowances for these trade receivables of €41 thousand. The book value of these receivables corresponds
to their fair value.

The goodwill of €8,192 thousand mainly comprises intangible assets, which cannot be identified separately and
mainly reflects expected future growth of earnings as a result of synergies and the increase in the market share in
the respective region. It is not tax-deductible.

If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of the Techem 671 Group since October 1, 2023, Group
revenues would have amounted to €211,551 thousand and Group net loss to €48,564 thousand. Since joining the
Group, the acquisitions generated total revenues of €401 thousand and total net income of €85 thousand in the
reporting period.

Costs directly attributable to the acquisitions amounted to €144 thousand, which were recognized in other
expenses.

**Other financial obligations / Financial guarantees**

As at December 31, 2023, other financial obligations amounted to €52,483 thousand. The amount contained
financial obligations related to the purchase of fixed assets and intangible assets of €17,828 thousand and financial

income in the amount of €285 thousand was incurred relating to the granted loan.

**Events after the balance sheet date**

Effective January 4, 2024, we acquired all the shares in BFW Dieter Ritter GmbH, Wyhl am Kaiserstuhl/Germany.
The main intention regarding these acquisitions is to strengthen the core business at local level. The business of
the acquired target primarily comprises the reading and consumption-based billing of energy and water
consumption as well as the rental and the sale of the respective devices. Considerations of approx. €35 million
were paid in cash. Because the initial accounting for this business combination has not been completed due to the
late closing, only preliminary disclosures about the acquired assets and liabilities can be made. Significant assets
acquired relate to goodwill and customer relationships. Besides this cash and cash equivalents of approximately €6
million, fixed assets of approximately €1 million and no significant liabilities were acquired.

Currently, the Revolving Credit Facility is utilized with €70,000 thousand in cash (December 31, 2023: €130,000
thousand).

**B.** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Techem 671 mbH and its subsidiaries. As in
previous years, the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements is 30. September.

The consolidated financial statements of Techem 671 Group for the year ended September 30, 2023 have been prepared in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) as adopted by the European Union (EU). In addition, the supplementary regulations in accordance with section 315(e)
German Commercial Code have been applied. In accordance with IFRS, the consolidated financial statements have generally
been prepared using the historical cost measurement basis. In line with IFRS, a different basis has been used in the
measurement of purchase price allocations, money market funds, financial instruments, leases, provisions for pensions and
other post-employment benefits.

The measurement of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the relevant balance sheet
dates, as well as the amount of income and expenses for the period under review, are influenced by estimates and
assumptions made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Although these
estimates and assumptions have been made with the best knowledge of the management of the Company (specifically in the
case of accrued revenues, provisions and intangible assets), actual figures may ultimately vary from these estimates.

Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are shown in thousands of Euros (€ thousand). Rounding may lead to discrepancies of ±
one unit in the tables.

All standards of the IASB and all the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC), which have to be applied in the EU, that were subject to mandatory application as at September 30, 2023, have been
applied by the Company in its consolidated financial statements.

**C.** **ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Principles of consolidation. Techem 671 mbH and all German and non-German subsidiaries which can be controlled directly**
or indirectly by Techem 671 mbH are included in the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are all entities which are
controlled by the Techem 671 Group. The Techem 671 Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, when it is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power over the
entity to affect the amount of the variable returns.

Investments in associates over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method.

All single-entity financial statements fully consolidated into the Techem 671 Group are prepared in accordance with uniform
accounting policies.

Subsidiaries acquired by the Company are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition costs are equivalent
to the fair value of the assets given up on the date of acquisition. For each business combination the assets, liabilities and
contingent liabilities identified as part of the business combination are measured at their fair values on the date of
acquisition regardless of the extent of the non-controlling interest. The excess of acquisition costs over the Group’s share in
the fair value of the net assets is recognized as goodwill. If the Group’s share in the fair value of the net assets exceeds the
acquisition cost, the remaining excess from a bargain purchase is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Costs directly
attributable to the acquisition are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

When the Group sells shares in a subsidiary and ceases to have control, the difference between the book value of the
subsidiary (from a Group perspective) and the disposal proceeds (after deducting costs of disposal) are recognized in the
statement of profit or loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income relating to the
subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

Consolidation of an entity begins on the date on which control over the entity is obtained by the Company. It ceases when
the Group loses that control.

All intercompany gains and losses, revenue, income and expenses, loans, receivables and payables, provisions, contingent
liabilities and other financial obligations are eliminated. Deferred taxes are recognized using the liabilities method for all
temporary differences between the assets and liabilities tax bases and their carrying amounts.

**Currency translation. The functional currency of each subsidiary is its local currency. As a result, financial information from**
foreign subsidiaries is translated to Euros as follows: balance sheet figures are translated at the middle rates on the balance
sheet date, equity is translated at the historical rates, and profit or loss figures are translated at average rates for the
financial year. Currency translation gains or losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the transaction date.
Gains and losses resulting from such transactions and from the translation at the closing rate of monetary assets and
liabilities managed in foreign currency are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.


-----

**D.** **ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The balance sheet items are broken down into current and non-current items, non-current items being items for which the
maturity is expected to exceed twelve months.

**Cash and cash equivalents. The Company deems all highly liquid financial investments with an original maturity of up to**
three months to be cash equivalents. These cash equivalents are primarily favorable bank balances realizable at short notice.
Additionally, money market funds are included in cash equivalents. These are recognized at fair value through profit or loss
(market value), as the “contractual cash flow characteristics test” according to IFRS 9 fails. Gains and losses are recognized in
the statement of profit or loss as financial income or finance costs when they are incurred. For cash and cash equivalents, a
valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in accordance with the General Approach of IFRS 9.

**Trade accounts receivable, contract assets, other assets and other financial assets. Current and non-current receivables**
(trade accounts receivable, other assets and other financial assets) and contract assets are measured at fair value on the date
of recognition and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method (including receivables from
installment-based business). The Group applies the Simplified Approach according to IFRS 9 for the calculation of expected
credit losses. Therefore, billed trade accounts receivable, finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables are subject to
allowances for expected credit losses over their entire term. To determine the expected credit losses and incurred losses
trade accounts receivable are arranged into groups based on their maturity and are appropriately impaired based on their
age. Contractual assets are recognized in the amount of the right to consideration for services already rendered.

Most of the Company’s installment-based business is in Eastern Europe. The receivables from installment-based business are
recognized at their present values.

The Group enters into finance leases as lessor. These leases are primarily leases of heat generation plants and other
machinery. To account for these leases, the Company recognizes a receivable equal to the present value of the minimum
lease payments. Payments by the lessee are treated as repayment of principal and financial income.

Costs to fulfill a contract result from costs accrued in order to align them with the corresponding recognition of revenue for
certain products. The costs to fulfill a contract are recognized as other assets. These are amortized over the contract term
and released in the statement of profit or loss into product expenses and purchased services.

**Inventories. Inventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined**
mainly on the basis of a weighted average. Potential losses resulting from obsolete or non-saleable inventories are accounted
for by means of appropriate write-downs.

**Metering and other devices and property, plant and equipment. Metering and other devices comprise devices, which are**
used in the rental business (including, for example, heat cost allocators, water meters, heat meters, smoke detectors and
other devices, which are installed on the customers’ premises and used as means for the provision of Techem billing
services), devices transferred for use and own tools. Metering and other devices are recognized at cost plus installation costs
reduced by depreciation in accordance with IAS 16.

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost reduced by depreciation. Gains or losses on the disposal of property,
plant and equipment are recognized as other income or other expenses.

Any subsidies received are deducted from the cost of the property, plant and equipment concerned and are recognized over
the useful life of the related asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.


-----

The estimated useful lives used as the basis for straight-line depreciation (pro rata temporis) are as follows:

**Estimated useful**
**life (years)**

Metering and other devices ................................................................................................................................ 6 to 18
Office furniture and equipment, machinery ....................................................................................................... 2 to 23
Buildings .............................................................................................................................................................. 18 to 50
Leasehold improvements .................................................................................................................................... 2 to 20
(or shorter
lease term)

If a customer acquires, by corresponding payment, legal title of the metering and other devices when cancelling the rental
contract, resulting gains or losses on this disposal are accounted for as other income or other expenses.

Compensatory payments made by the customer when cancelling the rental contract are recognized as other income, if the
legal title of the metering and other devices is not transferred to the customer. Provided that the Company does not have
any alternative use for the metering devices, their residual values are impaired.

**Intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost.**

If the requirements under IAS 38 are satisfied, internally generated intangible assets are also recognized at cost. The costs of
internally generated intangible assets mainly include, depending on the project, capitalized own work of employees and the
costs of the support by external partners. These mainly result from the implementation, conception, test and project
organization phases of the projects.

Intangible assets are primarily amortized on a straight-line basis (pro rata temporis) over the following useful lives:

**Estimated useful**
**life (years)**

Software, licenses and technology ...................................................................................................................... 2 to 24
Customer relationships/customer agreements .................................................................................................. 25 to 50
Costs to obtain a contract ................................................................................................................................... approx. 4 to 15
Other trademarks ................................................................................................................................................ 3 to 15

In the final year 2021/2022, the useful lives of customer relationships were increased from 24 years in the ESI segment and
22 years in the ESG segment to 40 years in both segments. The increase is due to the sustained decline in the churn rate
(decline in the number of devices in the reporting period on the basis of existing business) In the EES segment, the useful life
was increased from 13 to 25 years.

The classification of the trademark Techem as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is based on the fact that
Techem has existed as a trademark since 1952. Brand awareness of Techem is very high in the market and Techem does not
plan to abandon this trademark. This classification is verified once a year.

Costs to obtain a contract result from variable remuneration of internal staff and from sales or agency commissions to third
parties in connection with the conclusion of customer contracts. The costs to obtain a contract are recognized as intangible
asset and presented in a separate asset category in the Group financial statements. The costs are amortized on a straightline-basis over the minimum contract term. For contracts that can be terminated by the customer without penalty at any
time, the contract term explicitly stated in the contract is considered the minimum contract term in that context.

**Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases where the Group is the lessee are recognized as a right-of-use asset and**
corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is
allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period to produce
a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. Assets and liabilities arising
from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate
implicit in the lease if that rate can be determined or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate


-----

Payments relating to short-term leases of machinery, where the Group is the lessee, are recognized as an expense in the
statement of profit or loss.

**Recoverability of non-current assets. Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, including intangible**
assets, are tested for impairment as soon as events highlight, or there are indicators, that the carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its recoverable amount, the recoverable amount being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or the value in
use of the asset concerned. The value in use is defined as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be derived from
an asset or a cash generating unit (CGU). In accordance with IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the price that would be
received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. For the purposes of
determining an impairment, assets are grouped together into the smallest group for which separate cash flows can be
identified.

Goodwill, trademark Techem as well as software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an impairment
test at least once a year and are not subject to straight-line amortization. The impairment test is carried out for groups of
CGUs. Goodwill, the trademark Techem as well as software in development are measured at their original cost less any
accumulated impairment. Impairment losses recognized for goodwill are not reversed.

**Investments accounted for using the equity method. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are**
recognized initially at acquisition cost. After the date of acquisition, the Company’s share of the result from an associate,
which is recognized in their statements of profit or loss, is recognized in the Group statement of profit or loss and it increases
or decreases the carrying amount of the investment. The Company’s share of the result from an associate, which is
recognized in their statements of other comprehensive income, is recognized in the Group statement of other
comprehensive income and it increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment. If the Company’s share of losses
in an associate exceeds its interest in them, further losses are not recognized, unless the Company has incurred obligations
on behalf of the associate. The carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method is reduced by
profit distributions made by the associate.

**Non-current accounts receivable. Non-current non-interest-bearing accounts receivable are recognized at present value. For**
non-current accounts receivable, a valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in accordance with the
Simplified Approach of IFRS 9.

**Deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liabilities method. Deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities are**
recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding tax accounts, the result of which will be a future tax refund or tax expense. Deferred tax assets on losses
carried forward are recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be an available taxable profit against which the
temporary difference can be applied.

Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in
which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. If there is a change in the tax rates, the effect on the deferred
tax assets and/or liabilities is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted.

**Provisions. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits are determined in accordance with IAS 19 using the**
actuarial projected unit credit method. This method takes into account, in particular, the current long-term capital market
interest rate and current assumptions regarding future salary and annuity increases in addition to biometric calculation
bases. In accordance with IAS 19, the remeasurements of the provisions for pensions are recognized directly in other
comprehensive income. The interest element in the pension expense is reported under finance costs.

With the exception of the other personnel-related provisions calculated in accordance with IAS 19, all other provisions are
recognized on the basis of IAS 37, providing there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. The amount recognized is determined based on the full amount required to settle the probable obligation. Noncurrent provisions are discounted. The interest element is reported under finance costs.

**Liabilities. At the time of recognition, liabilities are measured at fair value. They are then subsequently measured at**
amortized cost using the effective interest method. Non-current non-interest-bearing liabilities are discounted. Liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate.


-----

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging. In accordance with IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments are recognized**
on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. On the trade date of a derivative, it is determined whether this
derivative is an instrument to maintain fair value, to hedge a planned transaction or to hedge against future cash flow
fluctuations relating to a recognized asset or a liability.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate instruments and the foreign exchange hedging instruments of the Company are
recognized as financial income and finance costs. In these financial statements, the term “hedging instrument” is used from a
purely economic perspective and not based on the definition of IFRS 9.

**Fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables and current liabilities is**
virtually the same as their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of the money market funds and the Notes is based on
quoted market prices on active markets at the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivatives is equivalent to their fair
value at the balance sheet date that is calculated based on observable market data according to IFRS 13. The fair values of
the non-current financial liabilities (except for the Notes) and the non-current liabilities to shareholders are determined in
accordance with IFRS 13 (see note 19).

**Share-based payment. The Techem 671 Group maintains various share-based compensation plans.**

Under the terms of a management participation program, which was set up by one of its main investors, employees of the
Techem 671 Group (including the most senior management) were given the opportunity to invest indirectly into the Group
with their own cash. This participation program is deemed to be a share-based payment arrangement. It is classified as
equity-settled and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

In addition, the employees of the Techem 671 Group received a commitment for a bonus that will be paid out in the event of
defined exit scenarios, including an IPO of the Techem 671 Group or parts thereof. The amount of the bonus is based on exit
proceeds. This commitment is also classified as equity-settled.

Any expense arising from an equity-settled share-based payment scheme is recognized as personnel expense in profit or loss
with a corresponding credit to equity. The distribution of the expense is based on the grant date fair value. This fair value will
not change later, i.e. it will not be updated for changes in expectations underlying its determination.

The recognition of expense over time is determined by the vesting conditions of the participation program, particularly
service and exit conditions. Exit conditions are classified as non-market vesting conditions.

**Borrowing costs. Borrowing costs that meet the requirements of IAS 23.4 are capitalized and thereafter amortized over the**
useful life of the asset. Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Research and development. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred as part of development projects (mainly**
being software development) are recognized as intangible assets, if it is considered probable that the project will be
commercially successful, is technically feasible and the costs can be reliably determined. Other development costs that do
not satisfy these criteria are expensed as incurred.

**Recognition of revenue from major business activities. The majority of the contracts with customers in the Group are fixed-**
price agreements, under which the Group acts as principal. Revenue is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed in the
contracts with customers. As the Group uses the practical expedient of IFRS 15, the transaction price is only adjusted for the
effects of a significant financing component if the expected period between when the Company transfers goods or services
to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services is more than one year. In the Group, this can be
applicable for installment sales.

Some contracts in the Group include multiple performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price is allocated to each
performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices. If they are not directly observable, they are
estimated based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.

For all major products listed below, payment terms may be in advance or in arrears.

**Reading and billing services**
Under reading and billing agreements, the Company provides reading and billing services based on actual consumption
figures. Revenue from reading and billing services is recognized over time as the performance does not create an
alternative use to the customer and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to
date. Revenue for reading and billing services is accrued, using an output-based method of measuring the progress


-----

towards complete satisfaction of this performance obligation, to an amount equivalent of the cost of services already
rendered plus a profit margin. The calculation is based on the percentage of completion of the billing process of the flats
as at the balance sheet date.

If the reading and billing services rendered by the Company are not completed to date and exceed the payment received
from the customer, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments received from the customer exceed the services
rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some reading and billing agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace a
current agreement with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the
statement of financial position and released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the contract
term as, with these payments, no distinct good or service is acquired from the customer.

**Rental and maintenance services**
Under rental agreements, the Company rents meters to customers for a specific period and ensures functionality and
operability of the meters during the contractual term. Under maintenance agreements, functionality and operability of
the meters are ensured for the customer’s meters during the contractual term. Revenue from rental and maintenance
services is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the
Company as the Company performs. The revenue is recognized using an output-based measure of progress towards
complete satisfaction of these performance obligations on a straight-line basis over the contractual term.

If rental or maintenance services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a receivable
is recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the customer
exceed the services rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some rental agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace a current rental
agreement with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the statement of
financial position and released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the contract term to the
extent that no distinct good or service is acquired from the customer. A distinct good or service only exists in the case of
the acquisition of functioning meters from a competitor upon payment to the customer and if these meters are used by
the Company to provide services to the customer. In that case, the payment to the customer is recognized in the position
metering and other devices up to the fair value of the acquired meters.

**Sales**
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has been transferred to the
customer, being upon delivery. For goods sold, the Company only provides assurance type warranties which do not
exceed the legal requirements.

If the goods have been delivered by the Company before the payment is received from the customer, a receivable is
recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments are received from the customer
before the goods have been delivered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions**
With the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions, the Company mainly delivers energy (e.g. heat or cooling) to customers.
The revenue from energy deliveries is recognized over time based on output, as the customer simultaneously receives
and consumes the benefits of the energy provided by the Company as the Company performs. The revenue is recognized
in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.

If Energy Efficiency Solutions services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a
receivable is recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the
customer exceed the services rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

Expected deductions from revenue (e.g. cash discounts, quantity or trade discounts, non-contractual deductions) are
recognized.

Revenue is reported net of value-added tax and also net of the abovementioned deductions.

**Estimations and assumptions. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires assumptions and**
estimates to be made, which can have an impact on the valuation and disclosure of assets and liabilities, income and
expenses, as well as contingent liabilities.


-----

The fair values of the assets, which were identified and valued or revalued as a result of purchase price allocations, are based
on various assumptions, such as the future cash flows of the assets as per the business plan, the assumed royalty rate and
the relevant discount rates, adjusted for the Company’s business risk.

The revenues from energy deliveries in the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions, as well as the corresponding costs, are
determined for the portion not yet invoiced based on a calculation model. It determines the sales not yet invoiced
(essentially sales volume and commodity price) on the basis of current price developments and weather conditions, as well
as the costs on the basis of the consumption quantities transmitted by the energy supplier.

Assumptions and estimations also relate to the accounting and measurement of provisions. For non-current provisions, the
discount rate is an important estimate. It is based on market yields of high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds observable on
the financial markets at the balance sheet date. For pension provisions, assumptions about life expectancy, future salary and
pension increases are made.

Valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable are recognized based on their ageing structure. Additionally, receivables
which have been passed to lawyers for recovery are written down. The valuation allowances are calculated using
percentages based on historical experience. Currently, future-oriented information plays a minor role.

Allowances for expected credit losses are recorded for billed trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease
receivables and unbilled receivables, based on percentages which reflect the historical write-offs. Allowances for expected
credit losses on favorable bank balances are based on percentages which have been determined based on the default risks of
the respective banks.

The recoverability of goodwill and the trademark Techem is assessed based on the future cash flows as per the business plan
of the groups of cash generating units using a discount rate adjusted for the business risk. For further information see note 7.

The useful lives and amortization periods of customer relationships are determined based on historical data. For detailed
information see note 7.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that the recoverability of future tax benefits is probable. The actual usability
of deferred tax assets depends on the future actual taxable profit situation. This situation may differ from the estimations at
the date of capitalization of the deferred tax assets.

When determining the fair value of financial instruments, assumptions are used that, among other things, are derived from
observable market data. For detailed information see note 19.

The valuation of interest and foreign exchange derivatives is dependent on future interest and exchange rate developments
and assumptions on which these are based.

For the measurement of share-based compensation in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value is determined taking into
account the corporate planning.
**Management participation program (MEP). Through their investment in the management participation program (MEP),**
employees of Techem 671 Group will share in the proceeds generated in a future exit event. This participation entitlement is
based on the value of the company or its equity. In addition, beyond a rather typical investment of shareholders, the MEP
provides for vesting conditions that link the claim to the provision of continued services to the Group up to the time of exit.
Therefore, the participation program is accounted for as a share-based payment under IFRS 2 in the consolidated financial
statements of the Company.

The future payouts in any of the various exit scenarios will be made to plan participants based on conditions that are equally
applicable to all shareholders for the instruments held. Instruments are settled according to a predefined order. Neither the
exit scenarios nor the leaver scenarios, result in any stand-alone obligation for the Techem 671 Group to settle the MEP,
which should be accounted for as a liability under IFRS 2. Therefore, the MEP is classified as equity-settled. Expenses related
to the MEP are only recognized to the extent that a benefit was granted to plan participants beyond their original
investment. The Company has determined the fair values of the MEP investments at the respective grant dates and
compared it to the cash invested by plan participants. Ultimately, the plan participants invested at fair value at inception
date. No benefit was granted to the plan participants.

**Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In 2022, employees were involved in an LTIP. First of all, this provides for a participation**
opportunity similar to the participation under the MEP.


-----

In addition, the LTIP contains the commitment of the holding company Luxembourg Investment Company 261 via an exit
bonus, which is paid out in the event of defined exit scenarios. However, entitlement only exists if the beneficiary employees
are still employed by the company at the time of the exit. The payout amount of the bonus is based on the exit proceeds of
the Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and is therefore stock-based. Since the obligation to pay the bonus lies with the
Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and thus outside the Techem 671 Group, this commitment is also considered as
equity-settled and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

For further details of the valuation, see note 18.

Further explanations concerning estimations and assumptions on which the preparation of this annual report is based are
made within the relevant notes.

All assumptions and estimations made are based on the circumstances as at the balance sheet date. The actual future
circumstances may differ. When this occurs the assumptions are adjusted, and if applicable, the book values of the respective
assets and liabilities are also adjusted.

The useful life of the customer relationships is between 25 to 50 years, based on historical customer loyalty.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (trademark Techem) as well as
software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an annual impairment test at the balance sheet date. If
there are new indicators during the course of a year that a group of CGUs (“cash generating unit”) may be impaired, an
additional impairment test is carried out for this group of CGUs.


-----

The impairment test is carried out as described below:

The goodwill as well as the other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assigned to the appropriate groups
of CGUs. Energy Services Germany, Energy Services International and Energy Efficiency Solutions each represent one
group of CGUs. The classification of groups of CGUs follows the internal control structure of management.

For each group of CGUs, the recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is measured as the higher of
a CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the carrying amount of a group of CGUs exceeds the
calculated recoverable amount an impairment loss must be recognized.

**Energy Services Germany. The recoverable amount of Energy Services Germany is determined on the basis of value in**
use. The future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy Services
Germany. The cash flows for subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.5 percent growth rate (financial
year 2021/2022: 1.5 percent) and a constant cost ratio. These future cash flows are then discounted to present value.
The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital – “WACC”) was determined using the capital asset pricing
model (“CAPM”) and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 6.37 percent for the group of CGUs Energy
Services Germany (financial year 2021/2022: 5.78 percent).

The five-year plan of Energy Services Germany is based on the following assumptions:

      - The growth in revenue results from a systematic further development of the existing products as well as
from an extension of the existing product portfolio and services. Thereby, positive effects are also expected
from future regulatory measures relating to climate change.

      - This growth rate includes a contract termination rate that corresponds to the market conditions. The
average increase in prices of services is in line with moderate market developments.

      - In addition to the increasing revenue, quality improvements and cost savings have a positive impact on EBIT
as a result of the continuous optimization of internal activities and further digitalization of operating
processes within the value-enhancing program ENERGIZE-T.

      - The planned investments are based on a regular replacement of metering devices and smoke detectors and
a moderate increase resulting from new business. Investments will mainly be made in metering devices as
well as smoke detectors and SMART readers, which are operated using radio technology. As a result, the
plan includes an increase in depreciation on metering and other devices.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Services International. The recoverable amount of Energy Services International is determined on the basis of**
value in use. The future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy Services
International. The cash flows for subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.5 percent growth rate
(financial year 2021/2022: 1.5 percent) and a constant cost ratio. These future cash flows are then discounted to
present value. The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital – “WACC”) was determined using the capital
asset pricing model and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 7.42 percent for the group of CGUs Energy
Services International (financial year 2021/2022: 6.73 percent).

The five-year plan of Energy Services International is based on the following assumptions:

      - In the mature international markets, a slight but constant growth in the existing business is expected. This
growth is driven by both volume and price increases.

      - For some countries, a stronger growth is expected in the next five years as a result of the introduction of
the European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), especially in Spain and Poland.

      - Additional growth is expected through strengthening of the sales team by regional expansion,the
introduction of new digital products and services as well as from future regulatory measures relating to
climate change.


-----

   - The main driver of the growth in EBIT is the market growth in the EU countries as a result of the
introduction of the EED. In addition, cost savings are expected in the next five years, for example through
reduced reading costs as a result of the increase in remote reading (Techem Smart System, hereinafter also
referred to as TSS), which will be reflected in the results in the coming years and will be tracked in the
Operational Excellence program.

   - The planned investments are based on the regular replacement of metering devices in the respective
countries, increased investments in rental equipment as a result of the EED waves mentioned above and
the TSS roll-out. This results in an increase in annual depreciation.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions. The recoverable amount of Energy Efficiency Solutions is determined on the basis of fair**
value less costs of disposal, which are assumed to be 1 percent of the fair value. To calculate the fair value, the future
cash flows are based on the ten-year plan of Energy Efficiency Solutions. Additionally, expansion investments are
included in the calculation. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.5 percent
(financial year 2021/2022: 1.5 percent) and a constant cost ratio. The total future cash flows are then discounted
using the WACC before tax of 5.05 percent (financial year 2021/2022 4.65 percent).

The business plan of Energy Efficiency Solutions until the financial year 2032/2033 is based on the following
assumptions:

   - In principle, future investments will only be made in green, decarbonized plants. This is based on the
assumption of an increasing CAPEX profile.

   - Due to the increased specific investment volumes compared to conventional, gray solutions, the base price
share of total sales rises sharply over the course of the planning period, and EBITDA and EBIT also show
significant growth, driven by the increased investments in energy generation plants.

   - EBIT growth is mainly based on growth from new business in the customer segments of the real estate
industry (existing buildings in the housing industry and commercially used properties), new construction
(property development business) and when existing facilities have to be replaced due to their age as part of
the decarbonization of supply solutions.

   - With regard to portfolio protection (churn avoidance), the plan assumes an increase in customer loyalty for
expiring contracts from the current 66% to 90% from financial year 2025/2026.

   - For the energy price development of the main energy source natural gas and the other energy sources
(heating oil, district heating, biomethane and wood pellets), the price level was assumed at the start of
planning and gradually normalized for the following years due to the current high price level. The energy
margin for existing and new business was set at the normal level of recent financial years at 5%, while the
margin for contracts already concluded was set at the calculated margin.

   - Investment planning is based on specific investment figures in the construction of energy generation plants,
driven by new business and the safeguarding of existing assets. With rising investments, a sharp increase in
depreciation on plants is expected in the coming years.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

Deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets include deferred tax liabilities on customer relationships, technologies and
software amounting to €525,395 thousand as at September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: €541,914 thousand), which result
from the step-ups and the recognition of assets due to the purchase price allocation in conjunction with the acquisition of
the Techem Metering Group on July 31, 2018. They are reduced as a result of the amortization of the assets over their useful
lives. They will not affect cash in future. For the trademark Techem, deferred tax liabilities of €64,525 thousand were
recognized as at September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022: €64,440 thousand).

As at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the other timing differences shown under deferred tax assets relate
mainly to the balance sheet items trade accounts receivables.

A tax group exists between Techem 672 mbH, Techem 673 mbH, Techem 674 mbH, Techem 675 mbH, Techem Metering
GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH, Techem Solutions GmbH, Techem X GmbH and bautec
Energiemanagement GmbH for the tax period 2022. The basis for the calculation of deferred taxes for the tax group is the tax
rate of 29.98 percent.

As of October 1, 2021, another income tax group exists between DMG Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH, BFW Ternes GmbH,
Exakta-Kalorex GmbH and MessTech GmbH. As of January 1, 2022, MATec Wolski Gesellschaft für Meß- und
Abrechnungstechnik mbH was included retroactively for the 2022 assessment period.
In October 2022, the group expanded to include the following companies: ALPHA MESS Bergisch-Land GmbH, MESSWERT
Unternehmen für Messdienstleistungen GmbH, ares e-count GmbH, DATA REAL Meßtechnik GmbH and SANNcompact
GmbH.


-----

In August 2023, TT Thermo Tronic GmbH, Ditschun Wärmemesstechnik GmbH and Wärmemessdienst Weise GmbH followed,
retroactively to October 1, 2022.
Dietsche GmbH Billing Service was included from July 1, 2023 and Kupferschmid Billing Service GmbH from January 1, 2023.
The underlying tax rate for the group is 29.55 percent.

As at September 30, 2023, the amount of €516 thousand (September 30, 2022: €1,017 thousand) of the deferred tax assets
resulting from provisions for pensions amounting to €2,664 thousand (September 30, 2022: €2,665 thousand), was
recognized in other comprehensive income with no effect on profit or loss.

The deferred taxes include €183 thousand (September 30, 2022: €0 thousand) non-current deferred tax assets and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities of €723,412 thousand (September 30, 2022: €728,450 thousand).

At the balance sheet date, there were tax losses carried forward of approximately €24,771 thousand (September 30, 2022:
€25,209 thousand), of which €24,091 thousand (September 30, 2022: €22,558 thousand) were not recognized as deferred tax
assets due to uncertain usability. The current estimate of the write-downs on the net tax losses carried forward may change
depending on the financial performance of the Company and tax legislation in future years, which may necessitate an
adjustment to the write-downs.

The unused tax losses of €24,091 thousand (September 30, 2022: €22,558 thousand) for which no deferred tax asset has
been recognized, mainly relate to the following entities:

As at September 30, 2023, deferred tax liabilities of €183,950 thousand (September 30, 2022: €186,420 thousand) were not
recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries as the Company is able to control the
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that these temporary differences will not reverse in the
foreseeable future.

On December 15, 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2022/2523 ensuring a global minimum level of
taxation for multinational groups of companies and large domestic groups in the EU.

The Bundestag implemented the Directive on November 10, 2023 with the Act on the Implementation of Council Directive
(EU) 2022/2523 on Ensuring Global Minimum Taxation and Other Accompanying Measures (so-called "Minimum Taxation
Directive Implementation Act"). The Federal Council is expected to approve it on December 15, 2023.

The Act contains provisions on Pillar 1 for the (partial) redistribution of taxing rights of multinational groups of companies, as
well as simplifications on transfer pricing and on Pillar 2 for a global minimum taxation. According to the Minimum Taxation
Directive Implementation Act, a tax of at least 15% is to be levied in each country on the basis of commercial accounting.
Techem, as a company with a turnover of more than 750 million euros per year and based in various countries, is covered by
this law.

However, the law contains exceptions (so-called "safe harbour rules"). Among other things, if the turnover of subsidiaries
abroad is less than 10 million euros and the tax expense is less than 1 million euros. After an initial preliminary review of the
law, we assume that the exemptions apply to our subsidiaries that have an effective tax rate, i.e. income tax in relation to
profit before tax, of less than or equal to 15%. Thus, there is currently no risk for Techem.

On July 30, 2018, Blitz F18-674 GmbH (later renamed Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH) issued Senior Notes (due
2026) in an aggregate principal amount of €465,000 thousand. The proceeds of the Senior Notes were used to fund the
consideration payable for the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group and to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition and the related financing.

Additionally, on July 31, 2018, the 2017 Senior Facilities Agreement of Techem Metering Group was amended, restated and
merged with the Initial Senior Facilities Agreement, which was executed on July 19, 2018 by Blitz F18-675 GmbH (later
renamed Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH). At the time, the resulting Senior Facilities Agreement comprised the
Facility B in a nominal amount of €2,340,000 thousand and the Revolving Credit Facility in a nominal amount of €275,000
thousand (both due 2025).

Facility B comprised two tranches, Facility B1 and B2. Amounts under Facility B2 were utilized by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH and applied in or towards:

  - financing or refinancing the consideration paid for the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group;

  - refinancing or discharging any of the existing debt of the Techem Metering Group and paying any related breakage
costs, redemption premium, make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such
refinancing or discharge; and

  - financing or refinancing the payments of costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Techem Metering
Group and all other fees, costs and expenses relating thereto.


-----

The amount of Facility B1 was equal to certain amounts which had been outstanding under the 2017 Senior Facilities
Agreement and had historically been utilized by Techem Energy Metering Service GmbH & Co. KG (meanwhile all assets and
liabilities of this company moved over by way of succession to Techem Metering GmbH) and Techem GmbH.

In January 2019, the Company repurchased its Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €51,100 thousand on a
voluntary basis.

On July 24, 2019, the Company agreed a repricing of its Facility B. As a result of this, the margin existing at that time was
reduced from 375 basis points to 350 basis points. For that purpose, Facilities B1 and B2 in an unchanged principal amount
were rolled over into the new Facility B3. This resulted in modification gains of €18,583 thousand due to the revaluation of
Facility B. On August 16, 2019, the Company made a partial repayment of its Facility B in an amount of €50,000 thousand on
a voluntary basis.

On January 29, 2020, the Company carried out a refinancing and a further repricing of Facility B, in connection with which
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH issued Senior Secured Notes in an aggregate amount of €1,145,000 thousand (due
in July 2025). The proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes were used in full to partially repay the existing Facility B. As a result
of the refinancing and repricing, Facility B3 in a principal amount of €1,145,000 thousand was rolled over into the new
Facility B4. This resulted in modification gains of €26,143 thousand due to the revaluation of Facility B. Offsetting this,
accrued transaction costs and revaluation adjustments amounting to a total of €23,274 thousand were recognized as
expense relating to the repayment of the Facility B in the amount of €1,145,000 thousand. Furthermore, the maturity dates
of Facility B and the Senior Secured Notes were synchronized to July 2025. In the following, the conditions are explained in
detail.

In September 2021, Senior Notes in a nominal amount of €50,000 thousand were repaid (redemption).

As at September 30, 2023, Facility B is fully drawn down with a nominal amount of €1,145,000 thousand. Of the Revolving
Credit Facility, €248,020 thousand are unutilized (utilized commitments being €20,000 thousand drawn as cash and
€6,980 thousand drawn by way of guarantees). In the financial year 2022/2023, there were cumulative drawings of €70,000
thousand and cumulative repayments of €99,931 thousand of the Revolving Credit Facility (both in cash). The outstanding
principle amount of the Senior Secured Notes is €1,145,000 thousand, the remaining outstanding principle amount of the
Senior Notes is €363,900 thousand as at September 30, 2023.

For both facilities, interest is based on EURIBOR for loans in Euro and LIBOR for non-Euro loans. Until July 2020, the relevant
margin according to the current Senior Facilities Agreement was 287.5 basis points for Facility B and 275 basis points for the
Revolving Credit Facility. Afterwards, the relevant margin may vary between 287.5 basis points and 237.5 basis points
regarding Facility B and between 275 basis points and 175 basis points regarding the Revolving Credit Facility, depending on
the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio in respect of the most recently completed twelve-month period preceding the interest
payment. In the event of a negative EURIBOR, the “zero-floor” applies and the margin is not reduced. Effective February 22,
2023, the margin of the Facility B reduced to 237.5 basis points and the margin of the Revolving Credit Facility reduced to 175
basis points due to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio test (before, these margins were 262.5 and 200 basis points).
Interest rate caps with total nominal amount of €880,000 thousand were concluded in December 2022 and January 2023 to
partially hedge the variable-interest Facility B (€1,145,000 thousand) against interest rate risks.

The Senior Secured Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 2.000%. The Senior Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 6.000%. As at
September 30, 2023, accrued interest on the Notes amounts to €8,410 thousand.

The loan agreement specifies certain limits for the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. If the ratio lies above these limits, a
certain percentage of an excess cash flow, which is also defined in the agreement and must also be adjusted by extraordinary
effects, has to be used for mandatory prepayments of the Facility B. This excess cash flow has to be calculated yearly for the
preceding twelve-month period. Interest payments on the Facility B are currently made on the basis of the six-monthEURIBOR. As at September 30, 2023, accrued interest on the loans of the Senior Facilities Agreement amounts to €17,998
thousand.

The liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging agreements are secured
on a first-priority basis. The obligations rank pari passu in right of payment with any obligation that is not subordinated.

The liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH, Techem Metering GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH and
Techem Solutions GmbH.

**14.** **Leases**

**The Company as lessee**

The Company leases various properties, IT equipment and cars. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain
a wide range of different terms and conditions. Typically, lease contracts are concluded for fixed periods with additional
termination or prolongation options for one or both parties. In some cases, indefinite contract periods with termination
options for one or both parties are agreed.

Under the financing arrangements, restrictions regarding lease agreements must be observed. As at September 30, 2023, the
Company complies with the restrictions.

Right-of-use assets resulting from leases where the Group is the lessee are as follows:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2023** **Sep 30, 2022**

Right-of-use assets relating to land and buildings ................................................................... 74,436 90,792
Right-of-use assets relating to office furniture and equipment ............................................... 30,023 15,604
**Right-of-use assets ...........................................................................................................** **104,459** **106,396**

Additions to the right-of-use assets during the financial year 2022/2023 amount to €46,891 thousand (financial year
2021/2022: €14,813 thousand). Further additions result from the change in scope amounting to €1,285 thousand, which
relate to the acquisition of subsidiaries during the financial year 2022/2023. For further details, see note 27.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss shows the following amounts relating to leases:

€ thousand **2022/2023** **2021/2022**

Depreciation charge for right-of-use assets relating to:
Land and buildings ............................................................................................................ 11,026 11,302
Office furniture and equipment ....................................................................................... 11,274 10,721
**Total depreciation charge for right-of-use assets ............................................................** **22,300** **22,023**

**Expenses relating to short-term leases (recognized in the position “Other expenses” in**
**the statement of profit or loss) ..................................................................................** **300** **238**

As in the previous year, no impairment losses for right of use assets have been recognized in the financial year 2022/2023.

The total cash outflow for leases (incl. interest payments) for the financial year 2022/2023 was €26,173 thousand (financial
year 2021/2022: €23,584 thousand).

For further information regarding future undiscounted cash flows (gross), see section F. OTHER DISCLOSURES –
“Concentration of risk”.

The valuation of extension and termination options qualified as not reasonably certain to be exercised are not included in the
lease liabilities and may lead to potential future cash outflows amounting to €40,047 thousand (undiscounted) compared to
the current assumptions in the calculation of the lease liabilities (financial year 2021/2022: €33,927 thousand).


-----

In the financial year 2022/2023, the changes in initial assumptions regarding the exercise of extension and termination
options resulted in a decrease in lease liabilities and right-of-use assets by €2,951 thousand (undiscounted) (financial year
2021/2022: €93 thousand).

As at the balance sheet date, the Company is committed to certain leases for vehicles, which have not yet commenced at this
date. In the financial year 2023/2024, the initial measurement of the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities from these
leases is expected to amount to €7,081 thousand.

**The Company as lessor**

The Company enters into finance leases as lessor. These leases are primarily leases of charging infrastructure for e-mobility,
heat generation plants and other technical equipment. To account for these leases, the Company recognizes a receivable
equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. Payments by the lessee are treated as repayment of principal
and financial income.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss shows the following amounts relating to finance leases:

€ thousand **2022/2023** **2021/2022**

The change in the scope of consolidation in the 2022/2023 financial year is due to company acquisitions (see Note 27).

Personnel provisions mainly include obligations for variable remuneration and holiday obligations. They also include
provisions for employee time credits from overtime worked.

The provision for warranty claims is mainly recognised for obligations arising from defective appliance deliveries, incorrect
invoicing and assembly damage.

Restructuring provisions include provisions for personnel measures in connection with the personnel-related and
organisational implementation of digitalisation and efficiency measures that have already been implemented.

Maintenance service provisions have been recognised to cover the replacement of equipment as part of maintenance
contracts. Only defective devices or devices with an expired calibration period that are covered by the maintenance contracts
and had not yet been replaced as at the balance sheet date are affected.

The amount reported under "Other" for the 2022/2023 financial year mainly relates to provisions for contributions to
associations, for expansion and maintenance obligations, for damage claims, for renovation obligations and for audits.

As the net currency differences are not material, they are not recognised separately. They are included in the "Reversals"
column.

future cash outflows).

The amount reported under "Other" for the 2022/2023 financial year mainly comprises provisions for general overhauls, for
damage claims and for renovation obligations.

As the net currency differences are not material, they are not recognised separately. They are included in the "Reversals"
column.

**17.** **Provisions for pensions**

The pension plans of the subsidiaries vary depending on the legal, tax and economic situation in each country.

Most of the pension schemes in place in Germany as well as in other countries are defined benefit plans, some of which are
funded and others unfunded.

There are pension schemes in place for former members of the senior management of Techem Energy Services GmbH and
Techem GmbH, with a separate scheme for each person. These pension schemes are based on the pensionable remuneration
of each employee and the employee's period of service. In addition, the Company has set up a relief fund.

There are also pension plans in place for all active and some former employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG. According to the
pension scheme in Switzerland those plans are funded, respectively reinsured. The pension plans comprise retirement
pensions as well as risk benefits (invalidity and death). The retirement pensions are determined based on the retirement
assets and a conversion rate. Risk benefits are defined as a fixed percentage of insured salary.

The provisions for pensions are computed on the basis of independent actuarial reports. The provisions for defined benefit
obligations are determined using the standard international method known as the Projected Unit Credit Method (in
Germany, in conjunction with the Prof. Dr. Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables).

The funded obligations are supported by suitable qualified insurance policies (pledged reinsurances) that meet the conditions
for plan assets. Accordingly, plan assets are offset against the provisions.

The amount of pension obligations is subject to risks arising in connection with the change in life expectancy, the future
amount of pension adjustments and the development of capital market interest rates To cover those risks insurance policies


-----

(reinsurances) have been taken out for some of the defined benefit pension obligations. The reinsurances are mostly not
traded on an active market.

1) Positions recognized in other comprehensive income
2) Positions recognized in profit or loss


-----

Since all the pension obligations relating to the employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG which retired during the year under
review are covered by the insurance company, both the present value of the funded obligation and the fair value of the plan
assets are each reduced by the same amount. In the financial year 2022/2023 this value amounts to €0 thousand (financial
year 2021/2022: €579 thousand each).

The current service costs and past service costs are included in the personnel expenses. The interest costs and the returns on
plan assets are included in the financial result. Remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The breakdown of the remeasurements is as follows:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2023** **Sep 30, 2022**

Actuarial gains/ losses from changes in financial assumptions .................................... 459 (8,020)
Actuarial gains/ losses from changes in demographic assumptions ............................ 18 13
Experience gains/ losses ............................................................................................... 1,375 255
Gains/ losses from changes related to plan assets ...................................................... 141 411
**Remeasurements, recognized in other comprehensive income ..............................** **1,993** **(7,341)**

The basic assumptions applied in the computation of the provisions for pensions are as follows (average values):

% **Sep 30, 2022** **Sep 30, 2022**

Discount rate ................................................................................................................ 2.85% 2.89%
Salary increases ............................................................................................................ 2.09% 2.09%
Annuity increases ......................................................................................................... 0.85% 0.78%

As at September 30, 2023, an average discount rate of 4.05 percent, salary increases of 3 percent and annuity increases of
2.25 percent were applied to German defined benefit obligations (September 30, 2022 average discount rate 3.65 percent,
salary increases 3 percent, annuity increases 2 percent). For defined benefit obligations of Techem (Schweiz) AG, an average
discount rate of 1.85 percent, salary increases of 1.5 percent and annuity increases of 0 percent were applied as at
September 30, 2023 (September 30, 2022 average discount rate 2.3 percent, salary increases 1,5 percent, annuity increases 0
percent).

The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

**Assumption** **Change in assumption** **Impact on defined benefit obligation**

Discount rate Increase by 0.25 percentage points Decrease by 2.6%
Decrease by 0.25 percentage points Increase by 2.9%

Salary increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 0.5%
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 0.6%

Annuity increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 6.1%
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 2.2%

Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 2.3%
Decrease by 1 year Decrease by 2.1%

Taking into account the current higher changes in interest rates, sensitivity analyses were also carried out for a change in
assumptions of 1.0 percentage points in the discount rate. This results in an increase of 11.8% if the assumptions are
increased accordingly and a decrease of 10.6% if the assumptions are reduced accordingly


-----

The method applied when determining the sensitivities is consistent to that applied when calculating the obligation at the
balance sheet date.

In the financial year 2022/2023, the expenses for contribution-based pension schemes amounted to €16,347 thousand
(financial year 2021/2022: €14,674 thousand), thereof for the German entities €14,248 thousand (financial year 2021/2022:
€12,731 thousand), mainly relating to the employer's contribution to the statutory pension scheme.

In the financial year 2023/2024, contributions to the plan assets are expected to amount to €1,300 thousand.

The weighted average duration of the pension plans is 12.2 years (financial year 2021/2022: 12.5 years).

The maturity analysis of the benefit payments is as follows:

**Maturity** **< 1 year** **1-2 years** **2-5 years** **> 5 years**

**18.** **Equity**

**Share capital. As at September 30, 2023, the share capital of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH remains unchanged**
at €100,000 (September 30, 2022: €100,000). The share capital of the Company is divided into 49,999 shares A, 50,000 shares
B and 1 share C, each having a nominal value of €1. The share capital has been paid in full.

**Capital reserves. As at September 30, 2023, the capital reserves include a paid-in capital of €563,127,044 (September 30,**
2022: €563,127,044).

**Retained earnings. Retained earnings contain the net result of the financial year, the net results generated in the past and**
the cumulative other comprehensive income, consisting of exchange differences, of remeasurements of provisions for
pensions as well as of income taxes on other comprehensive income.

**Capital management disclosures. Among its objectives, Techem 671 Group endeavors to secure its equity base over the**
long-term and generate an appropriate return on capital employed. However, in this regard, the equity as per the Group's
balance sheet is only an indirect management criterion, whereas revenue as well as EBIT/EBITDA are direct management
criteria, whereby the Company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

The following table shows the change in equity and financial liabilities:

**Share-based payments/ management participation program (MEP). In March 2019, the main investors implemented a**
management participation program (MEP). This program provides an opportunity to plan participants to invest indirectly in
the Group and to share in any increase in value through their own investment. For this purpose, plan participants acquire a
package that consists of a portion of the shareholder loan (see note 11) as well shares A and B issued by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH. A total of 3,575 shares A and 253 shares B were sold to plan participants as at September
30, 2021. Since that, no shares were sold to plan participants. Through their investment plan participants will share in the
capital proceeds generated in a future exit event (IPO or trade sale of the group). The claim represented by the investment is
subject to vesting conditions which require services to be provided to the group until an exit occurs (service condition). If
plan participants leave before such exit, they may forfeit all or part of their entitlement. The investment will then fall back to
the investor and may be issued to other or new plan participants. The management participation program is accounted for as
equity-settled share-based payment.

The fair value of the shares granted is measured at grant date. Shares A and B held under the terms of the MEP are treated as
options and are valued using an option pricing model. All other assumptions were derived consistently from the impairment
test. The total value of the MEP shares A and B held corresponded to the own investment made by plan participants.

For the existing plan participants of the MEP, no expenses have to be recorded either in the period, in which the share are
granted, or in any future periods.

In spring 2022, the so called LTIP was launched as a further share-based program. This initially provides for an opportunity to
participate on the same terms as in the MEP above. In this respect, the statements made in this regard apply.


-----

In addition, the members of the Techem 671 Group received commitments via an exit bonus, which will be paid out in the
event of defined exit scenarios. In addition to certain sale scenarios relating to the shares of Luxembourg Investment
Company 261 in the Techem 671 Group, in which the main investors give at least control, the IPO of Luxembourg Investment
Company 261 S.à r.l. or one of its subsidiaries is considered to be an exit. The bonus entitlement reflects participation in the
increase in value of the Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and the Techem 671 Group since the respective grant date,
based on an agreed basic amount. The bonus is additionally determined by a time factor. The later the exit takes place, the
lower the bonus becomes ceteris paribus. Luxembourg Investment Company 261 may pay the bonus in cash or shares in
Techem 671 Group.

The fair value of the bonus commitment at the grant date is based on an agreed base amount as a result of a simulation of
the increase in value up to the expected exit date. Based on a starting value, which was consistently derived to the
impairment test, the possible increase in value up to the assumed exit event was determined by means of a Monte Carlo
simulation and the basic amount multiplied by the increase in value in %.

The derived total value for the shares held under the LTIP (including exit bonus) essentially corresponded to the plan
participants' own investment. For the existing plan participants of the LTIP, no expenses have to be recorded either in the
period, in which the share are granted, or in any future periods.

**19.** **Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities**

Financial assets only contain debt instruments. According to the “SPPI test”, the financial assets except for money market
funds generate cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Furthermore, according to the “Business model
test” these financial instruments’ cash flows solely result from collecting contractual cash flows (IFRS 9.4.1.2). Therefore, the
financial assets except for the money market funds are recorded at amortized costs. As the “SPPI-test” for the money market
funds fails they are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The following table provides an overview of carrying amounts and fair values of the financial instruments in the Techem 671
Group in accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRS 7:

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value by fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7 and
IFRS 13. The different levels have been defined as follows:

  - level 1: financial instruments traded in active markets for which unchanged quoted prices are taken as
measurement

  - level 2: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters derived directly or indirectly from
observable market data

  - level 3: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters that are not based on observable
market data

For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, no transfers between Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy
occurred in the financial year 2022/2023.
It is assumed that the fair values of all current items are approximately equivalent to their carrying amounts. The main
reason for this is the short maturity of these instruments.


-----

For non-current other financial assets, non-current trade accounts payable and non-current other financial liabilities the
carrying amounts are approximately equivalent to their fair values.

The fair value of money market funds is based on quoted market prices on an active market at the balance sheet date.

As at September 30,2023, the fair values of hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting (interest rate caps) are
determined based on the difference between the variable interest rate agreed as part of the underlying transaction and the
interest rate limited by the cap.

The fair values of the Notes are their respective quoted market prices as at September 30, 2023.

The fair value of non-current financial liabilities (loans), measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted cash
flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used are term adequate riskadjusted discount rates. The risk adjustment is made based on the CDS spreads of Techem.

The fair value of non-current liabilities to shareholders, measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted cash
flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rate used is the internal rate of return
of Techem Senior Notes as at September 30, 2023.

The respective fair values of the Notes mentioned above fall into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The aforementioned fair
values of the non-current financial liabilities (excluding the Notes) and non-current liabilities to shareholders are attributed to
Level 2.

Net gains or losses on financial instruments of the Techem 671 Group consist of the following:

As the significant part of the earnings before tax is generated in Germany, the Group weighted average tax rate is 29.98
percent (see note 9).

Deferred taxes have been calculated using the relevant enacted tax rate.

As of September 30, 2023, income tax liabilities amounted to €14,593 thousand (September 30, 2021: €17,677 thousand), a
decrease of €3,084 thousand. This is mainly due to the German tax Techem 672 group, as further advance payments were
made for the year 2021/2022 and the corresponding income tax liabilities were thus reduced (€12,504 thousand). The
income tax liabilities for corporate income tax and trade tax for the 2022/2023 financial year had a countervailing effect of
€6,321 thousand (financial year 2021/2022: €12,720 thousand) in the Techem 672 Group. The other effects are mainly
distributed among the other Techem companies in Germany and abroad.


-----

A tax audit began at the end of 2022 for the following German companies Techem 671 mbH, Techem 672 mbH, Techem 673
mbH, Techem 674 mbH, Techem 675 mbH, Techem Metering GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH, Techem
Solutions GmbH, bautec Energiemanagement GmbH, Techem Verwaltungs GmbH, Techem Energie GmbH and Techem
Vermögensverwaltung GmbH & Co. KG. Essentially, the corporate income tax, trade tax and value added tax for the
assessment periods 2017 to 2019 are examined.

The following table shows the reconciliation from the weighted average tax rate for the Group to the effective tax rate:

**2022/2023** **2021/2022**

€ thousand % € thousand %

**Earnings before tax** **(25,433)** **11,239**

**Expected income tax** **7,625   29.9** **(3,365)   29.9**

Non-deductible interest expense ......................................................................... (36,679) (144.2) (29,249) 260.3
Permanent differences ......................................................................................... (5,052) (19.9) (4,544) 40.4
Differences from differing tax rates ..................................................................... 5,241 20.6 3,761 (33.5)
Change in tax rate for deferred taxes .................................................................. (783) (3.1) 1,085 (9.7)
Taxes unrelated to the reporting period .............................................................. 29 0.1 2,715 (24.2)
Reversed/ unrecognized deferred tax assets on tax losses carried forward ....... (1,172) (4.6) (528) 4.7
Other .................................................................................................................... 554 2.2 3,934 (35.0)

**Effective tax expense and tax rate .................................................................** **(30,237) (119.0)** **(26,191)** **232.9**

As a result of the German interest barrier rule, the interest expense is not tax-deductible in full. The non-deductible portion
of interest expense is therefore accumulated as interest carried forward. As at September 30, 2023, the interest carried
forward amounts to €538,352 thousand (September 30, 2022: €419,202 thousand). No deferred taxes were recognized on
the interest carried forward due to the uncertainty that it can be used during the planning period of five years.

The permanent differences mainly relate to trade tax add-backs relating to interest expense both in the financial year
2022/2023 and in the financial year 2021/2022.

Other differences in the financial year 2021/2022 mainly result from the derecognition of deferred taxes from the
elimination of temporary differences in previous years.

The changes in tax rate for deferred taxes in the financial year 2022/2023 mainly result from changes in the trade tax rate
from 14.11 percent to 14.15 percent.

**27.** **Acquisitions**

In the financial year 2022/2023, all the shares in the following companies were acquired:

  - Energie Beratung Unternehmen Dresden Messdienst GmbH, Dresden/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“EBU“),

  - MAW Service GmbH, Mess-, Abrechnungs- und Wartungsdienst, Kassel/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“MAW“),

  - Böhm Abrechnungs GmbH & Co.KG, Kitzingen/ Germany und Böhm Verwaltungs GmbH, Kitzingen/ Germany,
(hereinafter also referred to as “Böhm“),

  - asko GmbH, Erfurt/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “asko“),

  - Messteam 2000 GmbH, Neumarkt/Oberpfalz/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Messteam“),

  - INHA GmbH, Hirrlingen/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “INHA“),

  - EECS spol. s.r.o., Trutnov/ Czech Republic, (hereinafter also referred to as “EECS“),

  - enco Energy Services GmbH, Bochum/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “enco“)

The main intention regarding these acquisitions is to strengthen the core business at local level. The business of these
companies comprises primarily the reading, consumption-based billing of energy and water consumption as well as the
rental and the sale of the respective devices. A purchase price totaling €66,851 thousand was paid for the acquisition of
these companies.

The following table shows the total purchase price and the net cash outflow relating to the above acquisitions:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2023**

**Total purchase price ..............................................................................................................................** **66,851**

Add: contingent considerations paid (relating to the acquisition in the financial year 2022) ....................... 1,018

**Net cash outflow relating to the acquisitions[2)] .......................................................................................** **62,795**

1) The contingent considerations result from earn-out clauses whose occurrence depends on the level of the customer contract termination rate or on the level of revenues of the
company in the years after the acquisition. The amounts were determined based on the best estimate of the expected cash outflows.
2) Significant cash outflows related with the acquisitions result from the purchase of Messteam (€25,194 thousand) and enco (€19,365 thousand).

The breakdown of the net assets acquired is as follows:

€ thousand **Fair value**

Cash and cash equivalents .............................................................................................................................. 4,959
Metering and other devices ............................................................................................................................ 16,975
Customer relationships and trademarks ........................................................................................................ 42,518
Other assets (current and non-current) [1)] ...................................................................................................... 7,249
Liabilities (current and non-current)............................................................................................................... (11,337)

Gain from a bargain purchase[4)] ...................................................................................................................... (111)

**Total purchase price .............................................................................................................................** **66,851**

1) including trade receivables (gross) of €2,559 thousand and allowances for these trade receivables of €36 thousand. The book value of these receivables correspond to their fair
value.
2) The acquired net assets of Messteam and enco mainly result from metering and other devices in the amount of €6,343 thousand and €3,753 thousand respectively, customer
relationships and trademarks in the amount of €15,924 thousand and €10,992 thousand respectively, liabilities (current and non-current) in the amount of €4,373 thousand and
€1,314 thousand respectively, as well as deferred tax liabilities in the amount of €5,979 thousand and €2,073 thousand respectively. Furthermore, trade receivables were acquired
in the gross amount of €1,153 thousand and €618 thousand respectively. Allowances for these receivables were built in the amount of €5 thousand and €19 thousand. The book
value of these receivables correspond to its fair value.
3) thereof €7,997 thousand of Messteam and €5,911 thousand of enco.
4) The gain from a bargain purchase was reported in other income. The amount mainly comes from the fair value valuation of the customer relationships performed during the
purchase price allocations.

The goodwill of €20,123 thousand mainly comprises intangible assets, which cannot be identified separately and mainly
reflects expected future growth of earnings as a result of synergies and the increase in the market share in the respective
region. It is not tax-deductible.

If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of the Techem 671 Group since October 1, 2022, Group revenues
would have amounted to €1,020,572 thousand and Group net loss to €54,080 thousand. Since joining the Group, the
acquisitions generated total revenues of €9,019 thousand and total net income of €902 thousand in the reporting period
(thereof €3,974 thousand revenues and €354 thousand net income of Messteam as well as €418 thousand revenues and
€559 thousand net income of enco).

Costs directly attributable to the acquisitions amounted to €1,464 thousand, which were recognized in other expenses.

**28.** **Non-current assets and liabilities held for sale**

In the financial year 2023, the management decided to sell all shares in Techem Energy Services LLC, Dubai/United Arab
Emirate. As at September 30, 2023 the sale was considered highly probable, so that the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary
were classified as held for sale. The company is part of Energy Services segment and the disposal group mainly comprises
cash and cash equivalents in the amount of €1,431 thousand, trade receivables in the amount of €750 thousand, metering
and other devices in the amount of €416 thousand and other current liabilities in the amount of €1,219 thousand.

From the reclassification to held for sale, a loss of €243 thousand was recognized from the depreciation and impairment of
metering and other devices, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets.

The sale was completed on October 6, 2023.

**F.** **OTHER DISCLOSURES**

**Segment reporting**

The segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments is prepared due to the issuance of Notes in July 2018
by Techem 674 mbH and the issuance of Notes in January 2020 by Techem 675 mbH which are traded in a public market.
Both companies are indirect subsidiaries of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH.

Within the segment Energy Services, the Company provides its customers, which mainly comprise service providers in the
housing and real-estate industry, with measurement, sub-meter reading and billing services relating to energy and water
consumption. The reading and billing services are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which impact the results of operations
accordingly.

The Company rents and sells metering devices, which are necessary to provide the services. Rental contracts for the metering
devices have a term of up to ten years.

The Company also offers maintenance services required for the devices. Maintenance services are included in the rental
contracts. For sold devices the maintenance service is offered in separate maintenance contracts.

Techem’s supplementary services include the planning, installation and maintenance of smoke detectors. The smoke
detectors are usually rented to customers. In addition, the Company offers a smoke detector service.

In addition, Techem, in cooperation with SGS Institut Fresenius, offers legionella analysis services in Germany.

The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions represents a further development of our previous segment Energy Contracting. The
segment Energy Efficiency Solutions provides its customers with services in relation to the planning, financing, construction
and operation of heat generation plants. The plants are maintained continuously. Gas, oil, long-distance heating and
electricity are provided to the customers. In the short financial year 2020, the business unit water technology, which
comprises the professional operation of water treatment facilities, was transferred from the segment Energy Services to the
segment Energy Efficiency Solutions.

Consolidation entries are included under ”Other”.

The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied for the Group. The economic development of the Group and
its segments is managed by means of financial ratios. The financial ratios relevant to the management are revenue and
EBIT/EBITDA, whereby the company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

Investments in fixed assets are cash-effective additions to metering and other devices, to property, plant and equipment and
to intangible assets.

Intragroup transactions are carried out at market prices.

Techem has no customer with a share in revenue exceeding 10 percent.

To obtain external segment revenues by geographical area, the revenues are allocated to the region where they were
recognized. Non-current assets are reported based on their location. Non-current assets comprise metering and other
devices, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, non-current other assets and investments
accounted for using the equity method.

As a result of similar economic characteristics in the form of similar EBIT-margins for products and services, similar products
and services as well as similar distribution and customer structures, the operating segments Energy Services Germany and
Energy Services International are aggregated into a single reportable segment.

**Concentration of risk**

**Credit risks. The Company offers its services to a large number of customers active in various sectors and geographical**
regions. The Company grants credit terms to eligible customers and believes it is not exposed to an unreasonable
concentration of risks.

Imminent or actual irrecoverable receivables are accounted for by write-downs depending on the age of the receivable
concerned. Several dunning stages are also used. When a certain dunning stage is reached, legal action is initiated.
Furthermore, allowances for expected credit losses are recorded with respect to trade accounts receivable, contract assets,
finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables.

As at September 30, 2023, the total of trade accounts receivable, including receivables from finance lease (each current and
non-current), is €230,695 thousand (maximum default risk) (September 30, 2022: €221,719 thousand).

**Liquidity risk. The Company has secured its financing by long-term loan agreements (Term Loan B due in July 2025 and the**
Revolving Credit Facility due in June 2025) and the issuance of Notes (Senior Secured Notes due in July 2025 and Senior Notes
due in July 2026). The budget of the Company shows a positive development of the financial position, financial result and
cash flows. Therefore, the Company is not exposed to liquidity risk (see note 13).

The following table provides an overview of the maturity analysis for future cash flows of the financial liabilities. The future
cash flows are undiscounted cash flows including interest payments:

1) It is assumed that the accrued interest is paid at the end of each interest period.

**Interest rate risk and interest rate management. Interest rate risks arise from the fact that a large part of the financial**
liabilities is subject to a floating rate of interest (see note 13). There are no risks arising from the war in Ukraine.

Interest rate risk is analyzed centrally and managed by the Treasury department. Interest rate risk items are separated from
the liquidity commitment in individual hedge agreements with the help of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate caps,
and are managed as an overall portfolio to balance the risks. Interest rate derivatives are used exclusively to optimize credit
terms and limit interest rate risks as part of the Company's financing strategies and are not used for trading or speculation
purposes.

Hedging instruments are used in the Group to hedge interest rate risks on variable cash flows. As the caps limit the variable
cash flows on the loan, they are cash flow hedges, which are not subject to hedge accounting.


-----

The Company pursues a conservative strategy in hedging financial risks. In accordance with internal guidelines of the
Company, the use of derivatives is restricted to the hedging of existing risks. The Company only uses hedging instruments
that are measurable and have a transparent risk profile.

The Indentures of the Senior Notes include termination options, which are derivatives according to IFRS. These derivates
have to be separated from financial liabilities. The termination options can be exercised by the issuer of the Notes. Until July
30, 2023, these options were linked to a staggered premium on the nominal value. In the event of termination after this date,
the nominal value would have to be repaid. However, the value to be recorded as at September 30, 2023, is €0 because the
options are not in-the-money.

All derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. This is determined using the mark-to-market method
(for interest rate caps). The market values of interest rate caps are reported as other financial assets.

**Interest rate instruments not subject to hedge accounting. Changes in market value are recognized in the statement of**
profit or loss, but do not affect cash.

Techem has concluded interest rate hedges in the form of interest rate caps with a total nominal value of €880,000 thousand
to hedge interest rate risks. These interest rate instruments limit the 6-month EURIBOR to 3.5% for the period from July 4,
2023 to January 4, 2024. The total fair value as at September 30, 2023 amounts to €1,799 thousand. As at September 30,
2022, the company had payer swaps with a nominal value of EUR 1,600,000 thousand to hedge interest rate risks. These
payers swaps terminated in October 2022.

As at September 30, 2023, there are financial liabilities of €1,145,000 thousand from Facility B, €1,145,000 thousand from the
Senior Secured Notes and €363,900 thousand from the Senior Notes (both notes have a fixed interest coupon). Additionally,
the Revolving Credit Facility is drawn down with €20,000 thousand in cash at this time. As a result, 90.0% of the interest rate
risks of the non-current financial liabilities are hedged or capped at this time. If the 6-month EURIBOR had been one
percentage point higher in the financial year 2022/2023, the annual result would have deteriorated by €6,809 thousand if all
other variables had remained constant. If the 6-month EURIBOR had been one percentage point lower in the financial year
2022/2023, the result for the year would have improved by €7,714 thousand if all other variables had remained constant.

**Currency risk and currency management. A large part of the revenues was generated in the euro-area and was not subject**
to major currency risks. However, currency risks may originate from loans that Techem Energy Services GmbH grants to its
subsidiaries outside the euro-area as part of intercompany financings.

#### Auditor’s Report - Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn – Consolidated financial statements for the financial year from October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023

The following translation of the independent auditor’s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has
been issued in accordance with Section 322 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the consolidated financial
statements and group management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn, as of
and for the financial year ended September 30, 2023. The group management report is neither included nor incorporated by
reference in this Offering Memorandum. Please note, only the German language version of the auditor’s report including the
complete set of consolidated financial statements and group management report is authoritative.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn, and its
subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2023, and the
consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement
of cash flows for the financial year from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report
of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH for the financial year from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and
the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB

[Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2023, and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1 October 2022 to 30 September 2023, and

the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material
respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German
legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal
compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with
§ 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the
Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements
and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance
with the requirements of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material
respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e
Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of
the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are
responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e., fraudulent financial reporting and
misappropriation of assets) or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern.


-----

In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an
intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole,
provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial
statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have
considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable
German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group
management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides
an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial
statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents
the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on
the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB
and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions
of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group
management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not
detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of
arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion
on the effectiveness of these systems.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates
made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on
the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty
exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s
report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going
concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the
disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a
manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position
and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities
within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management
report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinions.


-----

Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity
with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant
assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper
derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on
the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that
future events will differ materially from the prospective information.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

for the financial year from

-----

**B. BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Techem 671 mbH and its subsidiaries. As
in previous years, the reporting date for the consolidated financial statements is 30. September.

The consolidated financial statements of Techem 671 Group for the year ended September 30, 2022 have been prepared
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) as adopted by the European Union (EU). In addition, the supplementary regulations in accordance with section
315(e) German Commercial Code have been applied. In accordance with IFRS, the consolidated financial statements have
generally been prepared using the historical cost measurement basis. In line with IFRS, a different basis has been used in
the measurement of purchase price allocations, money market funds, financial instruments, leases, provisions for
pensions and other post-employment benefits.

The measurement of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the relevant balance
sheet dates, as well as the amount of income and expenses for the period under review, are influenced by estimates and
assumptions made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Although these
estimates and assumptions have been made with the best knowledge of the management of the Company (specifically in
the case of accrued revenues, provisions and intangible assets), actual figures may ultimately vary from these estimates.

Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are shown in thousands of Euros (€ thousand). Rounding may lead to discrepancies
of ± one unit in the tables.

All standards of the IASB and all the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee
(IFRIC), which have to be applied in the EU, that were subject to mandatory application as at September 30, 2022, have
been applied by the Company in its consolidated financial statements.

An amendment of the authorized consolidated financial statements after issue is possible in case of major errors.

**C. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES**

**Principles of consolidation. Techem 671 mbH and all German and non-German subsidiaries which can be controlled**
directly or indirectly by Techem 671 mbH are included in the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are all
entities which are controlled by the Techem 671 Group. The Techem 671 Group controls an entity when it has power over
the entity, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to
use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the variable returns.

Investments in associates over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method.

All single-entity financial statements fully consolidated into the Techem 671 Group are prepared in accordance with
uniform accounting policies.

Subsidiaries acquired by the Company are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition costs are
equivalent to the fair value of the assets given up on the date of acquisition. For each business combination the assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities identified as part of the business combination are measured at their fair values on the
date of acquisition regardless of the extent of the non-controlling interest. The excess of acquisition costs over the
Group’s share in the fair value of the net assets is recognized as goodwill. If the Group’s share in the fair value of the net
assets exceeds the acquisition cost, the remaining excess from a bargain purchase is recognized in the statement of profit
or loss. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

When the Group sells shares in a subsidiary and ceases to have control, the difference between the book value of the
subsidiary (from a Group perspective) and the disposal proceeds (after deducting costs of disposal) are recognized in the
statement of profit or loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income relating to the
subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that
amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

Consolidation of an entity begins on the date on which control over the entity is obtained by the Company. It ceases when
the Group loses that control.

All intercompany gains and losses, revenue, income and expenses, loans, receivables and payables, provisions, contingent
liabilities and other financial obligations are eliminated. Deferred taxes are recognized using the liabilities method for all
temporary differences between the assets and liabilities tax bases and their carrying amounts.

**Currency translation. The functional currency of each subsidiary is its local currency. As a result, financial information**
from foreign subsidiaries is translated to Euros as follows: balance sheet figures are translated at the middle rates on the
balance sheet date, equity is translated at the historical rates, and profit or loss figures are translated at average rates for
the financial year. Currency translation gains or losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the transaction date.
Gains and losses resulting from such transactions and from the translation at the closing rate of monetary assets and
liabilities managed in foreign currency are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.


-----

**D. ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The balance sheet items are broken down into current and non-current items, non-current items being items for which
the maturity is expected to exceed twelve months.

**Cash and cash equivalents. The Company deems all highly liquid financial investments with an original maturity of up to**
three months to be cash equivalents. These cash equivalents are primarily favorable bank balances realizable at short
notice. Additionally, money market funds are included in cash equivalents. These are recognized at fair value through
profit or loss (market value), as the “contractual cash flow characteristics test” according to IFRS 9 fails. Gains and losses
are recognized in the statement of profit or loss as financial income or finance costs when they are incurred. For cash and
cash equivalents, a valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in accordance with the General Approach
of IFRS 9.

**Trade accounts receivable, contract assets, other assets and other financial assets. Current and non-current receivables**
(trade accounts receivable, other assets and other financial assets) and contract assets are measured at fair value on the
date of recognition and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method (including receivables from
installment-based business). The Group applies the Simplified Approach according to IFRS 9 for the calculation of
expected credit losses. Therefore, billed trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and unbilled
receivables are subject to allowances for expected credit losses over their entire term. To determine the expected credit
losses and incurred losses trade accounts receivable are arranged into groups based on their maturity and are
appropriately impaired based on their age.

Most of the Company’s installment-based business is in Eastern Europe. The receivables from installment-based business
are recognized at their present values.

The Group enters into finance leases as lessor. These leases are primarily leases of heat generation plants and other
machinery. To account for these leases, the Company recognizes a receivable equal to the present value of the minimum
lease payments. Payments by the lessee are treated as repayment of principal and financial income.

Costs to fulfill a contract result from costs accrued in order to align them with the corresponding recognition of revenue
for certain products. The costs to fulfill a contract are recognized as other assets. These are amortized over the contract
term and released in the statement of profit or loss into product expenses and purchased services.

**Inventories. Inventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined**
mainly on the basis of a weighted average. Potential losses resulting from obsolete or non-saleable inventories are
accounted for by means of appropriate write-downs.

**Metering and other devices and property, plant and equipment. Metering and other devices comprise devices, which**
are used in the rental business (including, for example, heat cost allocators, water meters, heat meters, smoke detectors
and other devices, which are installed on the customers’ premises and used as means for the provision of Techem billing
services), devices transferred for use and own tools. Metering and other devices are recognized at cost plus installation
costs reduced by depreciation in accordance with IAS 16.

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost reduced by depreciation. Gains or losses on the disposal of
property, plant and equipment are recognized as other income or other expenses.

Any subsidies received are deducted from the cost of the property, plant and equipment concerned and are recognized
over the useful life of the related asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.

(or shorter
lease term)

If a customer acquires, by corresponding payment, legal title of the metering and other devices when cancelling the rental
contract, resulting gains or losses on this disposal are accounted for as other income or other expenses.

Compensatory payments made by the customer when cancelling the rental contract are recognized as other income, if
the legal title of the metering and other devices is not transferred to the customer. Provided that the Company does not
have any alternative use for the metering devices, their residual values are impaired.

**Intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost.**

If the requirements under IAS 38 are satisfied, internally generated intangible assets are also recognized at cost. The costs
of internally generated intangible assets mainly include, depending on the project, capitalized own work of employees
and the costs of the support by external partners. These mainly result from the implementation, conception, test and
project organization phases of the projects.

Intangible assets are primarily amortized on a straight-line basis (pro rata temporis) over the following useful lives:

**Estimated**
**useful life**
**(years)**

Software, licenses and technology ................................................................................................................. 2 to 24
Customer relationships/customer agreements .............................................................................................. 25 to 50
Costs to obtain a contract ............................................................................................................................... approx. 4 to 15
Other trademarks ........................................................................................................................................... 3 to 15

The classification of the trademark Techem as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is based on the fact that
Techem has existed as a trademark since 1952. Brand awareness of Techem is very high in the market and Techem does
not plan to abandon this trademark. This classification is verified once a year.

Costs to obtain a contract result from variable remuneration of internal staff and from sales or agency commissions to
third parties in connection with the conclusion of customer contracts. The costs to obtain a contract are recognized as
intangible asset and presented in a separate asset category in the Group financial statements. The costs are amortized on
a straight-line-basis over the minimum contract term. For contracts that can be terminated by the customer without
penalty at any time, the contract term explicitly stated in the contract is considered the minimum contract term in that
context.

**Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases where the Group is the lessee are recognized as a right-of-use asset and**
corresponding liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is
allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period to
produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use
asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. Assets and


-----

liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease payments are discounted using the
interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

Payments relating to short-term leases of machinery, where the Group is the lessee, are recognized as an expense in the
statement of profit or loss.

**Recoverability of non-current assets. Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, including intangible**
assets, are tested for impairment as soon as events highlight, or there are indicators, that the carrying amount exceeds
the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its recoverable amount, the recoverable amount being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or the value
in use of the asset concerned. The value in use is defined as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be
derived from an asset or a cash generating unit (CGU). In accordance with IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the price
that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
For the purposes of determining an impairment, assets are grouped together into the smallest group for which separate
cash flows can be identified.

Goodwill, trademark Techem as well as software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an
impairment test at least once a year and are not subject to straight-line amortization. The impairment test is carried out
for groups of CGUs. Goodwill, the trademark Techem as well as software in development are measured at their original
cost less any accumulated impairment. Impairment losses recognized for goodwill are not reversed.

**Investments accounted for using the equity method. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are**
recognized initially at acquisition cost. After the date of acquisition, the Company’s share of the result from an associate,
which is recognized in their statements of profit or loss, is recognized in the Group statement of profit or loss and it
increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment. The Company’s share of the result from an associate,
which is recognized in their statements of other comprehensive income, is recognized in the Group statement of other
comprehensive income and it increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment. If the Company’s share of
losses in an associate exceeds its interest in them, further losses are not recognized, unless the Company has incurred
obligations on behalf of the associate. The carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method is
reduced by profit distributions made by the associate.

**Non-current accounts receivable. Non-current non-interest-bearing accounts receivable are recognized at present value.**
For non-current accounts receivable, a valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in accordance with the
Simplified Approach of IFRS 9.

**Deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liabilities method. Deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities**
are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the
corresponding tax accounts, the result of which will be a future tax refund or tax expense. Deferred tax assets on losses
carried forward are recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be an available taxable profit against which
the temporary difference can be applied.

Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in
which these temporary differences are expected to reverse. If there is a change in the tax rates, the effect on the deferred
tax assets and/or liabilities is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the new tax rate is
enacted.

**Provisions. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits are determined in accordance with IAS 19 using**
the actuarial projected unit credit method. This method takes into account, in particular, the current long-term capital
market interest rate and current assumptions regarding future salary and annuity increases in addition to biometric
calculation bases. In accordance with IAS 19, the remeasurements of the provisions for pensions are recognized directly in
other comprehensive income. The interest element in the pension expense is reported under finance costs.

With the exception of the other personnel-related provisions calculated in accordance with IAS 19, all other provisions are
recognized on the basis of IAS 37, providing there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event,
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of
the obligation. The amount recognized is determined based on the full amount required to settle the probable obligation.
Non-current provisions are discounted. The interest element is reported under finance costs.


-----

**Liabilities. At the time of recognition, liabilities are measured at fair value. They are then subsequently measured at**
amortized cost using the effective interest method. Non-current non-interest-bearing liabilities are discounted. Liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging. In accordance with IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments are**
recognized on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. On the trade date of a derivative, it is
determined whether this derivative is an instrument to maintain fair value, to hedge a planned transaction or to hedge
against future cash flow fluctuations relating to a recognized asset or a liability.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate instruments and the foreign exchange hedging instruments of the Company
are recognized as financial income and finance costs. In these financial statements, the term “hedging instrument” is used
from a purely economic perspective and not based on the definition of IFRS 9.

**Fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables and current liabilities**
is virtually the same as their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of the money market funds and the Notes is
based on quoted market prices on active markets at the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivatives is equivalent to
their fair value at the balance sheet date that is calculated based on observable market data according to IFRS 13. The fair
values of the non-current financial liabilities (except for the Notes) and the non-current liabilities to shareholders are
determined in accordance with IFRS 13 (see note 19).

**Share-based payment. The Techem 671 Group maintains various share-based compensation plans.**

Under the terms of a management participation program, which was set up by one of its main investors, employees of
the Techem 671 Group (including the most senior management) were given the opportunity to invest indirectly into the
Group with their own cash. This participation program is deemed to be a share-based payment arrangement. It is
classified as equity-settled and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

In addition, the employees of the Techem 671 Group received a commitment for a bonus that will be paid out in the
event of defined exit scenarios, including an IPO of the Techem 671 Group or parts thereof. The amount of the bonus is
based on exit proceeds. This commitment is also classified as equity-settled.

Any expense arising from an equity-settled share-based payment scheme is recognized as personnel expense in profit or
loss with a corresponding credit to equity. The distribution of the expense is based on the grant date fair value. This fair
value will not change later, i.e. it will not be updated for changes in expectations underlying its determination.

The recognition of expense over time is determined by the vesting conditions of the participation program, particularly
service and exit conditions. Exit conditions are classified as non-market vesting conditions.

**Borrowing costs. In accordance with IAS 23, borrowing costs are capitalized and thereafter amortized over the useful life**
of the asset. Borrowing costs, which are not subject to IAS 23, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Research and development. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred as part of development projects**
(mainly being software development) are recognized as intangible assets, if it is considered probable that the project will
be commercially successful, is technically feasible and the costs can be reliably determined. Other development costs that
do not satisfy these criteria are expensed as incurred.

**Recognition of revenue from major business activities. The majority of the contracts with customers in the Group are**
fixed-price agreements, under which the Group acts as principal. Revenue is measured at the fixed transaction price
agreed in the contracts with customers. As the Group uses the practical expedient of IFRS 15, the transaction price is only
adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component if the expected period between when the Company transfers
goods or services to the customer and when the customer pays for those goods or services is more than one year. In the
Group, this can be applicable for installment sales.

Some contracts in the Group include multiple performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price is allocated to
each performance obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices. If they are not directly observable, they are
estimated based on the expected cost plus a margin approach.

For all major products listed below, payment terms may be in advance or in arrears.


-----

**Reading and billing services**
Under reading and billing agreements, the Company provides reading and billing services based on actual
consumption figures. Revenue from reading and billing services is recognized over time as the performance does not
create an alternative use to the customer and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance
completed to date. Revenue for reading and billing services is accrued, using an output-based method of measuring
the progress towards complete satisfaction of this performance obligation, to an amount equivalent of the cost of
services already rendered plus a profit margin. The calculation is based on the percentage of completion of the billing
process of the flats as at the balance sheet date.

If the reading and billing services rendered by the Company are not completed to date and exceed the payment
received from the customer, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments received from the customer exceed the
services rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some reading and billing agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace
a current agreement with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the
statement of financial position and released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the
contract term as, with these payments, no distinct good or service is acquired from the customer.

**Rental and maintenance services**
Under rental agreements, the Company rents meters to customers for a specific period and ensures functionality and
operability of the meters during the contractual term. Under maintenance agreements, functionality and operability
of the meters are ensured for the customer’s meters during the contractual term. Revenue from rental and
maintenance services is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits
provided by the Company as the Company performs. The revenue is recognized using an output-based measure of
progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations on a straight-line basis over the contractual
term.

If rental or maintenance services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a
receivable is recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the
customer exceed the services rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some rental agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace a current
rental agreement with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the
statement of financial position and released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the
contract term to the extent that no distinct good or service is acquired from the customer. A distinct good or service
only exists in the case of the acquisition of functioning meters from a competitor upon payment to the customer and
if these meters are used by the Company to provide services to the customer. In that case, the payment to the
customer is recognized in the position metering and other devices up to the fair value of the acquired meters.

**Sales**
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has been transferred to the
customer, being upon delivery. For goods sold, the Company only provides assurance type warranties which do not
exceed the legal requirements.

If the goods have been delivered by the Company before the payment is received from the customer, a receivable is
recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments are received from the customer
before the goods have been delivered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions (formerly Energy Contracting)**
With the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions, the Company mainly delivers energy (e.g. heat or cooling) to customers.
The revenue from energy deliveries is recognized over time based on output, as the customer simultaneously receives
and consumes the benefits of the energy provided by the Company as the Company performs. The revenue is
recognized in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance
completed to date.


-----

If Energy Efficiency Solutions services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a
receivable is recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the
customer exceed the services rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

Expected deductions from revenue (e.g. cash discounts, quantity or trade discounts, non-contractual deductions) are
recognized.

Revenue is reported net of value-added tax and also net of the abovementioned deductions.

**Estimations and assumptions. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires assumptions**
and estimates to be made, which can have an impact on the valuation and disclosure of assets and liabilities, income and
expenses, as well as contingent liabilities.

The fair values of the assets, which were identified and valued or revalued as a result of purchase price allocations, are
based on various assumptions, such as the future cash flows of the assets as per the business plan, the assumed royalty
rate and the relevant discount rates, adjusted for the Company’s business risk.

The revenues from energy deliveries in the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions, as well as the corresponding costs, are
determined for the portion not yet invoiced based on a calculation model. It determines the sales not yet invoiced
(essentially sales volume and commodity price) on the basis of current price developments and weather conditions, as
well as the costs on the basis of the consumption quantities transmitted by the energy supplier.

Assumptions and estimations also relate to the accounting and measurement of provisions. For non-current provisions,
the discount rate is an important estimate. It is based on market yields of high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds
observable on the financial markets at the balance sheet date. For pension provisions, assumptions about life expectancy,
future salary and pension increases are made.

Valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable are recognized based on their ageing structure. Additionally,
receivables which have been passed to lawyers for recovery are written down. The valuation allowances are calculated
using percentages based on historical experience. Currently, future-oriented information plays a minor role.

Allowances for expected credit losses are recorded for billed trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease
receivables and unbilled receivables, based on percentages which reflect the historical write-offs. Allowances for
expected credit losses on favorable bank balances are based on percentages which have been determined based on the
default risks of the respective banks.

The recoverability of goodwill and the trademark Techem is assessed based on the future cash flows as per the business
plan of the groups of cash generating units using a discount rate adjusted for the business risk. For further information
see note 7.

The useful lives and amortization periods of customer relationships are determined based on historical data. For detailed
information see note 7.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that the recoverability of future tax benefits is probable. The actual
usability of deferred tax assets depends on the future actual taxable profit situation. This situation may differ from the
estimations at the date of capitalization of the deferred tax assets.

When determining the fair value of financial instruments, assumptions are used that, among other things, are derived
from observable market data. For detailed information see note 19.

The valuation of interest and foreign exchange derivatives is dependent on future interest and exchange rate
developments and assumptions on which these are based.

For the measurement of share-based compensation in accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value is determined taking into
account the corporate planning.


-----

**Management participation program (MEP). Through their investment in the management participation program (MEP),**
employees of Techem 671 Group will share in the proceeds generated in a future exit event. This participation
entitlement is based on the value of the company or its equity. In addition, beyond a rather typical investment of
shareholders, the MEP provides for vesting conditions that link the claim to the provision of continued services to the
Group up to the time of exit. Therefore, the participation program is accounted for as a share-based payment under IFRS
2 in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The future payouts in any of the various exit scenarios will be made to plan participants based on conditions that are
equally applicable to all shareholders for the instruments held. Instruments are settled according to a predefined order.
Neither the exit scenarios nor the leaver scenarios, result in any stand-alone obligation for the Techem 671 Group to
settle the MEP, which should be accounted for as a liability under IFRS 2. Therefore, the MEP is classified as equitysettled. Expenses related to the MEP are only recognized to the extent that a benefit was granted to plan participants
beyond their original investment. The Company has determined the fair values of the MEP investments at the respective
grant dates and compared it to the cash invested by plan participants. Ultimately, the plan participants invested at fair
value at inception date. No benefit was granted to the plan participants.

**Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP). In 2022, employees were involved in an LTIP. First of all, this provides for a participation**
opportunity similar to the participation under the MEP.
In addition, the LTIP contains the commitment of the holding company Luxembourg Investment Company 261 via an exit
bonus, which is paid out in the event of defined exit scenarios. However, entitlement only exists if the beneficiary
employees are still employed by the company at the time of the exit. The payout amount of the bonus is based on the
exit proceeds of the Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and is therefore stock-based. Since the obligation to pay the
bonus lies with the Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and thus outside the Techem 671 Group, this commitment is
also considered as equity-settled and accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

For further details of the valuation, see note 18.

Further explanations concerning estimations and assumptions on which the preparation of this annual report is based are
made within the relevant notes.

All assumptions and estimations made are based on the circumstances as at the balance sheet date. The actual future
circumstances may differ. When this occurs the assumptions are adjusted, and if applicable, the book values of the
respective assets and liabilities are also adjusted.

**Change in estimate of revenue and cost accrual – segment Energy Efficiency Solutions**
The business model of the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions includes the purchase of energy (e.g. electricity, gas, etc.)
from suppliers, which is mostly supplied to the customers in the form of heat through heat generation facilities. Monthly
instalments are paid to suppliers and received from customers on a linear basis. However, in the income statement, the
relevant revenues and the related costs are mainly accrued and recorded pursuant to a method of estimation. The
calculation model determines the sales not yet invoiced (essentially sales volume and commodity price) on the basis of
current price developments and weather conditions, as well as the costs on the basis of the consumption quantities
transmitted by the energy supplier. The improvement of the processes showed that, on the basis of the information
available as a result, more detailed estimates relating to the actual energy consumptions and deliveries are achievable. As
a result, a refined calculation model was applied to the accrual of revenues and costs for the financial year ending
September 30, 2022. The effect from the change in the model cannot be quantified, as this change was necessary in order
to determine appropriate estimates - under the framework conditions existing in the financial year. The effects of the
change in these accounting estimates on subsequent periods cannot be disclosed ex-ante, as these depend on future
energy consumption and deliveries as well as other parameters that cannot be forecast.

**Change in the estimation of the useful lives of water meters, heat meters, cold meters** **and heat cost allocators**

Resulting from the harmonization of the legal calibration periods of metering devices in Germany, the useful lives of
water meters, heat meters and cold meters were changed to six years starting from October 1, 2021. Previously, these
devices had either slightly lower or slightly higher useful lives, depending on the type. In addition, due to the verification
of battery runtimes, the useful lives of heat cost allocator were increased depending on the type to 13.5 or 18 years. The
following table shows the impact of this change as of September 30, 2022 and in future periods:

**Change in the estimation of the useful life of customer relationships**

The customer relationships identified as a result of the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group as of July 31, 2018 as
part of the purchase price allocation were previously amortized over a term of 13 (Energy Efficiency Solutions), 22 (Energy
Services Germany) and 24 years (Energy Services International). The customer loyalty programs launched in recent years
are showing their effect in the year under review and show a sustained decline in churn rate (decline in equipment
inventory in the reporting period on the basis of existing business). Accordingly, the useful life of customer relationships
was increased to 40 years in the Energy Services Germany and Energy Services International segments and to 25 years in
the Energy Efficiency Solutions segment. The following table shows the impact of this change as of September 30, 2022

The useful life of the customer relationships is between 25 to 50 years, based on historical customer loyalty. Regarding
the change in the useful life of the customer relationships identified during the purchase price allocation for the
acquisition of the Techem Metering Group on July 31, 2018 see note D.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (trademark Techem) as well
as software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an annual impairment test at the balance sheet
date. If there are new indicators during the course of a year that a group of CGUs (“cash generating unit”) may be
impaired, an additional impairment test is carried out for this group of CGUs.

The impairment test is carried out as described below:


-----

The goodwill as well as the other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assigned to the appropriate
groups of CGUs. Energy Services Germany, Energy Services International and Energy Efficiency Solutions each
represent one group of CGUs. The classification of groups of CGUs follows the internal control structure of
management.

For each group of CGUs, the recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is measured as the
higher of a CGU’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the carrying amount of a group of CGUs
exceeds the calculated recoverable amount an impairment loss must be recognized.

**Energy Services Germany. The recoverable amount of Energy Services Germany is determined on the basis of**
value in use. The future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy
Services Germany. The cash flows for subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.5 percent growth
rate (financial year 2020/2021: 1.0 percent) and a constant cost ratio. These future cash flows are then discounted
to present value. The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital – “WACC”) was determined using the
capital asset pricing model (“CAPM”) and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 5.78 percent for the
group of CGUs Energy Services Germany (financial year 2020/2021: 6.05 percent).

The five-year plan of Energy Services Germany is based on the following assumptions:

   - The growth in revenue results from a systematic further development of the existing products as well as
from an extension of the existing product portfolio and services. Thereby, positive effects are also
expected from future regulatory measures relating to climate change.

   - This growth rate includes a contract termination rate that corresponds to the market conditions. The
average increase in prices of services is in line with moderate market developments.

   - In addition to the increasing revenue, quality improvements and cost savings have a positive impact on
EBIT as a result of the continuous optimization of internal activities and further digitalization of
operating processes within the value-enhancing program ENERGIZE-T.

   - The planned investments are based on a regular replacement of metering devices and smoke detectors
and a moderate increase resulting from new business. Investments will mainly be made in metering
devices as well as smoke detectors and SMART readers, which are operated using radio technology. As a
result, the plan includes an increase in depreciation on metering and other devices.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Services International. The recoverable amount of Energy Services International is determined on the basis**
of value in use. The future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy
Services International. The cash flows for subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.5 percent growth
rate (financial year 2020/2021: 1.0 percent) and a constant cost ratio. These future cash flows are then discounted
to present value. The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital – “WACC”) was determined using the
capital asset pricing model and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 6.73 percent for the group of CGUs
Energy Services International (financial year 2020/2021: 6.57 percent).

The five-year plan of Energy Services International is based on the following assumptions:

  - In the mature international markets, a slight but constant growth is expected. This growth is driven by
price increases while some countries are faced with price pressure.

  - For some countries, a stronger growth is expected in the next five years as a result of the introduction of
the European Energy Efficiency Directive (EED), especially in Spain and Poland beginning with the financial
year 2022/2023 and beginning with the financial year 2023/2024 additionally in France.


-----

  - Additional growth is expected through strengthening of the sales team by regional expansion as well as
the introduction of new products and services in some countries (e.g. EV car charging) and also from
future regulatory measures relating to climate change.

  - The main driver of the growth in EBIT is the market growth in the EU countries as a result of the
introduction of the EED. In addition, cost savings are expected in the next five years, for example through
reduced reading costs as a result of the increase in remote reading (Techem Smart System, hereinafter
also referred to as TSS), which will be reflected in the results in the coming years and will be tracked in the
Operational Excellence program.

  - The planned investments are based on the regular replacement of metering devices in the respective
countries and increased investments in rental equipment as a result of the EED waves mentioned above
and the TSS roll-out. This results in an increase in annual depreciation.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions. The recoverable amount of Energy Efficiency Solutions is determined on the basis of**
fair value less costs of disposal, which are assumed to be 1 percent of the fair value. Due to investments in areas of
growth the calculation of value in use is based on the future cash flows from the ten-year plan of Energy Efficiency
Solutions. Cash flows beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.5 percent (financial
year 2020/2021: 1.0 percent) and a constant cost ratio. The total future cash flows are then discounted using the
WACC after tax 4.65 percent (financial year 2020/2021: 4.52 percent).

The business plan of Energy Efficiency Solutions until the financial year 2031/2032 is based on the following
assumptions:

  - The growth in EBIT is mainly based on the growth of new business in the real estate sector (existing
buildings of housing and commercial property) and the new buildings sector (especially real estate
development business). For the customer segment “existing buildings”, an increase is planned which
assumes a further increase in the importance of energy efficiency and CO2 avoidance for customers.

  - One of the main sales drivers is next to the extension of the contracting business also the entry to the EV
Charging and SmartMetering business, as well as metering point operation in Germany.

  - With regard to safeguarding of the existing business (avoiding churn), a conservative planning assumption
is made of a fuse rate of 60% for expiring contracts.

  - For the energy price development of the main energy source (i.e. natural gas) as well as other energy
sources (i.e. heating oil, long-distance heating, biomethane and wooden pellets) the level of prices at the
beginning of the planning was assumed and continued. The energy margin was left constant in the
existing business, but was fixed at the calculated margin for contracts under construction that had already
been concluded. No margin was recognized for new business.

  - The planned investments are based on specific investment ratios used in the construction of heat
generation plants, which are driven by the new business acquired and the safeguarding of the existing
business. With increasing investments, a strong increase in depreciation on machinery is expected in the
coming years.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the
Company, were examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would
exceed its recoverable amount.

Deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets include deferred tax liabilities on customer relationships, technologies and
software amounting to €541,914 thousand as at September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: €559,517 thousand), which
result from the step-ups and the recognition of assets due to the purchase price allocation in conjunction with the
acquisition of the Techem Metering Group on July 31, 2018. They are reduced as a result of the amortization of the assets
over their useful lives. They will not affect cash in future. For the trademark Techem, deferred tax liabilities of
€64,440 thousand were recognized as at September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: €64,342 thousand).

As at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the other timing differences shown under deferred tax assets relate
mainly to the balance sheet items trade accounts receivables.

A tax group exists between Techem 672 mbH, Techem 673 mbH, Techem 674 mbH, Techem 675 mbH, Techem Metering
GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH, Techem Solutions GmbH, Techem X GmbH and bautec
Energiemanagement GmbH for the tax period 2022. The basis for the calculation of deferred taxes for the tax group is the
tax rate of 29.94 percent.

With retroactive effect from October 1, 2021, there is a further tax group between DMG Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH,
BFW Ternes GmbH, Exakta-Kalorex GmbH and MessTech GmbH. From January 1, 2022, MATec Wolski Gesellschaft für
Meß- und Abrechnungstechnik mbH was retroactively included for the 2022 assessment period. The underlying tax rate
for this tax group is 29.55 percent.


-----

As at September 30, 2022, the amount of €1,017 thousand (September 30, 2021: €737 thousand) of the deferred tax
assets resulting from provisions for pensions amounting to €2,665 thousand (September 30, 2021: €4,842 thousand), was
directly recognized in equity.

The deferred taxes include no non-current deferred tax assets and non-current deferred tax liabilities of
€728,450 thousand.

At the balance sheet date, there were tax losses carried forward of approximately €25,209 thousand (September 30,
2021: €22,378 thousand), of which €22,558 thousand (September 30, 2021: €21,091 thousand) were not recognized as
deferred tax assets due to uncertain usability. The current estimate of the write-downs on the net tax losses carried
forward may change depending on the financial performance of the Company and tax legislation in future years, which
may necessitate an adjustment to the write-downs.

The unused tax losses of €22,558 thousand (September 30, 2021: €21,091 thousand) for which no deferred tax asset has
been recognized, mainly relate to the following entities:

**Expiring within** **Sep 30, 2022** **Sep 30, 2021**

**Total ...................................................................................** **22,558** **21,091**

As at September 30, 2022, deferred tax liabilities of €186,420 thousand (September 30, 2021: €187,307 thousand) were
not recognized for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries as the Company is able to control
the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that these temporary differences will not
reverse in the foreseeable future.

On July 30, 2018, Blitz F18-674 GmbH (later renamed Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH) issued Senior Notes (due
2026) in an aggregate principal amount of €465,000 thousand. The proceeds of the Senior Notes were used to fund the
consideration payable for the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group and to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition and the related financing.

Additionally, on July 31, 2018, the 2017 Senior Facilities Agreement of Techem Metering Group was amended, restated
and merged with the Initial Senior Facilities Agreement, which was executed on July 19, 2018 by Blitz F18-675 GmbH
(later renamed Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH). At the time, the resulting Senior Facilities Agreement
comprised the Facility B in a nominal amount of €2,340,000 thousand and the Revolving Credit Facility in a nominal
amount of €275,000 thousand (both due 2025).

Facility B comprised two tranches, Facility B1 and B2. Amounts under Facility B2 were utilized by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH and applied in or towards:

  - financing or refinancing the consideration paid for the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group;

  - refinancing or discharging any of the existing debt of the Techem Metering Group and paying any related
breakage costs, redemption premium, make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in
connection with such refinancing or discharge; and

  - financing or refinancing the payments of costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Techem
Metering Group and all other fees, costs and expenses relating thereto.


-----

The amount of Facility B1 was equal to certain amounts which had been outstanding under the 2017 Senior Facilities
Agreement and had historically been utilized by Techem Energy Metering Service GmbH & Co. KG (meanwhile all assets
and liabilities of this company moved over by way of succession to Techem Metering GmbH) and Techem GmbH.

In January 2019, the Company repurchased its Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €51,100 thousand on a
voluntary basis.

On July 24, 2019, the Company agreed a repricing of its Facility B. As a result of this, the margin existing at that time was
reduced from 375 basis points to 350 basis points. For that purpose, Facilities B1 and B2 in an unchanged principal
amount were rolled over into the new Facility B3. This resulted in modification gains of €18,583 thousand due to the
revaluation of Facility B. On August 16, 2019, the Company made a partial repayment of its Facility B in an amount of
€50,000 thousand on a voluntary basis.

On January 29, 2020, the Company carried out a refinancing and a further repricing of Facility B, in connection with which
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH issued Senior Secured Notes in an aggregate amount of €1,145,000 thousand
(due in July 2025). The proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes were used in full to partially repay the existing Facility B. As
a result of the refinancing and repricing, Facility B3 in a principal amount of €1,145,000 thousand was rolled over into the
new Facility B4. This resulted in modification gains of €26,143 thousand due to the revaluation of Facility B. Offsetting
this, accrued transaction costs and revaluation adjustments amounting to a total of €23,274 thousand were recognized as
expense relating to the repayment of the Facility B in the amount of €1,145,000 thousand. Furthermore, the maturity
dates of Facility B and the Senior Secured Notes were synchronized to July 2025. In the following, the conditions are
explained in detail.

In September 2021, Senior Notes in a nominal amount of €50,000 thousand were repaid (redemption).

As at September 30, 2022, Facility B is fully drawn down with a nominal amount of €1,145,000 thousand. Of the Revolving
Credit Facility, €220,115 thousand are not unutilized (utilized commitments being €49,931 thousand drawn as cash and
€4,954 thousand drawn by way of guarantees). In the financial year 2021/2022, there were cumulative drawings of
€109,931 thousand and cumulative repayments of €100,000 thousand of the Revolving Credit Facility (both in cash). The
outstanding principle amount of the Senior Secured Notes is €1,145,000 thousand, the remaining outstanding principle
amount of the Senior Notes is €363,900 thousand as at September 30, 2022.

For both facilities, interest is based on EURIBOR for loans in Euro and LIBOR for non-Euro loans. Until July 2020, the
relevant margin according to the current Senior Facilities Agreement was 287.5 basis points for Facility B and 275 basis
points for the Revolving Credit Facility. Afterwards, the relevant margin may vary between 287.5 basis points and 237.5
basis points regarding Facility B and between 275 basis points and 175 basis points regarding the Revolving Credit Facility,
depending on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio in respect of the most recently completed twelve-month period
preceding the interest payment. In the event of a negative EURIBOR, the “zero-floor” applies and the margin is not
reduced. Effective August 24, 2022, the margin of the Facility B reduced to 237.5 basis points and the margin of the
Revolving Credit Facility reduced to 175 basis points due to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio test (before, these
margins were 262.5 and 200 basis points). The Company has entered into payer swap agreements to hedge the interest
rate risks. The payer swaps in the amount of €1,600,000 thousand were fixed in 2018 with a term until October 2022. In
December 2022, an interest rate cap in the amount of €440,000 thousand was concluded to partially hedge the variableinterest Facility B (€1,145,000 thousand).

The Senior Secured Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 2.000%. The Senior Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 6.000%. As at
September 30, 2022, accrued interest on the Notes amounts to €8,410 thousand.

The loan agreement specifies certain limits for the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. If the ratio lies above these limits, a
certain percentage of an excess cash flow, which is also defined in the agreement and must also be adjusted by
extraordinary effects, has to be used for mandatory prepayments of the Facility B. This excess cash flow has to be
calculated yearly for the preceding twelve-month period. Interest payments on the Facility B are currently made on the
basis of the six-month-EURIBOR. As at September 30, 2022, accrued interest on the loans of the Senior Facilities
Agreement amounts to €8,089 thousand.

The liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging agreements are
secured on a first-priority basis. The obligations rank pari passu in right of payment with any obligation that is not
subordinated.

For further information regarding future undiscounted cash flows (gross), see section F. OTHER DISCLOSURES –
“Concentration of risk”.

As at September 30, 2022, the valuation of extension and termination options qualified as not reasonably certain to be
exercised are not included in the lease liabilities and may lead to potential future cash outflows amounting to €33,927
thousand (undiscounted) compared to the current assumptions in the calculation of the lease liabilities (financial year
2020/2021: €38,824 thousand).

In the financial year 2021/2022, the changes in initial assumptions regarding the exercise of extension and termination
options resulted in a decrease in lease liabilities and right-of-use assets by €93 thousand (undiscounted) (financial year
2020/2021: €6,225 thousand).

As at the balance sheet date, the Company is committed to certain leases for vehicles, which have not yet commenced at

The change in scope of the financial year 2021/2022 results from the acquisition of subsidiaries. For further details, see
note 27.

The personnel provisions mainly relate to provisions for variable remuneration and outstanding vacation entitlements.
Additionally, provisions for time credits of employees are included, which result from overtime worked.

The provision for warranties mainly relates to obligations due to defective devices, incorrect billing and faulty installation
services.

The restructuring provision mainly relates to a program to optimize the functional areas in Germany. The restructuring
provision is calculated according to the social plan, which was agreed with the worker's council, based on a certain
number of full-time employees multiplied by the average personnel costs or the individual personnel costs (as applicable).
For various initiatives, especially the actual numbers of employees concerned, the individual salaries or the number of
people resigning by themselves can deviate from the assumptions above.

Maintenance service provisions have been recognized in order to allow for the exchange of equipment under
maintenance agreements. The provisions only relate to cases where devices covered by maintenance agreements are
defective or have exceeded their legal calibration term but have not yet been exchanged by the Company as at the
balance sheet date.

In the financial year 2021/2022, the amount reported under “Other” mainly relates to provisions for contributions to
associations, for expansion and maintenance obligations, for damage claims, for renovation obligations and for tax audits.

Net exchange differences are not disclosed separately because they are not material. They are included in the “Reversals”
column.

Generally, a discount rate of 4.81 percent was applied to the provisions (the risk premium was taken into account in the
measurement of future cash outflows).

In the financial year 2021/2022, the amount reported under „Other” mainly relates to provisions for general overhauls,
for claims and for future tax audits.

Net exchange differences are not disclosed separately because they are not material. They are included in the „Reversals”
column.

**17. Provisions for pensions**

The pension plans of the subsidiaries vary depending on the legal, tax and economic situation in each country.

Most of the pension schemes in place in Germany as well as in other countries are defined benefit plans, some of which
are funded and others unfunded.

There are pension schemes in place for former members of the senior management of Techem Energy Services GmbH
and Techem GmbH, with a separate scheme for each person. These pension schemes are based on the pensionable
remuneration of each employee and the employee's period of service. In addition, the Company has set up a relief fund.

There are also pension plans in place for all active and some former employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG. According to the
pension scheme in Switzerland those plans are funded, respectively reinsured. The pension plans comprise retirement
pensions as well as risk benefits (invalidity and death). The retirement pensions are determined based on the retirement
assets and a conversion rate. Risk benefits are defined as a fixed percentage of insured salary.

The provisions for pensions are computed on the basis of independent actuarial reports. The provisions for defined
benefit obligations are determined using the standard international method known as the Projected Unit Credit Method
(in Germany, in conjunction with the Prof. Dr. Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables).

The funded obligations are supported by suitable qualified insurance policies (pledged reinsurances) that meet the
conditions for plan assets. Accordingly, plan assets are offset against the provisions.


-----

The amount of pension obligations is subject to risks arising in connection with the change in life expectancy, the future
amount of pension adjustments and the development of capital market interest rates. To cover those risks, insurance
policies (reinsurances) have been taken out for some of the defined benefit pension obligations. The reinsurances are
mostly not traded on an active market.

The following table shows the pension obligations for each reporting period:

1) Positions recognized in other comprehensive income
2) Positions recognized in profit or loss

Since all the pension obligations relating to the employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG which retired during the year under
review are covered by the insurance company, both the present value of the funded obligation and the fair value of the


-----

plan assets were each reduced by €579 thousand in the financial year 2021/2022 (financial year 2020/2021:
€745 thousand each).

The current service costs and past service costs are included in the personnel expenses. The interest costs and the returns
on plan assets are included in the financial result. Remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The breakdown of the remeasurements is as follows:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2022** **Sep 30, 2021**

Actuarial gains/ losses from changes in financial assumptions ................................ (8,020) (495)
Actuarial gains/ losses from changes in demographic assumptions ........................ 13 (884)
Experience gains/ losses ........................................................................................... 255 377
Gains/ losses from changes related to plan assets ................................................... 411 (104)
**Remeasurements, recognized in other comprehensive income ...........................** **(7,341)** **(1,106)**

The basic assumptions applied in the computation of the provisions for pensions are as follows (average values):

% **Sep 30, 2022** **Sep 30, 2021**

Discount rate ............................................................................................................ 2.89% 0.48%
Salary increases ........................................................................................................ 2.09% 1.85%
Annuity increases ...................................................................................................... 0.78% 0.87%

As at September 30, 2022, an average discount rate of 3.65 percent, salary increases of 3 percent and annuity increases of
2 percent were applied to German defined benefit obligations. For defined benefit obligations of Techem (Schweiz) AG,
an average discount rate of 2.3 percent, salary increases of 1.5 percent and annuity increases of 0 percent were applied
as at September 30, 2022.

The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

**Assumption** **Change in assumption** **Impact on defined benefit obligation**

Discount rate Increase by 0.25 percentage points Decrease by 2.6%
Decrease by 0.25 percentage points Increase by 2.9%

Salary increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 0.6%
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 0.6%

Annuity increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 6.1%
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 2.3%

Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 2.3%
Decrease by 1 year Decrease by 2.2%

The method applied when determining the sensitivities is consistent to that applied when calculating the obligation at the
balance sheet date.

In the financial year 2021/2022, the expenses for contribution-based pension schemes amounted to €14,674 thousand
(financial year 2020/2021: €13,895 thousand), thereof for the German entities €12,731 thousand (financial year
2020/2021: €12,226 thousand), mainly relating to the employer's contribution to the statutory pension scheme.

In the financial year 2022/2023, contributions to the plan assets are expected to amount to €1,221 thousand.


-----

The weighted average duration of the pension plans is 12.5 years (financial year 2020/2021: 14.6 years).

The maturity analysis of the benefit payments is as follows:

**18. Equity**

**Share capital. As at September 30, 2022, the share capital of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH remains**
unchanged at €100,000 (September 30, 2021: €100,000). The share capital of the Company is divided into 49,999 shares
A, 50,000 shares B and 1 share C, each having a nominal value of €1. The share capital has been paid in full.

**Capital reserves. As at September 30, 2022, the capital reserves include a paid-in capital of €563,127,044 (September 30,**
2021: €563,127,044).

**Retained earnings. Retained earnings contain the net result of the financial year, the net results generated in the past**
and the cumulative other comprehensive income, consisting of exchange differences, of remeasurements of provisions
for pensions as well as of income taxes on other comprehensive income.

**Capital management disclosures. Among its objectives, Techem 671 Group endeavors to secure its equity base over the**
long-term and generate an appropriate return on capital employed. However, in this regard, the equity as per the Group's
balance sheet is only an indirect management criterion, whereas revenue as well as EBIT/EBITDA are direct management
criteria, whereby the Company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

The following table shows the change in equity and financial liabilities:

**Share-based payments/ management participation program (MEP). In March 2019, the main investors implemented a**
management participation program (MEP). This program provides an opportunity to plan participants to invest indirectly
in the Group and to share in any increase in value through their own investment. For this purpose, plan participants
acquire a package that consists of a portion of the shareholder loan (see note 11) as well shares A and B issued by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH. A total of 3,575 shares A and 253 shares B were sold to plan participants as at
September 30, 2021. In the financial year 2021/2022 no shares were sold to plan participants. Through their investment
plan participants will share in the capital proceeds generated in a future exit event (IPO or trade sale of the group). The
claim represented by the investment is subject to vesting conditions which require services to be provided to the group
until an exit occurs (service condition). If plan participants leave before such exit, they may forfeit all or part of their
entitlement. The investment will then fall back to the investor and may be issued to other or new plan participants. The
management participation program is accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment.


-----

The fair value of the shares granted is measured at grant date. Shares A and B held under the terms of the MEP are
treated as options and are valued using an option pricing model. All other assumptions were derived consistently from
the impairment test. The total value of the MEP shares A and B held corresponded to the own investment made by plan
participants.

For the existing plan participants of the MEP, no expenses have to be recorded either in the period, in which the share are
granted, or in any future periods.

In spring 2022, the so called LTIP was launched as a further share-based program. This initially provides for an opportunity
to participate on the same terms as in the MEP above. In this respect, the statements made in this regard apply.

In addition, the members of the Techem 671 Group received commitments via an exit bonus, which will be paid out in the
event of defined exit scenarios. In addition to certain sale scenarios relating to the shares of Luxembourg Investment
Company 261 in the Techem 671 Group, in which the main investors give at least control, the IPO of Luxembourg
Investment Company 261 S.à r.l. or one of its subsidiaries is considered to be an exit. The bonus entitlement reflects
participation in the increase in value of the Luxembourg Investment Company 261 and the Techem 671 Group since the
respective grant date, based on an agreed basic amount. The bonus is additionally determined by a time factor. The later
the exit takes place, the lower the bonus becomes ceteris paribus. Luxembourg Investment Company 261 may pay the
bonus in cash or shares in Techem 671 Group.

The fair value of the bonus commitment at the grant date is based on an agreed base amount as a result of a simulation
of the increase in value up to the expected exit date. Based on a starting value, which was consistently derived to the
impairment test, the possible increase in value up to the assumed exit event was determined by means of a Monte Carlo
simulation and the basic amount multiplied by the increase in value in %.

The derived total value for the shares held under the LTIP (including exit bonus) essentially corresponded to the plan
participants' own investment. For the existing plan participants of the LTIP, no expenses have to be recorded either in the
period, in which the share are granted, or in any future periods.

**19. Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities**

Financial assets only contain debt instruments. According to the “SPPI test”, the financial assets except for money market
funds generate cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Furthermore, according to the “Business
model test” these financial instruments’ cash flows solely result from collecting contractual cash flows (IFRS 9.4.1.2).
Therefore, the financial assets except for the money market funds are recorded at amortized costs. As the “SPPI-test” for
the money market funds fails they are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

The following table provides an overview of carrying amounts and fair values of the financial instruments in the Techem
671 Group in accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRS 7:

**Financial liabilities .......................................................** **0** **11,238** **0** **11,238**

For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, no transfers between Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy
occurred in the financial year 2021/2022.

It is assumed that the fair values of all current items are approximately equivalent to their carrying amounts. The main
reason for this is the short maturity of these instruments.

For non-current other financial assets, non-current trade accounts payable and non-current other financial liabilities the
carrying amounts are approximately equivalent to their fair values.


-----

The fair value of money market funds is based on quoted market prices on an active market at the balance sheet date.

The fair values of hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting (interest rate swaps) are determined using the
mark-to-market valuation method. They are then adjusted by the own credit risk of the Techem 671 Group (or the
counterparty credit risk). The expected exposure to the credit risk is calculated on the basis of mark-to-market valuations
made by the counterparty. To determine the credit risk or rather the probability of default and the loss given default,
Techem CDS spreads are used. The credit risk is discounted using term adequate risk-free interest rates.

The fair values of the Notes are their respective quoted market prices as at September 30, 2022.

The fair value of non-current financial liabilities (loans), measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted
cash flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used are term
adequate risk-adjusted discount rates. The risk adjustment is made based on the CDS spreads of Techem.

The fair value of non-current liabilities to shareholders, measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted
cash flow method, calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rate used is the internal rate
of return of Techem Senior Notes as at September 30, 2022.

The respective fair values of the Notes mentioned above fall into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The aforementioned
fair values of the non-current financial liabilities (excluding the Notes) and non-current liabilities to shareholders are
attributed to Level 2.

-----

€97 thousand (financial year 2020/2021: €73 thousand). The increase in research and development costs included in
personnel costs and other expenses is due to the opportunities offered by digitization. In cooperation with industrial
partners, Techem develops device technologies as well as the necessary end and system devices for consumption reading,
smoke detection (smoke detectors) and for automated and complete digitized stationary remote reading (digital
infrastructure) as well as for remote monitoring of heating systems. In addition, Techem supports several Germany-wide
research projects.

As the significant part of the earnings before tax is generated in Germany, the Group weighted average tax rate is 29.94
percent (see note 9).

Deferred taxes have been calculated using the relevant enacted tax rate.

Income tax liabilities amounted to €17,677 thousand as at September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: €9,391 thousand).
Income tax liabilities increased by €8,286 thousand, as a result of the year-on-year increase in taxable income of the
German Techem 672 tax group with unchanged income tax advance payments of the German Techem 672 tax group in


-----

the amount of €24,135 thousand for the financial years 2021 to 2022. On the other hand, a provision for the financial
year 2021/2022 of €12,720 thousand was recorded for the German Techem 672 tax group.

For the following German companies Techem 671 mbH, Techem 672 mbH, Techem 673 mbH, Techem 674 mbH, Techem
675 mbH, Techem Metering GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH, Techem Solutions GmbH, bautec
Energiemanagement GmbH, Techem Verwaltungs GmbH and Techem Vermögensverwaltung GmbH & Co. KG, a tax audit
will begin at the end of 2022. The main audit areas are corporation tax, trade tax and value added tax for the assessment
periods 2017 to 2019.

The following table shows the reconciliation from the weighted average tax rate for the Group to the effective tax rate:

**2021/2022** **2020/2021**

**Effective tax expense and tax rate .............................................................** **(26,191)** **232,9** **(10,528) (14.4)**

As a result of the German interest barrier rule, the interest expense is not tax-deductible in full. The non-deductible
portion of interest expense is therefore accumulated as interest carried forward. As at September 30, 2022, the interest
carried forward amounts to €419,202 thousand (September 30, 2021: €321,580 thousand). No deferred taxes were
recognized on the interest carried forward due to the uncertainty that it can be used during the planning period of five
years.

The permanent differences mainly relate to trade tax add-backs relating to interest expense both in the financial year
2021/2022 and in the financial year 2020/2021.

Other differences in the financial year 2021/2022 mainly result from the derecognition of deferred taxes from the
elimination of temporary differences in previous years.

The changes in tax rate for deferred taxes in the financial year 2021/2022 mainly result from changes in the trade tax rate
from 14.15 percent to 14.11 percent.

**27. Acquisitions**

In the financial year 2021/2022, all the shares in the following companies were acquired:

  - ALPHA MESS Bergisch-Land Verwaltungs GmbH, Wuppertal/Germany and ALPHA MESS Bergisch-Land GmbH &
Co. KG, Wuppertal/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “ALPHA MESS“),

  - MESSWERT Unternehmen für Messdienstleistungen AG, Cologne/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“MESSWERT“),

  - E-BS Energy Billing Service S.r.l, Castenaso (BO)/Italy, (hereinafter also referred to as “E-BS“),

  - ares e-count GmbH, Berlin/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “ares“),

  - SANNcompact GmbH, Waldsee/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “SANNcompact“),

  - DATA REAL Meßtechnik GmbH, Berlin/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “DATA REAL“),

  - TT Thermo Tronic GmbH, Berlin/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “TT“),

  - Ditschun Wärmemesstechnik GmbH, Bielefeld/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Ditschun“),

  - Wärmemessdienst Weise GmbH, Eisenach/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Weise“),

  - ABZ Abrechnungs- und Beratungs-Service Einbeck GmbH, Einbeck/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“ABZ“),

  - Dietsche GmbH Abrechnungsservice, Bad Krozingen/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Dietsche“),

  - Kupferschmid Abrechnungsservice GmbH, Villingen-Schwenningen/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“Kupferschmid“).

Furthermore, the businesses of Delta-t Messdienst Uwe Schwalm, Groß-Umstadt/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to
as“Schwalm“), TN Heiz- und Betriebskosten GmbH, Berlin/ Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as“TN“), Delta-t
Messdienst Ralf Paulmann, Ilsede/ Germany, (last tranche; hereinafter also referred to as “Paulmann“), and CALORSYS
Magyarország Kft., Budapest//Hungary, (last tranche; hereinafter also referred to as“CALORSYS“) were acquired by way of
asset deals. The main intention regarding these acquisitions is to strengthen the core business at local level. The business
of ALPHA MESS, MESSWERT, E-BS, ares, SANNcompact, DATA REAL, TT, Ditschun, Weise, ABZ, Dietsche, Kupfer-schmid,
Schwalm, TN, Paulmann and CALORSYS comprises primarily the reading, consumption-based billing of energy and water
consumption as well as the rental and the sale of the respective devices. A purchase price totaling €68,120 thousand was
paid for the acquisition of these companies.

The accounting for these acquisitions is provisional because the determination of the contractually agreed purchase
prices has partly not yet been completed (as a closing balance sheet needs to be drawn up in accordance with the
purchase agreement) and in case of the asset deals mainly because the transfer of part of the customer contracts is
expected to take place after the balance sheet date. For the reasons mentioned, in particular the recorded amount of
goodwill and the fixed and intangible assets may still change.

The following table shows the total purchase price and the net cash outflow relating to the above acquisitions:

**Net cash outflow relating to the acquisitions[2)] ..................................................................................** **59,781**

1) The contingent considerations result from earn-out clauses whose occurrence depends on the level of the customer contract termination rate or on the level of revenues of
the company in the years after the acquisition. The amounts were determined based on the best estimate of the expected cash outflows.
2) Significant cash outflows related with the acquisitions result from the purchase of SANNcompact (€11,794 thousand) and Ditschun (€8,333 thousand).

**F. OTHER DISCLOSURES**

**Segment reporting**

The segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments is prepared due to the issuance of Notes in July
2018 by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH and the issuance of Notes in January 2020 by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH which are traded in a public market. Both companies are indirect subsidiaries of
Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH.

Within the segment Energy Services, the Company provides its customers, which mainly comprise service providers in the
housing and real-estate industry, with measurement, sub-meter reading and billing services relating to energy and water
consumption. The reading and billing services are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which impact the results of operations
accordingly.

The Company rents and sells metering devices, which are necessary to provide the services. Rental contracts for the
metering devices have a term of up to ten years.

The Company also offers maintenance services required for the devices. Maintenance services are included in the rental
contracts. For sold devices the maintenance service is offered in separate maintenance contracts.

Techem’s supplementary services include the planning, installation and maintenance of smoke detectors. The smoke
detectors are usually rented to customers. In addition, the Company offers a smoke detector service.

In addition, Techem, in cooperation with SGS Institut Fresenius, offers legionella analysis services in Germany.

The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions represents a further development of our previous segment Energy Contracting.
The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions provides its customers with services in relation to the planning, financing,
construction and operation of heat generation plants. The plants are maintained continuously. Gas, oil, long-distance
heating and electricity are provided to the customers. In the short financial year 2020, the business unit water
technology, which comprises the professional operation of water treatment facilities, was transferred from the segment
Energy Services to the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions.

Consolidation entries are included under "Other".

The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied for the Group. The economic development of the Group
and its segments is managed by means of financial ratios. The financial ratios relevant to the management are revenue
and EBIT/EBITDA, whereby the company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

Investments in fixed assets are cash-effective additions to metering and other devices, to property, plant and equipment
and to intangible assets.

Intragroup transactions are carried out at market prices.

Techem has no customer with a share in revenue exceeding 10 percent.

To obtain external segment revenues by geographical area, the revenues are allocated to the region where they were
recognized. Non-current assets are reported based on their location. Non-current assets comprise metering and other
devices, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, non-current other assets and investments
accounted for using the equity method.

As a result of similar economic characteristics in the form of similar EBIT-margins for products and services, similar
products and services as well as similar distribution and customer structures, the operating segments Energy Services
Germany and Energy Services International are aggregated into a single reportable segment.

As at September 30, 2022, there are further commitments resulting from financial guarantees issued by the Techem 671
Group in the amount of €184 thousand (September 30, 2021: €804 thousand).

**Concentration of risk**

**Credit risks. The Company offers its services to a large number of customers active in various sectors and geographical**
regions. The Company grants credit terms to eligible customers and believes it is not exposed to an unreasonable
concentration of risks.

Imminent or actual irrecoverable receivables are accounted for by write-downs depending on the age of the receivable
concerned. Several dunning stages are also used. When a certain dunning stage is reached, legal action is initiated.
Furthermore, allowances for expected credit losses are recorded with respect to trade accounts receivable, contract
assets, finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables.

As at September 30, 2022, the total of trade accounts receivable, including receivables from finance lease (each current
and non-current), is €221,719 thousand (maximum default risk) (September 30, 2021: €190,126 thousand).

The maximum default risk arising from money market funds is their fair value and amounts to €1,486 thousand as at
September 30, 2022 (September 30, 2021: €0 thousand).

**Liquidity risk. The Company has secured its financing by long-term loan agreements (Term Loan B due in July 2025 and**
the Revolving Credit Facility due in January 2025) and the issuance of Notes (Senior Secured Notes due in July 2025 and
Senior Notes due in July 2026). The budget of the Company shows a positive development of the financial position,
financial result and cash flows. Therefore, the Company is not exposed to liquidity risk (see note 13).

1) It is assumed that the accrued interest is paid at the end of each interest period.

**Interest rate risk and interest rate management. Interest rate risks arise from the fact that a large part of the financial**
liabilities is subject to a floating rate of interest (see note 13). There are no risks arising from the coronavirus pandemic
and the war in Ukraine.

Interest rate risk is analyzed centrally and managed by the Treasury department. Interest rate risk items are separated
from the liquidity commitment in individual hedge agreements with the help of interest rate derivatives, such as interest
rate swaps, and are managed as an overall portfolio to balance the risks. Interest rate derivatives are used exclusively to
optimize credit terms and limit interest rate risks as part of the Company's financing strategies and are not used for
trading or speculation purposes.

Hedging instruments are used in the Group to hedge interest rate risks on variable cash flows. As the swaps fix the
variable cash flows on the loan, they are cash flow hedges, which are not subject to hedge accounting.

The Company pursues a conservative strategy in hedging financial risks. In accordance with internal guidelines of the
Company, the use of derivatives is restricted to the hedging of existing risks. The Company only uses hedging instruments
that are measurable and have a transparent risk profile.

The Indentures of the Senior Notes include termination options, which are derivatives according to IFRS. These derivates
have to be separated from financial liabilities. The termination options can be exercised by the issuer of the Notes in steps
until July 30, 2023, each time taking into consideration a staggered premium on the principal amount. However, the value
to be recorded as at September 30, 2022, is €0 because the options are not in-the-money.

All derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. This is determined using the mark-to-market
method (for interest rate swaps), including a credit risk adjustment relating to the counterparty or the Company itself
(see note 19). The market values of interest rate swaps are reported as other financial liabilities.

**Interest rate instruments not subject to hedge accounting. Changes in market value are recognized in the statement of**
profit or loss, but do not affect cash.


-----

As at September 30, 2022, the Company had payer swaps with a total nominal value of €1,600,000 thousand related to
the Facility B and the Revolving Credit Facility of the Senior Facilities Agreement, which swap the three-month EURIBOR
against a four-year fixed interest rate of 0.167%. These payer swaps were fixed in 2018 with a term until October 2022. In
December 2022, an interest rate cap in the amount of €440,000 thousand was concluded to partially hedge the variableinterest Facility B (€1,145,000 thousand).

The aforementioned payer swaps have the following market values and maturities:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2022** **Sep 30, 2021**
**Nominal** **Market value** **Nominal Market value**
**amount** **amount**

**Total .........................................................................................** **1,600,000** **(64)** **1,600,000** **(11,238)**

1) In this table interest rate swaps are presented according to their contractual term. Liabilities from hedging instruments are shown under current other financial liabilities
because the instruments can be cancelled at any time.

As at September 30, 2022, Facility B has been drawn down with a nominal amount of €1,145,000 thousand. In addition,
the Revolving Credit Facility has been drawn down with a nominal amount of €49,931 thousand as cash. Consequently,
these loans with variable interest charges are fully secured by the interest rate swaps (the interest charge is currently
based on the 6-month EURIBOR plus a margin). The over-hedging amounts to €405,069 thousand. If the 3-month
EURIBOR had been higher by one percentage point in the financial year 2021/2022, the Group net loss would not have
changed due to the unchanged fair value of the interest rate instruments as a result of the short remaining term (all other
variables remaining constant).

**Currency risk and currency management. A large part of the revenues was generated in the euro-area and was not**
subject to major currency risks. However, currency risks may originate from loans that Techem Energy Services GmbH
grants to its subsidiaries outside the euro-area as part of intercompany financings.

As at September 30, 2022, the following foreign exchange hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting exist:

audited the group management report of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH for the financial year from 1

October 2021 to 30 September 2022.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e
Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these
requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 30
September 2022, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 October 2021 to 30 September
2022, and

the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all
material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements,
complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future
development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to

the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance

with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits

promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our

responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for

the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s

report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and

professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these

requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis

for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management_

_Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in

all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law

pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these

requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the

Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined

necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,

whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s

ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related

to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of

accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic

alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a

whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the

consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the

opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such

arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group

management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide

sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole

are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a

whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the

consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal

requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an

auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group

management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with

§ 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits

promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements

can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably

be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial

statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

  - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the
group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive
to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one
resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.


-----

  - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements
and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in
order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

  - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness
of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

  - Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting
and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we
conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the
related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such
disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause
the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

  - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

  - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business
activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the
group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.

  - Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its
conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

  - Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group
management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the
significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for the prospective information, and
evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a
separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a
substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and

timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we

identify during our audit.

#### B. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Techem 671 mbH and its subsidiaries. In the previous year,
the balance sheet date was changed to the 30[th] of September as it corresponds better to the Company’s business model (this resulted in a
short financial year from April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020). A year-on-year comparison of the financial information of Techem 671 mbH
and its subsidiaries is only possible to a limited extend as the current financial year 2020/2021 includes twelve months while the
comparative period comprises only six months. The short financial year 2020 contains the months with the lower revenues within the
annual cyclical development of Techem’s business.

The consolidated financial statements of Techem 671 Group for the year ended September 30, 2021 have been prepared in accordance with
the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as adopted by the European
Union (EU). In addition, the supplementary regulations in accordance with section 315(e) German Commercial Code have been applied. In
accordance with IFRS, the consolidated financial statements have generally been prepared using the historical cost measurement basis. In
line with IFRS, a different basis has been used in the measurement of purchase price allocations, money market funds, financial instruments,
leases, provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits.

The measurement of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the relevant balance sheet dates, as well
as the amount of income and expenses for the period under review, are influenced by estimates and assumptions made in the preparation
of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Although these estimates and assumptions have been made with the best
knowledge of the management of the Company (specifically in the case of accrued revenues, provisions and intangible assets), actual
figures may ultimately vary from these estimates.

Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are shown in thousands of Euros (€ thousand). Rounding may lead to discrepancies of ± one unit in
the tables.

All standards of the IASB and all the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), which have
to be applied in the EU, that were subject to mandatory application as at September 30, 2021, have been applied by the Company in its
consolidated financial statements.

An amendment of the authorized consolidated financial statements after issue is possible in case of major errors.

The following table presents a revised standard which has to be applied for the first time in the financial year 2020/2021:

**Standard** **Date of mandatory** **Adopted by** **Impact**

#### C. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

**Principles of consolidation. Techem 671 mbH and all German and non-German subsidiaries which can be controlled directly or indirectly by**
Techem 671 mbH are included in the consolidated financial statements. Subsidiaries are all entities which are controlled by the Techem
671 Group. The Techem 671 Group controls an entity when it has power over the entity, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable
returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the amount of the variable
returns.

Investments in associates over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for using the equity method.

All single-entity financial statements fully consolidated into the Techem 671 Group are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting
policies.

Subsidiaries acquired by the Company are accounted for using the acquisition method. The acquisition costs are equivalent to the fair value
of the assets given up on the date of acquisition. For each business combination the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities identified as
part of the business combination are measured at their fair values on the date of acquisition regardless of the extent of the non-controlling
interest. The excess of acquisition costs over the Group’s share in the fair value of the net assets is recognized as goodwill. If the Group’s
share in the fair value of the net assets exceeds the acquisition cost, the remaining excess from a bargain purchase is recognized in the
statement of profit or loss. Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.

When the Group sells shares in a subsidiary and ceases to have control, the difference between the book value of the subsidiary (from a
Group perspective) and the disposal proceeds (after deducting costs of disposal) are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. In
addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income relating to the subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group
had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income
are reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

Consolidation of an entity begins on the date on which control over the entity is obtained by the Company. It ceases when the Group loses
that control.

All intercompany gains and losses, revenue, income and expenses, loans, receivables and payables, provisions, contingent liabilities and
other financial obligations are eliminated. Deferred taxes are recognized using the liabilities method for all temporary differences between
the assets and liabilities tax bases and their carrying amounts.

1) Consolidated using the equity method

2) In liquidation

3) The subsidiary is fully consolidated since according to contractual agreements between the shareholders Techem 671 Group has control.

**Changes to the basis of consolidation**

During the financial year 2020/2021 the Company made the following changes to the basis of consolidation:

  - With a deed dated September 18, 2020, the merger of APJAR-TEVYB s.r.o., Novy Jicin/Czech Republic into Techem spol. s r.o.,
Prague/Czech Republic was decided for October 1, 2020.

  - With a deed dated October 8, 2020, the liquidation of Techem Energy Services India Private Limited, Pune/India, was completed.

  - With effect from November 16, 2020, all shares of Kalorex Gesellschaft mbH, Griesheim/Germany and Exakta Wärme- und
Wasserzähler Service GmbH, Heppenheim/Germany were acquired. With a merger agreement dated July 6, 2021, Kalorex
Gesellschaft mbH was merged into Exakta Wärme- und Wasserzähler Service GmbH. Finally, Exakta Wärme- und Wasserzähler
Service GmbH was renamed into Exakta-Kalorex GmbH, Heppenheim/Germany.

  - On December 7, 2020, all shares in Techem Sverige AB, Malmö/Sweden were sold. The transaction resulted in a loss of €51
thousand which was reported in other expenses


-----

  - Effective December 16, 2020, all shares in VERmax Messtechnik GmbH, Wels/Austria, were acquired.

  - On January 4, 2021, all shares in MessTech GmbH, Krumbach/Germany, were acquired.

  - On January 5, 2021, all shares in maz mess- und abrechnungs-zentrale gmbh, Oberhausen/Germany, were acquired. maz was
merged into BFW Ternes GmbH, Cologne/Germany, on June 9, 2021.

  - Effective May 18, 2021, all shares in MATec Wolski Gesellschaft für Meß- und Abrechnungstechnik mbH, Berlin/Germany, were
acquired.

During the short financial year 2020 the Company made the following changes to the basis of consolidation:

  - With a certificate of incorporation dated April 30, 2020, Techem Energy Services GmbH, Eschborn/Germany founded Techem X
GmbH, Eschborn/Germany. The two companies have a profit and loss transfer agreement since July 3, 2020. Techem X is part of
the German tax group.

**Currency translation. The functional currency of each subsidiary is its local currency. As a result, financial information from foreign**
subsidiaries is translated to Euros as follows: balance sheet figures are translated at the middle rates on the balance sheet date, equity is
translated at the historical rates, and profit or loss figures are translated at average rates for the financial year. Currency translation gains
or losses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income.

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the transaction date. Gains and losses
resulting from such transactions and from the translation at the closing rate of monetary assets and liabilities managed in foreign currency
are recognized in the statement of profit or loss.


-----

#### D. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The balance sheet items are broken down into current and non-current items, non-current items being items for which the maturity is
expected to exceed twelve months.

**Cash and cash equivalents. The Company deems all highly liquid financial investments with an original maturity of up to three months to**
be cash equivalents. These cash equivalents are primarily favorable bank balances realizable at short notice. Additionally, money market
funds are included in cash equivalents. These are recognized at fair value through profit or loss (market value), as the “contractual cash
flow characteristics test” according to IFRS 9 fails. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss as financial income or
finance costs when they are incurred. For cash and cash equivalents, a valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in
accordance with the General Approach of IFRS 9.

**Trade accounts receivable, contract assets, other assets and other financial assets. Current and non-current receivables (trade accounts**
receivable, other assets and other financial assets) and contract assets are measured at fair value on the date of recognition and
subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method (including receivables from installment-based business). The Group
applies the Simplified Approach according to IFRS 9 for the calculation of expected credit losses. Therefore, billed trade accounts
receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables are subject to allowances for expected credit losses over
their entire term. To determine the expected credit losses and incurred losses trade accounts receivable are arranged into groups based on
their maturity and are appropriately impaired based on their age.

Most of the Company’s installment-based business is in Eastern Europe. The receivables from installment-based business are recognized at
their present values.

The Group enters into finance leases as lessor. These leases are primarily leases of heat generation plants and other machinery. To account
for these leases, the Company recognizes a receivable equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments. Payments by the lessee
are treated as repayment of principal and financial income.

Costs to fulfill a contract result from costs accrued in order to align them with the corresponding recognition of revenue for certain
products. The costs to fulfill a contract are recognized as other assets. These are amortized over the contract term and released in the
statement of profit or loss into product expenses and purchased services.

**Inventories. Inventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The cost of inventories is determined mainly on the**
basis of a weighted average. Potential losses resulting from obsolete or non-saleable inventories are accounted for by means of
appropriate write-downs.

**Metering and other devices and property, plant and equipment. Metering and other devices comprise devices, which are used in the**
rental business (including, for example, heat cost allocators, water meters, heat meters, smoke detectors and other devices, which are
installed on the customers’ premises and used as means for the provision of Techem billing services), devices transferred for use and own
tools. Metering and other devices are recognized at cost plus installation costs reduced by depreciation in accordance with IAS 16.

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost reduced by depreciation. Gains or losses on the disposal of property, plant and
equipment are recognized as other income or other expenses.

Any subsidies received are deducted from the cost of the property, plant and equipment concerned and are recognized over the useful life
of the related asset by way of a reduced depreciation charge.

The estimated useful lives used as the basis for straight-line depreciation (pro rata temporis) are as follows:

**Estimated useful**
**life (years)**

Metering and other devices ................................................................................................................................................... 6 to 15
Office furniture and equipment, machinery .......................................................................................................................... 2 to 24
Buildings ................................................................................................................................................................................ 20 to 50
Leasehold improvements ...................................................................................................................................................... 2 to 20
(or shorter
lease term)

If a customer acquires, by corresponding payment, legal title of the metering and other devices when cancelling the rental contract,
resulting gains or losses on this disposal are accounted for as other income or other expenses.

Compensatory payments made by the customer when cancelling the rental contract are recognized as other income, if the legal title of the
metering and other devices is not transferred to the customer. Provided that the Company does not have any alternative use for the
metering devices, their residual values are impaired.


-----

**Intangible assets. Purchased intangible assets are recognized at cost.**

If the requirements under IAS 38 are satisfied, internally generated intangible assets are also recognized at cost. The costs of internally
generated intangible assets mainly include, depending on the project, capitalized own work of employees and the costs of the support by
external partners. These mainly result from the implementation, conception, test and project organization phases of the projects.

Intangible assets are primarily amortized on a straight-line basis (pro rata temporis) over the following useful lives:

**Estimated useful**
**life (years)**

Software, licenses and technology ........................................................................................................................................ 2 to 24
Customer relationships/customer agreements ..................................................................................................................... 13 to 50
Costs to obtain a contract ...................................................................................................................................................... approx. 4 to 15
Other trademarks .................................................................................................................................................................. 3 to 15

The classification of the trademark Techem as an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is based on the fact that Techem has existed
as a trademark since 1952. Brand awareness of Techem is very high in the market and Techem does not plan to abandon this trademark.
Nevertheless, this classification is verified once a year.

Costs to obtain a contract result from variable remuneration of internal staff and from sales or agency commissions to third parties in
connection with the conclusion of customer contracts. The costs to obtain a contract are recognized as intangible asset and presented in a
separate asset category in the Group financial statements. The costs are amortized on a straight-line-basis over the minimum contract
term. For contracts that can be terminated by the customer without penalty at any time, the contract term explicitly stated in the contract
is considered the minimum contract term in that context.

**Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Leases where the Group is the lessee are recognized as a right-of-use asset and corresponding**
liability at the date on which the leased asset is available for use by the Group. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and
finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
asset's useful life and the lease term. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The lease
payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be determined, or the Company’s incremental
borrowing rate.

Payments relating to short-term leases of machinery, where the Group is the lessee, are recognized as an expense in the statement of
profit or loss.

**Recoverability of non-current assets. Property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets, including intangible assets, are tested**
for impairment as soon as events highlight, or there are indicators, that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. An
impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the
recoverable amount being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use of the asset concerned. The value in use is
defined as the present value of estimated future cash flows to be derived from an asset or a cash generating unit (CGU). In accordance with
IFRS 13, the fair value of an asset is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. For the purposes of determining an impairment, assets are grouped together into the smallest group for which
separate cash flows can be identified.

Goodwill, trademark Techem as well as software in progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an impairment test at least
once a year and are not subject to straight-line amortization. The impairment test is carried out for groups of CGUs. Goodwill, the
trademark Techem as well as software in development are measured at their original cost less any accumulated impairment. Impairment
losses recognized for goodwill are not reversed.

**Investments accounted for using the equity method. Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognized initially at**
acquisition cost. After the date of acquisition, the Company’s share of the result from an associate, which is recognized in their statements
of profit or loss, is recognized in the Group statement of profit or loss and it increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment.
The Company’s share of the result from an associate, which is recognized in their statements of other comprehensive income, is recognized
in the Group statement of other comprehensive income and it increases or decreases the carrying amount of the investment. If the
Company’s share of losses in an associate exceeds its interest in them, further losses are not recognized, unless the Company has incurred
obligations on behalf of the associate. The carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method is reduced by profit
distributions made by the associate.

**Non-current accounts receivable. Non-current non-interest-bearing accounts receivable are recognized at present value. For non-current**
accounts receivable, a valuation allowance for expected credit losses is recognized in accordance with the Simplified Approach of IFRS 9.

**Deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the liabilities method. Deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities are recognized for**
temporary differences between the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax accounts, the


-----

result of which will be a future tax refund or tax expense. Deferred tax assets on losses carried forward are recognized to the extent that it
is probable that there will be an available taxable profit against which the temporary difference can be applied.

Deferred tax assets or liabilities are calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which these
temporary differences are expected to reverse. If there is a change in the tax rates, the effect on the deferred tax assets and/or liabilities is
recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the period in which the new tax rate is enacted.

**Provisions. Provisions for pensions and other post-employment benefits are determined in accordance with IAS 19 using the actuarial**
projected unit credit method. This method takes into account, in particular, the current long-term capital market interest rate and current
assumptions regarding future salary and annuity increases in addition to biometric calculation bases. In accordance with IAS 19, the
remeasurements of the provisions for pensions are recognized directly in other comprehensive income. The interest element in the
pension expense is reported under finance costs.

With the exception of the other personnel-related provisions calculated in accordance with IAS 19, all other provisions are recognized on
the basis of IAS 37, providing there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, an outflow of resources
embodying economic benefits is probable and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. The amount recognized is
determined based on the full amount required to settle the probable obligation. Non-current provisions are discounted. The interest
element is reported under finance costs.

**Liabilities. At the time of recognition, liabilities are measured at fair value. They are then subsequently measured at amortized cost using**
the effective interest method. Non-current non-interest-bearing liabilities are discounted. Liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are
translated at the closing rate.

**Derivative financial instruments and hedging. In accordance with IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments are recognized on the balance**
sheet at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. On the trade date of a derivative, it is determined whether this derivative is an instrument to
maintain fair value, to hedge a planned transaction or to hedge against future cash flow fluctuations relating to a recognized asset or a
liability.

Changes in the fair value of the interest rate instruments and the foreign exchange hedging instruments of the Company are recognized as
financial income and finance costs. In these financial statements, the term “hedging instrument” is used from a purely economic
perspective and not based on the definition of IFRS 9.

**Fair value of financial instruments. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, current receivables and current liabilities is virtually the**
same as their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of the money market funds and the Notes is based on quoted market prices on
active markets at the balance sheet date. The fair value of derivatives is equivalent to their fair value at the balance sheet date that is
calculated based on observable market data according to IFRS 13. The fair values of the non-current financial liabilities (except for the
Notes) and the non-current liabilities to shareholders are determined in accordance with IFRS 13 (see note 19).

**Share-based payment. Under the terms of a management participation program, which was set up by one of its main investors, employees**
of the Techem 671 Group (including the most senior management) were given the opportunity to invest indirectly into the Group with their
own cash. This participation program is deemed to be a share-based payment arrangement. It is classified as equity-settled and accounted
for in accordance with IFRS 2.

Any expense arising from an equity-settled share-based payment scheme is recognized as personnel expense in profit or loss with a
corresponding credit to equity. The distribution of the expense is based on the grant date fair value. This fair value will not change later, i.e.
it will not be updated for changes in expectations underlying its determination.

The recognition of expense over time is determined by the vesting conditions of the participation program, particularly service and exit
conditions. Exit conditions are classified as non-market vesting conditions.

**Borrowing costs. In accordance with IAS 23, borrowing costs are capitalized and thereafter amortized over the useful life of the asset.**
Borrowing costs, which are not subject to IAS 23, are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.

**Research and development. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred as part of development projects (mainly being**
software development) are recognized as intangible assets, if it is considered probable that the project will be commercially successful, is
technically feasible and the costs can be reliably determined. Other development costs that do not satisfy these criteria are expensed as
incurred.

**Recognition of revenue from major business activities. The majority of the contracts with customers in the Group are fixed-price**
agreements, under which the Group acts as principal. Revenue is measured at the fixed transaction price agreed in the contracts with
customers. As the Group uses the practical expedient of IFRS 15, the transaction price is only adjusted for the effects of a significant
financing component if the expected period between when the Company transfers goods or services to the customer and when the
customer pays for those goods or services is more than one year. In the Group, this can be applicable for installment sales.
Some contracts in the Group include multiple performance obligations. In this case, the transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices. If they are not directly observable, they are estimated based on the expected
cost plus a margin approach.
For all major products listed below, payment terms may be in advance or in arrears.


-----

**Reading and billing services**
Under reading and billing agreements, the Company provides reading and billing services based on actual consumption figures.
Revenue from reading and billing services is recognized over time as the performance does not create an alternative use to the
customer and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Revenue for reading and billing
services is accrued, using an output-based method of measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of this performance
obligation, to an amount equivalent of the cost of services already rendered plus a profit margin. The calculation is based on the
percentage of completion of the billing process of the flats as at the balance sheet date.

If the reading and billing services rendered by the Company are not completed to date and exceed the payment received from the
customer, a contract asset is recognized. If the payments received from the customer exceed the services rendered by the Company, a
contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some reading and billing agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace a current
agreement with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the statement of financial
position and released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the contract term as, with these payments, no
distinct good or service is acquired from the customer.

**Rental and maintenance services**
Under rental agreements, the Company rents meters to customers for a specific period and ensures functionality and operability of the
meters during the contractual term. Under maintenance agreements, functionality and operability of the meters are ensured for the
customer’s meters during the contractual term. Revenue from rental and maintenance services is recognized over time as the customer
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company as the Company performs. The revenue is recognized
using an output-based measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of these performance obligations on a straight-line basis
over the contractual term.

If rental or maintenance services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a receivable is recognized
as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the customer exceed the services rendered by
the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

In the context of some rental agreements, payments from the Company to the customer occur to replace a current rental agreement
with a competitor. This consideration payable to a customer is recognized as other asset in the statement of financial position and
released as a reduction of revenue in the statement of profit or loss over the contract term to the extent that no distinct good or
service is acquired from the customer. A distinct good or service only exists in the case of the acquisition of functioning meters from a
competitor upon payment to the customer and if these meters are used by the Company to provide services to the customer. In that
case, the payment to the customer is recognized in the position metering and other devices up to the fair value of the acquired meters.

**Sales**
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at a point in time when control of the goods has been transferred to the customer, being
upon delivery. For goods sold, the Company only provides assurance type warranties which do not exceed the legal requirements.

If the goods have been delivered by the Company before the payment is received from the customer, a receivable is recognized as the
Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments are received from the customer before the goods have been
delivered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions (formerly Energy Contracting)**
With the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions, the Company mainly delivers energy (e.g. heat or cooling) to customers. The revenue
from energy deliveries is recognized over time based on output, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of
the energy provided by the Company as the Company performs. The revenue is recognized in an amount that corresponds directly with
the value to the customer of the Company’s performance completed to date.

If Energy Efficiency Solutions services rendered by the Company exceed the payment received from the customer, a receivable is
recognized as the Company’s right to consideration is unconditional. If the payments received from the customer exceed the services
rendered by the Company, a contract liability is recognized.

Expected deductions from revenue (e.g. cash discounts, quantity or trade discounts, non-contractual deductions) have been recognized.

Revenue is reported net of value-added tax and also net of the abovementioned deductions.


-----

**Estimations and assumptions. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires assumptions and estimates to**
be made, which can have an impact on the valuation and disclosure of assets and liabilities, income and expenses, as well as contingent
liabilities.

The Company expects that the measures to contain Covid-19 will have no significant impact on the estimations and assumptions of
Techem. The influence factors resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic are taken into account within the risk assessment (see section F.
OTHER DISCLOSURES - “Concentration of risk”).

The fair values of the assets, which were identified and valued or revalued as a result of purchase price allocations, are based on various
assumptions, such as the future cash flows of the assets as per the business plan, the assumed royalty rate and the relevant discount rates,
adjusted for the Company’s business risk.

The revenue from energy deliveries of the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions as well as the corresponding costs are determined based on
a calculation model, which calculates sales and purchase volumes partially taking into consideration certain estimations (e.g. degree days,
utilization rates).

Assumptions and estimations also relate to the accounting and measurement of provisions. For non-current provisions, the discount rate is
an important estimate. It is based on market yields of high-quality, fixed-rate corporate bonds observable on the financial markets at the
balance sheet date. For pension provisions, assumptions about life expectancy, future salary and pension increases are made.

Valuation allowances on trade accounts receivable are recognized based on their ageing structure. Additionally, receivables which have
been passed to lawyers for recovery are written down. The valuation allowances are calculated using percentages based on historical
experience. Currently, future-oriented information plays a minor role.

Allowances for expected credit losses are recorded for billed trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and
unbilled receivables, based on percentages which reflect the historical write-offs. Allowances for expected credit losses on favorable bank
balances are based on percentages which have been determined based on the default risks of the respective banks.

The recoverability of goodwill and the trademark Techem is assessed based on the future cash flows as per the business plan of the groups
of cash generating units using a discount rate adjusted for the business risk. For further information see note 7.

The useful lives and amortization periods of customer relationships are determined based on historical data. For detailed information see
note 7.

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that the recoverability of future tax benefits is probable. The actual usability of deferred
tax assets depends on the future actual taxable profit situation. This situation may differ from the estimations at the date of capitalization
of the deferred tax assets.

When determining the fair value of financial instruments, assumptions are used that, among other things, are derived from observable
market data. For detailed information see note 19.

The valuation of interest and foreign exchange derivatives is dependent on future interest and exchange rate developments and
assumptions on which these are based.

Through their investment in the management participation program (MEP), employees of Techem 671 Group will share in the proceeds
generated in a future exit event. Since the related claim is based on the value of the company and its equity, respectively, the MEP is
considered a share-based payment within the scope of IFRS 2. In addition, beyond a rather typical investment of shareholders, the MEP
provides for vesting conditions that link the claim to the provision of continued services to the Group up to the time of exit. Therefore, the
participation program is accounted for as a share-based payment under IFRS 2 in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

The future payouts in any of the various exit scenarios will be made to plan participants based on conditions that are equally applicable to
all shareholders for the instruments held. Instruments are settled according to a predefined order. Neither the exit scenarios nor the leaver
scenarios, result in any stand-alone obligation for the Techem 671 Group to settle the MEP, which should be accounted for as a liability
under IFRS 2. Therefore, the MEP is classified as equity-settled. Expenses related to the MEP are only recognized to the extent that a
benefit was granted to plan participants beyond their original investment. The Company has determined the fair values of the MEP
investments at the respective grant dates and compared it to the cash invested by plan participants. Ultimately, the plan participants
invested at fair value at inception date. No benefit was granted to the plan participants. For further details of the valuation, see note 18.

Further explanations concerning estimations and assumptions on which the preparation of this annual report is based are made within the
relevant notes.

All assumptions and estimations made are based on the circumstances as at the balance sheet date. The actual future circumstances may
differ. When this occurs the assumptions are adjusted, and if applicable, the book values of the respective assets and liabilities are also
adjusted.

**Change in estimate of revenue and cost accrual – segment Energy Efficiency Solutions**
As part of continuously improving the processes of the Group and strengthening its internal controls, the intra-annual performance
recording and reporting of the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions (EES) was reviewed and additional analytical tools were implemented.
Techem’s EES business model includes the purchase of energy (e.g. electricity, gas, etc.) from suppliers, which is mostly supplied to the
customers in the form of heat through heat generation facilities. Monthly instalments are paid to suppliers and received from customers
on a linear basis. However, in the income statement, the relevant revenues and the related costs are mainly accrued and recorded
pursuant to a method of estimation which reflects the seasonal nature of energy consumption and heat supply. The improvement of the
processes showed that, on the basis of the information available as a result, more detailed estimates relating to the actual energy
consumptions and deliveries are achievable. As a result, a refined calculation model was applied to the accrual of revenues and costs for
the financial year ending September 30, 2021. The resulting cumulative effects on the financial statements as of and for the year ended
September 30, 2021 are a reduction in total comprehensive income in the low single-digit million range. The effects of the change in these
accounting estimates on subsequent periods cannot be disclosed ex-ante, as these depend on future energy consumption and deliveries as
well as other parameters that cannot be forecast.

1) Including customer relationships from acquisitions in the financial year 2020/2021, for further details see note 27

The useful life of the customer relationships is between 13 to 50 years, based on historical customer loyalty.

In accordance with IAS 36, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (trademark Techem) as well as software in
progress, which is not yet available for use, are subject to an annual impairment test at the balance sheet date. If there are new indicators
during the course of a year that a group of CGUs (“cash generating unit”) may be impaired, an additional impairment test is carried out for
this group of CGUs.

The impairment test is carried out as described below:

The goodwill as well as the other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assigned to the appropriate groups of CGUs.
Energy Services Germany, Energy Services International and Energy Efficiency Solutions each represent one group of CGUs. The
classification of groups of CGUs follows the internal control structure of management.

For each group of CGUs, the recoverable amount is determined. The recoverable amount is measured as the higher of a CGU’s fair
value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If the carrying amount of a group of CGUs exceeds the calculated recoverable
amount an impairment loss must be recognized.

**Energy Services Germany. The recoverable amount of Energy Services Germany is determined on the basis of value in use. The**
future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy Services Germany. The cash flows for
subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.0 percent growth rate (as in the previous year) and a constant cost ratio.
These future cash flows are then discounted to present value. The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital – “WACC”)
was determined using the capital asset pricing model (“CAPM”) and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 6.05 percent
for the group of CGUs Energy Services Germany (short financial year 2020: 6.58 percent).


-----

The five-year plan of Energy Services Germany is based on the following assumptions:

- The growth in revenue results from a systematic further development of the existing products as well as from an extension of
the existing product portfolio and services. Thereby, positive effects are also expected from future regulatory measures relating
to climate change.

- This growth is slowed down by a contract termination rate that corresponds to the market conditions. The average increase in
prices of services is in line with moderate market developments.

- In addition to the increasing revenue, quality improvements and cost savings have a positive impact on EBIT as a result of the
optimization of internal activities and the digitalization of operating processes within the value-enhancing program ENERGIZE-T.

- The planned investments are based on a regular replacement of metering devices and smoke detectors and a moderate
increase resulting from new business. Investments will mainly be made in metering devices as well as smoke detectors and
SMART readers, which are operated using radio technology. As a result, the plan includes an increase in depreciation on
metering and other devices.

As at September 30, 2021, the recoverable amount of Energy Services Germany exceeds its carrying amount by €808,984 thousand.

The key assumptions, on the basis of which the recoverable amount of Energy Services Germany was determined, are as follows:

% **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**

WACC before tax ..................................................................................................................................... 6.05 6.58
Sustainable growth rate .......................................................................................................................... 1.00 1.00
Planned growth in EBIT (average in the five-year plan) .......................................................................... 20.17 20.37
Planned growth in EBITDA (average in the five-year plan) ...................................................................... 9.08 8.56

The following table shows all the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of
the Company, in order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount as at September 30, 2021. The sensitivity
analysis assumes that only one key assumption changes while the other key assumptions remain unchanged.

Percentage points **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**

WACC before tax ..................................................................................................................................... +0.94 +0.73
Planned growth in EBIT (average in the five-year plan) .......................................................................... -7.77 -5.45
Planned growth in EBITDA (average in the five-year plan) ...................................................................... -2.65 -1.73

No other reasonably possible changes in key assumptions were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs
would exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Services International. The recoverable amount of Energy Services International is determined on the basis of value in use.**
The future cash flows of this group of CGUs are calculated based on the five-year plan of Energy Services International. The cash
flows for subsequent periods are based on the assumption of a 1.0 percent growth rate (as in the previous year) and a constant cost
ratio. These future cash flows are then discounted to present value. The discount rate used (weighted average cost of capital –
“WACC”) was determined using the capital asset pricing model and results in a weighted average rate before tax of 6.57 percent for
the group of CGUs Energy Services International (short financial year 2020: 7.65 percent).

The five-year plan of Energy Services International is based on the following assumptions:

- In the mature international markets, a slight but constant growth is expected. This growth is driven by price increases in some
countries while other countries are faced with price pressure.

- For some countries, a stronger growth is expected in the next five years as a result of the introduction of the European Energy
Efficiency Directive (EED), especially beginning with the financial year 2021/2022 in Spain and Poland and beginning with the
financial year 2022/2023 in France.

- Additional growth is expected through a strengthening of the sales team as well as the introduction of new products in some
countries (e.g. EV car charging) as well as from future regulatory measures relating to climate change.

- The main driver of the growth in EBIT is the market growth in the EU countries as a result of the introduction of the EED. In
addition, cost savings are expected in the next five years, for example through reduced reading costs as a result of the increase
in remote reading (Techem Smart System, hereinafter also referred to as TSS), which will be reflected in the results in the
coming years and will be tracked in the Operational Excellence program.

- The planned investments are based on the regular replacement of metering devices in the respective countries and increased
investments in rental equipment as a result of the EED waves mentioned above and the TSS roll-out. This results in an increase
in annual depreciation.

All the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of the Company, were
examined and no cases were identified, by which the carrying amount of this group of CGUs would exceed its recoverable amount.

**Energy Efficiency Solutions. The recoverable amount of Energy Efficiency Solutions is determined on the basis of fair value less**
costs of disposal, which are assumed to be 1 percent of the fair value. To calculate the fair value, the future cash flows are based on


-----

the ten-year plan of Energy Efficiency Solutions. Additionally, expansion investments are included in the calculation. Cash flows
beyond the ten-year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 1.0 percent (as in the previous year). The total future cash flows
are then discounted using the WACC after tax of 4.52 percent (short financial year 2020: 4.93 percent).

The business plan of Energy Efficiency Solutions until the financial year 2030/2031 is based on the following assumptions:

- The growth in EBIT is mainly based on the growth of new business in the real estate sector (existing buildings of housing and
commercial property) and the new buildings sector (especially real estate development business). For the customer segment
“existing buildings”, an increase is planned which results from a sales realignment and the implementation of a strategy to use
a digital platform. This also assumes a further increase in the importance of energy efficiency and thus CO2 avoidance for
customers.

- Beginning with the financial year 2020/2021, a key revenue driver is the platform-based acquisition of contracting business,
which requires no investment and has a high up-selling potential.

- Through the digital platform strategy, the administrative overhead costs are expected to remain constant while the portfolio
growth will be increasing. Additionally, the digital platform strategy is expected to contribute to the increase in energy
efficiency and profitability of the existing plants.

- The growth of EBIT relating to new business is supported by an enhanced average duration of existing contracts. It is planned
that 90% of expiring contracts will be extended due to the new central function customer management.

- Historical price levels are assumed for the main energy source (i.e. natural gas) as well as other energy sources (i.e. heating oil,
long-distance heating, biomethane and wooden pellets).

- The planned investments are based on specific investment ratios used in the construction of heat generation plants, which are
driven by the new business acquired and the safeguarding of the existing business as well as by proposed projects in
conjunction with the platform strategy. With increasing investments, a strong increase in depreciation on machinery is
expected in the coming years.

- As a result of the change in the gas procurement contracts in the financial year 2019/2020, the (accrued) liabilities as at balance
sheet date reduced in comparison with the prior years as the energy obtained during the year was mainly paid to the suppliers
at the financial year-end. This assumption was applied for all future periods for the purposes of the impairment test of Energy
Efficiency Solutions.

The fair value measurement for the CGU Energy Efficiency Solutions is to some extent based on unobservable inputs and is overall
categorized as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13.

As at September 30, 2021, the recoverable amount of Energy Efficiency Solutions exceeds its carrying amount by €36,438 thousand.

The key assumptions, on the basis of which the recoverable amount of Energy Efficiency Solutions was determined, are as follows:

% **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**

WACC after tax ........................................................................................................................................ 4.52 4.93
Sustainable growth rate .......................................................................................................................... 1.00 1.00
Planned growth in EBIT (average in the ten-year plan) ........................................................................... 31.53 22.00
Planned growth in EBITDA (average in the ten-year plan) ...................................................................... 20.77 19.56

The following table shows all the changes in key assumptions, which are assumed to be reasonably possible by the management of
the Company, in order for the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount as at September 30, 2021. The sensitivity
analysis assumes that only one key assumption changes while the other key assumptions remain unchanged.

Percentage points **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**

WACC after tax ........................................................................................................................................ +0.74 +0.74
Planned growth in EBIT (average in the ten-year plan) ........................................................................... -0.99 -1.09
Planned growth in EBITDA (average in the ten-year plan) ...................................................................... -0.43 -0.48

No other reasonably possible changes in key assumptions were identified, by which the carrying amount of this CGU would exceed
its recoverable amount.

to €559,517 thousand as at September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020: €592,384 thousand), which result from the step-ups and the
recognition of assets due to the purchase price allocation in conjunction with the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group on July 31,
2018. They are reduced as a result of the amortization of the assets over their useful lives. They will not affect cash in future. For the
trademark Techem, deferred tax liabilities of €64,342 thousand were recognized as at September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020:
€64,462 thousand).

As at September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the other timing differences shown under deferred tax assets relate mainly to the
balance sheet items property, plant and equipment and other provisions and the other timing differences shown under deferred tax
liabilities on both reporting dates mainly relate to other provisions, property, plant and equipment and inventories.

A tax group exists between Techem 672 mbH, Techem 673 mbH, Techem 674 mbH, Techem 675 mbH, Techem Metering GmbH, Techem

On July 30, 2018, Blitz F18-674 GmbH (later renamed Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH) issued Senior Notes (due 2026) in an
aggregate principal amount of €465,000 thousand. The proceeds of the Senior Notes were used to fund the consideration payable for the
acquisition of the Techem Metering Group and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the related
financing.

Additionally, on July 31, 2018, the 2017 Senior Facilities Agreement of Techem Metering Group was amended, restated and merged with
the Initial Senior Facilities Agreement, which was executed on July 19, 2018 by Blitz F18-675 GmbH (later renamed Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH). At the time, the resulting Senior Facilities Agreement comprised the Facility B in a nominal amount of
€2,340,000 thousand and the Revolving Credit Facility in a nominal amount of €275,000 thousand (both due 2025).

Facility B comprised two tranches, Facility B1 and B2. Amounts under Facility B2 were utilized by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH
and applied in or towards:

(a) financing or refinancing the consideration paid for the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group;
(b) refinancing or discharging any of the existing debt of the Techem Metering Group and paying any related breakage costs,
redemption premium, make-whole costs and other fees, costs and expenses payable in connection with such refinancing or
discharge; and
(c) financing or refinancing the payments of costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Techem Metering Group and all
other fees, costs and expenses relating thereto.

The amount of Facility B1 was equal to certain amounts which had been outstanding under the 2017 Senior Facilities Agreement and had
historically been utilized by Techem Energy Metering Service GmbH & Co. KG (meanwhile all assets and liabilities of this company moved
over by way of succession to Techem Metering GmbH) and Techem GmbH.

In January 2019, the Company repurchased its Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €51,100 thousand on a voluntary basis.

On July 24, 2019, the Company agreed a repricing of its Facility B. As a result of this, the margin existing at that time was reduced from 375
basis points to 350 basis points. For that purpose, Facilities B1 and B2 in an unchanged principal amount were rolled over into the new
Facility B3. This resulted in modification gains of €18,583 thousand due to the revaluation of Facility B. On August 16, 2019, the Company
made a partial repayment of its Facility B in an amount of €50,000 thousand on a voluntary basis.

On January 29, 2020, the Company carried out a refinancing and a further repricing of Facility B, in connection with which Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH issued Senior Secured Notes in an aggregate amount of €1,145,000 thousand (due in July 2025). The
proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes were used in full to partially repay the existing Facility B. As a result of the refinancing and repricing,
Facility B3 in a principal amount of €1,145,000 thousand was rolled over into the new Facility B4. This resulted in modification gains of
€26,143 thousand due to the revaluation of Facility B. Offsetting this, accrued transaction costs and revaluation adjustments amounting to
a total of €23,274 thousand were recognized as expense relating to the repayment of the Facility B in the amount of €1,145,000 thousand.
Furthermore, the maturity dates of Facility B and the Senior Secured Notes were synchronized to July 2025. In the following, the conditions
are explained in detail.

In September 2021, Senior Notes in a nominal amount of €50,000 thousand were repaid (redemption).

As at September 30, 2021, Facility B is fully drawn down with a nominal amount of €1,145,000 thousand. Of the Revolving Credit Facility,
€231,786 thousand are not unutilized (utilized commitments being €40,000 thousand drawn as cash and €3,214 thousand drawn by way of
guarantees). The outstanding principle amount of the Senior Secured Notes is €1,145,000 thousand, the remaining outstanding principle
amount of the Senior Notes is €363,900 thousand as at September 30, 2021.


-----

For both facilities, interest is based on EURIBOR for loans in Euro and LIBOR for non-Euro loans. Until July 2020, the relevant margin
according to the current Senior Facilities Agreement was 287.5 basis points for Facility B and 275 basis points for the Revolving Credit
Facility. Afterwards, the relevant margin may vary between 287.5 basis points and 237.5 basis points regarding Facility B and between 275
basis points and 175 basis points regarding the Revolving Credit Facility, depending on the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio in respect of
the most recently completed twelve-month period preceding the interest payment. In case of a negative EURIBOR the margin will not be
reduced. Effective May 27, 2021, the margin of the Facility B reduced to 237.5 basis points and the margin of the Revolving Credit Facility
reduced to 175 basis points due to the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio test (before, these margins were 262.5 and 200 basis points). The
Company has entered into payer-swap-agreements with a nominal amount of €1,600,000 thousand to hedge the interest rate risks. The
Senior Secured Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 2.000%. The Senior Notes have a fixed coupon rate of 6.000%. As at September 30, 2021,
accrued interest on the Notes amounts to €8,410 thousand.

The loan agreement specifies certain limits for the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. If the ratio lies above these limits, a certain
percentage of an excess cash flow, which is also defined in the agreement and must also be adjusted by extraordinary effects, has to be
used for mandatory prepayments of the Facility B. This excess cash flow has to be calculated yearly for the preceding twelve-month period.
Interest payments on the Facility B are currently made on the basis of the six-month-EURIBOR. As at September 30, 2021, accrued interest
on the loans of the Senior Facilities Agreement amounts to €7,126 thousand.

The liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and certain hedging agreements are secured on a firstpriority basis. The obligations rank pari passu in right of payment with any obligation that is not subordinated.

The liabilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed on a senior basis by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH, Techem Metering GmbH, Techem GmbH, Techem Energy Services GmbH and Techem Solutions GmbH.

**14. Leases**

**The Company as lessee**

The Company leases various properties, IT equipment and cars. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range
of different terms and conditions. Typically, lease contracts are concluded for fixed periods with additional termination or prolongation
options for one or both parties. In some cases, indefinite contract periods with termination options for one or both parties are agreed.

Under the financing arrangements, restrictions regarding lease agreements must be observed. As at September 30, 2021, the Company
complies with the restrictions.

Right-of-use assets resulting from leases where the Group is the lessee are as follows:

**Right-of-use assets ...........................................................................................................................** **111,370** **62,947**

Additions to the right-of-use assets during the financial year 2020/2021 amount to €76,827 thousand (short financial year 2020:
€10,348 thousand). Further additions result from the change in scope amounting to €765 thousand, which relate to the acquisition of
subsidiaries. For further details, see note 27.

The consolidated statement of profit or loss shows the following amounts relating to leases:

€ thousand **2020/2021** **2020**

In the financial year 2020/2021, all the impairment losses related to the segment Energy Services. The impairment losses on right-of-use
assets are included in the position “Depreciation and impairment losses on metering and other devices for rent, property, plant and
equipment, intangible assets and right-of-use assets” of the statement of profit or loss.

The total cash outflow for leases (incl. interest payments) for the financial year 2020/2021 was €22,506 thousand (short financial year
2020: €11,300 thousand).

For further information regarding future undiscounted cash flows (gross), see section F. OTHER DISCLOSURES – “Concentration of risk”.

As at September 30, 2021, potential future lease payments amounting to €38,824 thousand (undiscounted) are not included in the lease
liabilities as it is not reasonably certain that the lease agreements will be extended.

In the financial year 2020/2021, the changes in initial assumptions regarding the exercise of extension and termination options resulted in
a decrease in lease liabilities and right-of-use assets by €6,225 thousand (undiscounted).

As at the balance sheet date, the Company is committed to certain leases for vehicles, which have not yet commenced at this date. In the
financial year 2021/2022, the initial measurement of the right-of-use assets and the lease liabilities from these leases is expected to
amount to €4,269 thousand.

The change in scope of the financial year 2020/2021 results from the acquisition of subsidiaries (€348 thousand) and from the disposal of
the subsidiary Techem Sverige AB, Malmö/Sweden, (-€127 thousand). For further details regarding the acquisitions, see note 27.

The personnel provisions mainly relate to provisions for variable remuneration and outstanding vacation entitlements. Additionally,
provisions for time credits of employees are included, which result from overtime worked.

The provision for warranties mainly relates to obligations due to defective devices, incorrect billing and faulty installation services.

The restructuring provision mainly relates to a program to optimize the functional areas in Germany. The restructuring provision is
calculated according to the social plan, which was agreed with the worker's council, based on a certain number of full-time employees
multiplied by the average personnel costs or the individual personnel costs (as applicable). For various initiatives, especially the actual
numbers of employees concerned, the individual salaries or the number of people resigning by themselves can deviate from the
assumptions above.

Maintenance service provisions have been recognized in order to allow for the exchange of equipment under maintenance agreements.
The provisions only relate to cases where devices covered by maintenance agreements are defective or have exceeded their legal
calibration term but have not yet been exchanged by the Company as at the balance sheet date.

In the financial year 2020/2021, the amount reported under “Other” mainly relates to provisions for contributions to associations,
exchange of devices, which are not in scope of maintenance agreements, renovations as well as provisions for reading and other services.
Additionally, since the financial year 2020/2021, the item also includes provisions for the acquisition of CO2 emission allowances, since the
group must acquire emission allowances for the consumption of fossil fuels for the first time from this reporting period and submit them to
the DEHSt (Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle).

Net exchange differences are not disclosed separately because they are not material. They are included in the “Reversals” column.

The change in scope of the financial year 2020/2021 of €34 thousand results from the acquisition of subsidiaries. For further details, see
note 27.

Generally, a discount rate of 0.91 percent was applied to the provisions (the risk premium was taken into account in the measurement of
future cash outflows).

In the financial year 2020/2021, the amount reported under „Other” mainly relates to provisions for general overhauls, renovations and
dismantling. The reversal in the reporting period mainly relates to provisions regarding renovation obligations for the office building in
Eschborn, which no longer apply after the previous rental contract was terminated and a new rental contract was entered into.

Net exchange differences are not disclosed separately because they are not material. They are included in the „Reversals” column.

**17. Provisions for pensions**

The pension plans of the subsidiaries vary depending on the legal, tax and economic situation in each country.

Most of the pension schemes in place in Germany as well as in other countries are defined benefit plans, some of which are funded and
others unfunded.

There are pension schemes in place for former members of the senior management of Techem Energy Services GmbH and Techem GmbH,
with a separate scheme for each person. These pension schemes are based on the pensionable remuneration of each employee and the
employee's period of service. In addition, the Company has set up a relief fund.

There are also pension plans in place for all active and some former employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG. According to the pension scheme
in Switzerland those plans are funded, respectively reinsured. The pension plans comprise retirement pensions as well as risk benefits
(invalidity and death). The retirement pensions are determined based on the retirement assets and a conversion rate. Risk benefits are
defined as a fixed percentage of insured salary.

The provisions for pensions are computed on the basis of independent actuarial reports. The provisions for defined benefit obligations are
determined using the standard international method known as the Projected Unit Credit Method (in Germany, in conjunction with the
Prof. Dr. Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables).

The funded obligations are supported by suitable qualified insurance policies (pledged reinsurances) that meet the conditions for plan
assets. Accordingly, plan assets are offset against the provisions.

The amount of pension obligations is subject to risks arising in connection with the change in life expectancy, the future amount of pension
adjustments and the development of capital market interest rates. To cover those risks, insurance policies (reinsurances) have been taken
out for some of the defined benefit pension obligations. The reinsurances are mostly not traded on an active market.

1) Positions recognized in other comprehensive income
2) Positions recognized in profit or loss

Since all the pension obligations relating to the employees of Techem (Schweiz) AG which retired during the year under review are covered
by the insurance company, both the present value of the funded obligation and the fair value of the plan assets were each reduced by
€745 thousand in the financial year 2020/2021 (short financial year 2020: €402 thousand each).

The current service costs and past service costs are included in the personnel expenses. The interest costs and the returns on plan assets
are included in the financial result. Remeasurements are recognized in other comprehensive income.

The breakdown of the remeasurements is as follows:

The basic assumptions applied in the computation of the provisions for pensions are as follows (average values):

% **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**

Discount rate .............................................................................................................................. 0.48% 0.36%
Salary increases .......................................................................................................................... 1.85% 1.85%
Annuity increases........................................................................................................................ 0.87% 0.88%

As at September 30, 2021, an average discount rate of 0.65 percent was applied to German defined benefit obligations. For defined benefit
obligations of Techem (Schweiz) AG, an average discount rate of 0.25 percent was applied as at September 30, 2021. The discount rates
applying to non-German defined benefit obligations were between 0.25 percent and 1.9 percent as at September 30, 2021.

The sensitivity of the overall pension liability to changes in the weighted principal assumptions is:

**Assumption** **Change in assumption** **Impact on defined benefit obligation**

Discount rate Increase by 0.25 percentage points Decrease by 3.2 %
Decrease by 0.25 percentage points Increase by 3.6 %

Salary increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 0.9 %
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 1.0 %

Annuity increases Increase by 1.0 percentage points Increase by 8.0 %
Decrease by 1.0 percentage points Decrease by 3.3 %

Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by 3.4 %
Decrease by 1 year Decrease by 3.3 %

The method applied when determining the sensitivities is consistent to that applied when calculating the obligation at the balance sheet
date.

In the financial year 2020/2021, the expenses for contribution-based pension schemes amounted to €13,895 thousand (short financial year
2020: €6,724 thousand), thereof for the German entities €12,226 thousand (short financial year 2020: €5,788 thousand), mainly relating to
the employer's contribution to the statutory pension scheme.

In the financial year 2021/2022, contributions to the plan assets are expected to amount to €1,071 thousand.

The weighted average duration of the pension plans is 14.6 years (short financial year 2020: 17.1 years).

The maturity analysis of the benefit payments is as follows:

**Maturity** **< 1 year** **1-2 years** **2-5 years** **> 5 years**

having a nominal value of €1. The share capital has been paid in full.

**Capital reserves. As at September 30, 2021, the capital reserves include a paid-in capital of €563,127,044 (September 30, 2020:**
€563,127,044).

**Retained earnings. Retained earnings contain the net result of the financial year, the net results generated in the past and the cumulative**
other comprehensive income, consisting of exchange differences, of remeasurements of provisions for pensions as well as of income taxes
on other comprehensive income.

**Capital management disclosures. Among its objectives, Techem 671 Group endeavors to secure its equity base over the long-term and**
generate an appropriate return on capital employed. However, in this regard, the equity as per the Group's balance sheet is only an
indirect management criterion, whereas revenue, EBIT/EBITDA and free cash flow are direct management criteria, whereby the Company
believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

The following table shows the change in equity and financial liabilities:

**Share-based payments/ management participation program (MEP). In March 2019, the main investors implemented a management**
participation program (MEP). This program provides an opportunity to plan participants to invest indirectly in the Group and to share in
any increase in value through their own investment. For this purpose, plan participants acquire a package that consists of a portion of the
shareholder loan (see note 11) as well shares A and B issued by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH. A total of 3,575 shares A and
253 shares B were sold to plan participants as at September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020: 2,319 shares A and 124 shares B were sold to
plan participants). Through their investment plan participants will share in the capital proceeds generated in a future exit event (IPO or
trade sale of the group). The claim represented by the investment is subject to vesting conditions which require services to be provided to
the group until an exit occurs (service condition). If plan participants leave before such exit, they may forfeit all or part of their entitlement.
The investment will then fall back to the investor and may be issued to other or new plan participants. The management participation
program is accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment.

The fair value of the shares granted is measured at grant date. Shares A and B held under the terms of the MEP are treated as options and
are valued using an option pricing model. Shares A and B were last granted in October and November 2020. The life of the options was
estimated to be 6.25 years. All other assumptions were derived consistently from the impairment test. The total value of the MEP shares A
and B held corresponded to the own investment made by plan participants.

For the existing plan participants of the MEP, no expenses have to be recorded either in the period, in which the share are granted, or in
any future periods.

**19. Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities**

Financial assets only contain debt instruments. According to the “SPPI test”, the financial assets except for money market funds generate
cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. Furthermore, according to the “Business model test” these financial
instruments’ cash flows solely result from collecting contractual cash flows (IFRS 9.4.1.2). Therefore, the financial assets except for the
money market funds are recorded at amortized costs. As the “SPPI-test” for the money market funds fails they are measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

The following table provides an overview of carrying amounts and fair values of the financial instruments in the Techem 671 Group in
accordance with IFRS 9 and IFRS 7:

The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value by fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7 and IFRS 13. The
different levels have been defined as follows:

  - level 1: financial instruments traded in active markets for which unchanged quoted prices are taken as measurement

  - level 2: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters derived directly or indirectly from observable
market data

  - level 3: measurement is made by means of valuation methods with parameters that are not based on observable market data

€ thousand **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**

**Sep 30, 2021**

Hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting ................ 0 11,238 0 11,238

**Financial assets .........................................................................** **3,598** **0** **0** **3,598**

Hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting ................ 0 22,635 0 22,635
**Financial liabilities ....................................................................** **0** **22,635** **0** **22,635**

For financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value, no transfers between Level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy occurred in the
financial year 2020/2021.

It is assumed that the fair values of all current items are approximately equivalent to their carrying amounts. The main reason for this is the
short maturity of these instruments.

For non-current other financial assets, non-current trade accounts payable and non-current other financial liabilities the carrying amounts
are approximately equivalent to their fair values.

The fair value of money market funds is based on quoted market prices on an active market at the balance sheet date.

The fair values of hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting (interest rate swaps) are determined using the mark-to-market
valuation method. They are then adjusted by the own credit risk of the Techem 671 Group (or the counterparty credit risk). The expected
exposure to the credit risk is calculated on the basis of mark-to-market valuations made by the counterparty. To determine the credit risk
or rather the probability of default and the loss given default, Techem CDS spreads are used. The credit risk is discounted using term
adequate risk-free interest rates.
The fair values of the Notes are their respective quoted market prices as at September 30, 2021.


-----

The fair value of non-current financial liabilities (loans), measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted cash flow method,
calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used are term adequate risk-adjusted discount rates. The
risk adjustment is made based on the CDS spreads of Techem.

The fair value of non-current liabilities to shareholders, measured at amortized cost, is determined using the discounted cash flow method,
calculating the present value of expected future cash flows. The discount rate used is the internal rate of return of Techem Senior Notes as
at September 30, 2021.

The respective fair values of the Notes mentioned above fall into Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The aforementioned fair values of the
non-current financial liabilities (excluding the Notes) and non-current liabilities to shareholders are attributed to Level 2.

Net gains or losses on financial instruments of the Techem 671 Group consist of the following:

unsatisfied) if they are part of a contract with an original expected duration of one year or less. This mainly relates to sales, maintenance
agreements as well as short-term reading and billing agreements.

Furthermore, transaction prices allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) of the product and
service line Energy Efficiency Solutions are not disclosed as permitted under IFRS 15. For these products and services, the Company
recognizes revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice as it has a right to the consideration from the customer in
an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of its performance completed to date.

financial year 2020: €1,926 thousand) and in product expenses amounting to €73 thousand (short financial year 2020: €0 thousand). The
increase in research and development costs included in personnel costs and other expenses is due to the opportunities offered by
digitization. In cooperation with industrial partners, Techem develops device technologies as well as the necessary end and system devices
for consumption reading, smoke detection (smoke detectors) and for automated and complete digitized stationary remote reading (digital
infrastructure) as well as for remote monitoring of heating systems. In addition, Techem supports several Germany-wide research projects.

As the significant part of the earnings before tax is generated in Germany, the Group weighted average tax rate is 29.98 percent (see
note 9).

Deferred taxes have been calculated using the relevant enacted tax rate.

Income tax liabilities amounted to €9,391 thousand as at September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020: €86,374 thousand). Income tax
liabilities decreased by €76,983 thousand, mainly as a result of advance income tax payments by the German tax group in the amount of
€100,825 thousand for the financial years 2019 to 2021. Offsetting this, a provision for the financial year 2020/2021 of €24,690 thousand
was recorded for the German tax group.

The following table shows the reconciliation from the weighted average tax rate for the Group to the effective tax rate:

**2020/2021** **2020**

**Effective tax expense and tax rate ...............................................................................** **(10,528)** **(14.4)** **10,431** **11.2**

As a result of the German interest barrier rule, the interest expense is not tax-deductible in full. The non-deductible portion of interest
expense is therefore accumulated as interest carried forward. As at September 30, 2021, the interest carried forward amounts to €321,580
thousand (September 30, 2020: €209,981 thousand). No deferred taxes were recognized on the interest carried forward due to the
uncertainty that it can be used during the planning period of five years.

The permanent differences mainly relate to trade tax add-backs relating to interest expense both in the financial year 2021/2020 and in the
short financial year 2020.

The changes in tax rate for deferred taxes in the financial year 2020/2021 mainly result from changes in the trade tax rate from 14.21
percent to 14.15 percent.

**27. Acquisitions**

In the financial year 2020/2021, all the shares in Kalorex Gesellschaft mbH, Griesheim/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Kalorex“),
EXAKTA Wärme- und Wasserzähler Service GmbH, Heppenheim/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “EXAKTA“), VERmax Messtechnik
GmbH, Wels/Austria, (hereinafter also referred to as “VERmax“), MessTech GmbH, Krumbach/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as
“MessTech“), maz mess- und abrechnungs- zentrale gmbh, Oberhausen/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “maz“) and MATec
Wolski Gesellschaft für Mess- und Abrechnungstechnik mbh, Berlin/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “MATec Wolski“) were
acquired. Furthermore, the businesses of CALORSYS Magyarország Kft., Budapest/Hungary, (hereinafter also referred to as “CALORSYS“)
and of Delta-t Messdienst Ralf Paulmann, Ilsede/Germany, (hereinafter also referred to as “Paulmann“ were acquired by way of asset
deals. The main intention regarding these acquisitions is to strengthen the core business at local level. The business of these acquisitions
comprises primarily the reading, consumption-based billing of energy and water consumption as well as the rental and the sale of the
respective devices. A purchase price totaling €27,925 thousand was paid for the acquisition of these companies.

The accounting for these acquisitions is provisional because the determination of the contractually agreed purchase prices has partly not
yet been completed (as a closing balance sheet needs to be drawn up in accordance with the purchase agreement) and in case of the asset
deals mainly because the transfer of part of the customer contracts is expected to take place after the balance sheet date. For the reasons
mentioned, in particular the recorded amount of goodwill and the fixed and intangible assets may still change .

The following table shows the total purchase price and the net cash outflow relating to the above acquisitions:

Less: outstanding purchase price payments ..................................................................................................................... (50)

**Net cash outflow relating to the acquisition ............................................................................................................** **25,873**

**Total purchase price .................................................................................................................................................** **27,925**

1) including trade receivables (gross) of €512 thousand and allowances for these trade receivables of €64 thousand

The goodwill of €9,130 thousand mainly comprises intangible assets, which cannot be identified separately and mainly reflects expected
future growth of earnings as a result of synergies and the increase in the market share in the respective region. It is not tax-deductible.

If the acquired companies and businesses had been part of the Techem 671 Group since October 1, 2020, Group revenues would have
amounted to €821,345 thousand and Group net loss to €82,802 thousand for the financial year 2020/2021. Since joining the Group, the
acquisitions generated total revenues of €4,624 thousand and total net loss of €46 thousand in the reporting period.

Costs directly attributable to the acquisitions amounted to €306 thousand, which were recognized in other expenses.

There were no acquisitions in the short financial year 2020.

#### F. OTHER DISCLOSURES

**Segment reporting**

The segment reporting in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments is prepared due to the issuance of Notes in July 2018 by Techem
Verwaltungsgesellschaft 674 mbH and the issuance of Notes in January 2020 by Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 675 mbH which are
traded in a public market. Both companies are indirect subsidiaries of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH.

Within the segment Energy Services, the Company provides its customers, which mainly comprise service providers in the housing and realestate industry, with measurement, sub-meter reading and billing services relating to energy and water consumption. The reading and
billing services are subject to seasonal fluctuations, which impact the results of operations accordingly.

The Company rents and sells metering devices, which are necessary to provide the services. Rental contracts for the metering devices have
a term of up to ten years.

The Company also offers maintenance services required for the devices. Maintenance services are included in the rental contracts. For sold
devices the maintenance service is offered in separate maintenance contracts.

Techem’s supplementary services include the planning, installation and maintenance of smoke detectors. The smoke detectors are usually
rented to customers. In addition, the Company offers a smoke detector service.

In addition, Techem, in cooperation with SGS Institut Fresenius, offers legionella analysis services in Germany.

The segment Energy Efficiency Solutions represents a further development of our previous segment Energy Contracting. The segment
Energy Efficiency Solutions provides its customers with services in relation to the planning, financing, construction and operation of heat
generation plants. The plants are maintained continuously. Gas, oil, long-distance heating and electricity are provided to the customers. In
the short financial year 2020, the business unit water technology, which comprises the professional operation of water treatment facilities,
was transferred from the segment Energy Services to the segment Energy Efficiency Solutions.

GWE Gesellschaft für wirtschaftliche Energieversorgung mbH was renamed to DMG Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH in November 2020 and
was reallocated to the segment Energy Services from the segment "Other". The prior year figures have been adjusted accordingly.

Consolidation entries are included under "Other".

The accounting principles applied are the same as those applied for the Group. The economic development of the Group and its segments
is managed by means of financial ratios. The financial ratios relevant to the management are revenue, EBIT/EBITDA and free cash flow,
whereby the company believes that EBIT reflects the capital intensity of the business best.

Investments are cash-effective additions to metering and other devices, to property, plant and equipment and to intangible assets.

Intragroup transactions are carried out at market prices.

Techem has no customer with a share in revenue exceeding 10 percent.

To obtain external segment revenues by geographical area, the revenues are allocated to the region where they were recognized. Noncurrent assets are reported based on their location. Non-current assets comprise metering and other devices, property, plant and
equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, non-current other assets and investments accounted for using the equity method.

As a result of similar economic characteristics in the form of similar EBIT-margins for products and services, similar products and services as
well as similar distribution and customer structures, the operating segments Energy Services Germany and Energy Services International
are aggregated into a single reportable segment.

**Concentration of risk**

**Credit risks. The Company offers its services to a large number of customers active in various sectors and geographical regions. The**
Company grants credit terms to eligible customers and believes it is not exposed to an unreasonable concentration of risks.

Imminent or actual irrecoverable receivables are accounted for by write-downs depending on the age of the receivable concerned. Several
dunning stages are also used. When a certain dunning stage is reached, legal action is initiated. Furthermore, allowances for expected
credit losses are recorded with respect to trade accounts receivable, contract assets, finance lease receivables and unbilled receivables.

As at September 30, 2021, the total of trade accounts receivable, including receivables from finance lease (each current and non-current),
is €190,126 thousand (maximum default risk) (September 30, 2020: €179,483 thousand).

The maximum default risk arising from money market funds is their fair value and amounts to €0 thousand as at September 30, 2021
(September 30, 2020: €3,598 thousand).

**Liquidity risk. The Company has secured its financing by long-term loan agreements (Term Loan B due in July 2025 and the Revolving Credit**
Facility due in January 2025) and the issuance of Notes (Senior Secured Notes due in July 2025 and Senior Notes due in July 2026). The
budget of the Company shows a positive development of the financial position, financial result and cash flows. Therefore, the Company is
not exposed to liquidity risk (see note 13).

The following table provides an overview of the maturity analysis for future cash flows of the financial liabilities. The future cash flows are

1) It is assumed that the accrued interest is paid at the end of each interest period.

**Interest rate risk and interest rate management. Interest rate risks arise from the fact that a large part of the financial liabilities is subject**
to a floating rate of interest (see note 13).

Interest rate risk is analyzed centrally and managed by the Treasury department. Interest rate risk items are separated from the liquidity
commitment in individual hedge agreements with the help of interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, and are managed as an
overall portfolio to balance the risks. Interest rate derivatives are used exclusively to optimize credit terms and limit interest rate risks as
part of the Company's financing strategies and are not used for trading or speculation purposes.

Hedging instruments are used in the Group to hedge interest rate risks on variable cash flows. As the swaps fix the variable cash flows on
the loan, they are cash flow hedges, which are not subject to hedge accounting.

The Company pursues a conservative strategy in hedging financial risks. In accordance with internal guidelines of the Company, the use of
derivatives is restricted to the hedging of existing risks. The Company only uses hedging instruments that are measurable and have a
transparent risk profile.

The Indentures of the Senior Notes include termination options, which are derivatives according to IFRS. These derivates have to be
separated from financial liabilities. The termination options can be exercised by the issuer of the Notes in steps until July 30, 2023, each


-----

time taking into consideration a staggered premium on the principal amount. However, the value to be recorded as at September 30, 2021,
is €0 because the options are not in-the-money.

All derivatives are measured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 13. This is determined using the mark-to-market method (for interest rate
swaps), including a credit risk adjustment relating to the counterparty or the Company itself (see note 19). The market values of interest
rate swaps are reported as other financial liabilities.

**Interest rate instruments not subject to hedge accounting. Changes in market value are recognized in the statement of profit or loss, but**
do not affect cash.

As at September 30, 2021, the Company has payer-swaps with a total nominal value of €1,600,000 thousand related to the Facility B and
the Revolving Credit Facility of the Senior Facilities Agreement. These interest rate instruments swap the three-month EURIBOR against a
four-year fixed interest rate of 0.167%.

The aforementioned payer-swaps have the following market values and maturities:

€ thousand **Sep 30, 2021** **Sep 30, 2020**
**Nominal amount** **Market value** **Nominal amount** **Market value**

**Total ..........................................................................** **1,600,000** **(11,238)** **1,600,000** **(22,635)**

1) In this table interest rate swaps are presented according to their contractual term. Liabilities from hedging instruments are shown under current other financial liabilities because
the instruments can be cancelled at any time.

As at September 30, 2021, Facility B has been drawn down with a nominal amount of €1,145,000 thousand. In addition, the Revolving
Credit Facility has been drawn down with a nominal amount of €40,000 thousand as cash. Consequently, these loans with variable interest
charges are fully secured by the interest rate swaps (the interest charge is currently based on the 6-month EURIBOR plus a margin). The
over-hedging amounts to €415,000 thousand. If the 3-month EURIBOR had been higher by one percentage point in the financial year
2020/2021, the Group net loss would have been reduced by €11,333 thousand due to a positive change in the fair value of the interest rate
instruments (all other variables remaining constant).

**Currency risk and currency management. A large part of the revenues was generated in the euro-area and was not subject to major**
currency risks. However, currency risks may originate from loans that Techem Energy Services GmbH grants to its subsidiaries outside the
euro-area as part of intercompany financings.

As at September 30, 2021, the following foreign exchange hedging instruments not subject to hedge accounting exist:

**Risks associated with Covid-19 disease. The worldwide Covid-19 pandemic is categorized as “emergency situation” at Techem. According**
to the management of Techem, the Company is adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic, is resiliently positioned and reacts to this
situation with robust measures. All the employees of Techem are regularly informed about, how high the risk of infection is and how they
as well as third parties can protect themselves against the Covid-19 infection. The current spread of the Covid-19 disease is continuously
recorded and assessed by the Corona emergency staff of the Company. Accordingly, the internal current risk assessments and current
safety measures are compared with the evaluations and assessments of the Robert Koch-Institute. To coordinate the measures in the
Group, the Corona emergency staff was assembled, which is coordinated by the Head of Quality & Methods and which is technically
supported by an external BCM consultancy firm (Business Continuity Management). Within the incident management, possible incidents
are collected and necessary actions are initiated. The Covid-19 crisis management is also prepared should the situation in Germany further
deteriorate. In principle, appropriate precautions have been taken at all locations in Germany and abroad. If necessary, local peculiarities
were also taken into consideration. The local planning regarding the pandemic is carried out in coordination with the centralized Corona
emergency staff based on the individual circumstances at each location. Business critical circumstances are identified and secured against
default risks In addition a continuous exchange of information between the Company and its shareholders takes place Within this scope


-----

the analysis of the actions to be taken as well as the evaluation of mitigation measures related to operating activities and measures related
to liquidity protection (based on different scenarios) take place.

In the financial year 2020/2021, the Covid-19 pandemic did not have any material impact on the financial position and results of operations
of the Group. However, additional costs were incurred during that period relating to Covid-19. These costs amounted to €4,721 thousand
and mainly related to the purchase of safety/ protective equipment and disinfectants as well as the provision of a home office allowance
for employees working from home. It is expected that the government’s measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic will not have a
material impact on the economic activities of Techem given the infrastructure-like nature of its business and given that in Germany almost
80% of meters can be read remotely. In addition, the preparation of corresponding billings can be performed remotely. Recently, the
inventory was also increased to ensure product availability. At the moment, there are no indications of significant changes in the payment
behavior of our customers. As the situation evolves, the Covid-19 measures and the overall impact of Covid-19 on the operations and
financial performance of the Company are continuously assessed.

management report (Konzernlagebericht) of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn, as of and for the financial year ended

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn

_Audit Opinions_

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft 671 mbH, Eschborn, and its subsidiaries

(the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 September 2021 and the consolidated

statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the

financial year from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary

of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of Techem Verwaltungsgesellschaft

671 mbH for the financial year from 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the
additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch:
German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at 30 September 2021, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 October
2020 to 30 September 2021, and

the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material
respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal
requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal

compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report.

_Basis for the Audit Opinions_

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with § 317 HGB

in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der

Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are

further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group

Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements

of German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with

these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our

audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report_

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material

respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB

and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets,

liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such

internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to

continue as a going concern They also have the responsibility for disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern In


-----

addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to

liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides

an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements,

complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In

addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary

to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to

be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report_

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from

material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an

appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the

knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and

risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial

statements and on the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with § 317 HGB and

in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der

Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on

the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and
measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the reasonableness of estimates made by the
executive directors and related disclosures.

Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit
evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group
management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group
to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and
whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated
financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group
in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e
Abs. 1 HGB.

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the
Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit
opinions.

Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German
law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.


-----

Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors in the group management report. On
the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive
directors as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from
these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as
a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit

and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
