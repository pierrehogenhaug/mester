Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities offered under the Offering Memorandum will be relying on the exemption

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose possession the Offering Memorandum
may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering
Memorandum to any other person.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities
in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The materials relating to the Offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where offers or solicitations are
not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and any of the Initial Purchasers of the securities offered
under the Offering Memorandum or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be made
by such Initial Purchaser or affiliate thereof on behalf of the issuer in such jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved by an authorized person in the UK and is only being distributed to and is only directed at persons who (i) have
professional experience in matters relating to investments and are investment professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as amended (the “Order”), (ii) are high net worth companies, and other persons to whom it may lawfully be communicated,
falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, (iii) are outside the UK, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity
within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”) The Offering Memorandum must not

relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons. No part of the Offering Memorandum should be published, reproduced, distributed or otherwise
made available in whole or in part to any other person.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the
FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be altered or changed during
the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the Initial Purchasers, any person who controls any Initial Purchaser, the Issuer, the Guarantors
(each as defined in the Offering Memorandum) or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates, accepts any liability or responsibility
whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and any version that will be provided to you at a
later date upon your request from any Initial Purchaser.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target**
market assessment in respect of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible
counterparties (“ECPs”) and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should
take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, and without prejudice to the Issuer’s obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) retail investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended**
to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning
of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption
under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the
securities. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**Prohibition Of Sales To UK Retail Investors: The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the
FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the UK has been prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum in the UK will be made pursuant
to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**The Offering Memorandum is being distributed for information purposes only and is subject to completion and amendment (which may be material)**
**without notice. The definitive terms of the transaction will be described in the final version of the Offering Memorandum. The Offering Memorandum**
**shall not, and is not intended to, constitute or contain any offer or invitation to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy and may not be used as, or in**
**connection with, any offer or invitation to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy any of the securities described therein.**

price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium,
as described in this offering memorandum (the “Offering Memorandum”). Prior to         , 2023, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes

Issuer may redeem all or part of the Fixed Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus        % per annum (the “FRN Margin”), reset quarterly. The Floating Rate Notes will
mature on       , 2027. The Issuer will pay interest on the Floating Rate Notes quarterly in arrears                                 on        ,        ,         , and          of each
year, commencing on              , 2021. Prior to          , 2022, the Issuer may redeem, at its option, all or a portion of the Floating Rate Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the

Offering Memorandum. At any time on or after             , 2022, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Floating Rate Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, all, but not less than all, of the applicable series of Notes may also be redeemed upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon the occurrence of certain events defined
as constituting a change of control, the Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. However, a change of control will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with
such event.

The Notes will (i) be general senior obligations of the Issuer, (ii) rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is not subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations, (iii) rank senior in
right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (if any), (iv) be effectively subordinated to any existing

subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes, including obligations to trade creditors.

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis (the “Note Guarantees” and, each, a “Note Guarantee”) by the Guarantors (as defined
herein). The Issuer and the Guarantors will also guarantee, on a senior secured basis, the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will (i) be a general senior obligation of
such Guarantor, (ii) rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantees, including_
obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain cash management obligations, (iii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness
of such Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Note Guarantees, (iv) be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by
property and assets that do not secure the Note Guarantees, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness (if any), and (v) be structurally subordinated to any existing or
future obligations of the subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by the Collateral (as defined herein) on a first-priority basis. The Collateral will also
secure the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture on a first-priority basis.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, liabilities in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain other future
indebtedness permitted under the Indenture that are secured by the Collateral will be repaid with the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or the enforcement of, the Collateral in priority to the Notes.
The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations described in “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations
_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests” The Collateral and the Note Guarantees may be released in certain circumstances._

The Notes will initially be issued in the form of global notes in registered form. The Notes will be in registered form in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 above
€100,000. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” We expect the Notes to be delivered to investors in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A.
(“Clearstream”), on or about the Issue Date.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the
Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.

##### IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”) has been prepared by us solely for use in
connection with the proposed offering of the Notes described in this Offering Memorandum (the
“Offering”) and should be used solely for the purposes for which it has been produced. Distribution of
this Offering Memorandum to any person other than the prospective investor and any person retained
to advise such prospective investor with respect to the purchase of Notes is unauthorized and any
disclosure of any of the contents of this Offering Memorandum without our prior written consent is
prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, agrees to
the foregoing and agrees to not make copies of this Offering Memorandum or any documents referred
to in this Offering Memorandum.

In making an investment decision, prospective investors must rely solely on the information contained
in this Offering Memorandum and their own examination of the Issuer and its subsidiaries and
businesses and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved. Neither we nor any
of the Initial Purchasers has authorized any other person to provide different information to any investor
or potential investor and we do not take responsibility for any information that others may give to you.
In addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Security Agent (each as defined
herein), nor any of their respective agents, are making any representation to prospective investors
regarding the legality of an investment in the Notes, and prospective investors should not construe
anything in this Offering Memorandum as legal, business or tax advice. Prospective investors should
consult their own advisers as to legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of an investment in
the Notes. Prospective investors must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which they
buy, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum; neither we nor any of
the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Security Agent shall have any responsibility for any of the
foregoing legal requirements. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

We are offering the Notes in reliance on an exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) for an offer and sale of securities that does not involve a
public offering. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be
transferred or resold except as permitted under the Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any
other jurisdiction pursuant to registration or exemption therefrom. Prospective purchasers should be
aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of
time. If you purchase the Notes, you will be deemed to have made certain acknowledgments,
representations and warranties as detailed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction in
which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such
offer or solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction
where action would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold,
directly or indirectly, nor may this Offering Memorandum be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in
accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction.

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We are making the Offering subject to the
terms described in this Offering Memorandum and the purchase agreement relating to the Notes entered
into between us and the Initial Purchasers. We and the Initial Purchasers may reject any offer to
purchase the Notes in whole or in part, sell less than the entire principal amount of the Notes offered
hereby or allocate to any purchaser less than all of the Notes for which it has subscribed. The Initial
Purchasers and certain of their respective related entities may acquire, for their own accounts, a portion
of the Notes.

This Offering Memorandum contains summaries of various documents governing the Notes, believed
to be accurate, of some of the terms of specific documents, but reference is made to the actual documents
for the complete information contained in those documents. You should contact the Issuer or the Initial
Purchasers with any questions about this Offering. All summaries contained herein are qualified in their

entirety by this reference. The contents of any website, including the website of the Sponsor, the Issuer
or any member of APCOA, do not form any part of this Offering Memorandum.

The information contained in “Exchange Rate Information,” “Summary,” “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry” and “Business” includes_
extracts from information and data, including industry and market data and estimates, released by thirdparty industry publications. Although the Issuer accepts responsibility for the accurate extraction and
summarization of such information and data, the Issuer has not independently verified the accuracy of
such information and data and it accepts no further responsibility in respect of such information and
data.

In addition, the information set forth in relation to sections of this Offering Memorandum describing
clearing arrangements, including under “Description of the Notes” and “Book-Entry, Delivery and
_Form,” is subject to any change in, or reinterpretation of, the rules, regulations and procedures of_
Euroclear and Clearstream currently in effect. While the Issuer accepts responsibility for accurately
summarizing the information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, it accepts no further responsibility in respect of such information.

The Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and the Security Agent make no representation or warranty, express
or implied, as to, and assume no responsibility for, the accuracy or completeness of the information
contained in this Offering Memorandum. Nothing contained in this Offering Memorandum is, or shall
be relied upon as, a promise or representation by any of the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee or the Security
Agent as to the past or the future.

By receiving this Offering Memorandum, you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to ask
questions of us, and that you have received all answers you deem necessary to verify the accuracy and

of this information or your decision whether to invest in the Notes.

Interests in the Notes will be available initially in book-entry form. We expect that the Notes sold will
be issued in the form of one or more global notes. The global notes will be deposited and registered in
the name of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream. Transfers of interests in the global
notes will be effected through records maintained by Euroclear and Clearstream, respectively, and their
respective participants. The Notes will not be issued in definitive registered form except under the
circumstances described in the section “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

There is currently no market for the Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on
the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that
the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the Notes
will be granted or that such listing will be maintained. The Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant
to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended.

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any U.S. state securities
commission nor any non-U.S. securities authority or other authority has approved or disapproved of the
Notes or determined whether this Offering Memorandum is truthful or complete. Any representation to
the contrary is a criminal offense in the United States.

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one
else. Accordingly, in connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers will not be responsible to
anyone other than the Issuer for providing the protections (regulatory or otherwise) afforded to their
clients or for the giving of advice in relation to the Offering.

This Offering Memorandum is being provided (1) to a limited number of U.S. investors that the Issuer
reasonably believes to be “QIBs” under Rule 144A for informational use solely in connection with their
consideration of the purchase of the Notes and the Note Guarantees and (2) outside the United States in

Guarantees described in this Offering Memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by
or approved by the SEC, any state securities commission in the United States or any other securities
commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any state securities commission in the United
States or any such other securities commission or authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of

**NOTICE TO CERTAIN EUROPEAN INVESTORS**

**European Economic Area**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that all offers of the Notes will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to produce a prospectus
for offers of the Notes. The expression “Prospectus Regulation” means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as

##### iv


-----

amended or superseded), and includes any relevant implementing measure in each member state (“EU
Member State”) of the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Accordingly, any person making or intending to make any offer within the EEA of the Notes should
only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or the Initial Purchasers to produce a
prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do authorize, the
making of any offer of Notes through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the Initial
Purchasers, which constitute the final placement of the Notes contemplated in this Offering
Memorandum.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a “retail investor”
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of
Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

For the purposes of this section, the expression an “offer of notes to the public” in relation to any Notes
in any EU Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide
to purchase or subscribe the Notes, as the same may be varied in that EU Member State by any measure
implementing the Prospectus Regulation in that EU Member State.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of**
each manufacturer’s approval process of the Notes, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes
has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes
to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturer’s target
market assessment; however, and without prejudice to our obligations in accordance with MiFID II, a
distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Austria**

The Offering is not a public offering in the Republic of Austria. The Notes may not be offered and sold
in the Republic of Austria except in accordance with the provisions of the Capital Market Act of the
Republic of Austria (Kapitalmarktgesetz) (as amended, the “Austrian Capital Market Act”), the
Prospectus Regulation and any other laws applicable in Austria. No application will be made under
Austrian law to permit a public offer of the Notes in the Republic of Austria. This Offering
Memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to, nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the
Austrian Financial Market Authority (Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde) (“FMA”). FMA has not obtained
and will not obtain a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the European
Union (each, a “Member State”), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to
Article 25 of the Prospectus Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Austria by way of a
public offer, public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this Offering Memorandum and any
other document relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to
the public in Austria or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in
Austria. Consequently, in Austria the Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum
and any other offering material in relation to the Notes is directed only at, persons who are qualified

investors (qualifizierte Anleger) within the meaning of Section 1 Paragraph 1 No. 6 of the Austrian
Capital Market Act in connection with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation or who are subject

in Austria may only be made in accordance with the Austrian Capital Market Act, the Prospectus
Regulation and other applicable laws.

Further it is not intended that the Notes will be available in Austria to qualified investors (qualifizierte
_Anleger) within the meaning of Section 1 Paragraph 1 No. 6 of the Capital Market Act in connection_
with Article 2 lit. e of the Prospectus Regulation. Therefore, no notice pursuant to Section 24 of the

Notes) in Austria has to file a notice to the Oesterreichische Kontrollbank Aktiengesellschaft in its
function as notification office, will be submitted.

Germany. No application will be made under German law to permit a public offer of the Notes in the
Federal Republic of Germany. This Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be submitted to,
nor has it been nor will it be approved by, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority
(Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) (“BaFin”). BaFin has not obtained and will not obtain
a notification from another competent authority of a member state of the European Union (each, a
“Member State”), with which a securities prospectus may have been filed, pursuant to Article 25 of the
Prospectus Regulation. The Notes must not be distributed within Germany by way of a public offer,
public advertisement or in any similar manner, and this Offering Memorandum and any other document
relating to the Notes, as well as information contained therein, may not be supplied to the public in
Germany or used in connection with any offer for subscription of Notes to the public in Germany.
Consequently, in Germany the Notes will only be available to, and this Offering Memorandum and any

Republic of Italy (“Italy”) and the Offering has not been submitted to the clearance of the Commissione
_Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (“CONSOB,” the Italian securities and exchange commission)._
Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, in Italy, and neither
this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering circular, prospectus, form of application,

profession may in certain circumstances be entitled to request that the purchase be declared void unless

commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada in connection with the offer and sale of the Notes.
No securities commission or similar regulatory authority in Canada has reviewed or in any way passed

purchaser (i) is purchasing as principal, or is deemed to be purchasing as principal in accordance with
applicable Canadian securities laws, for investment only and not with a view to resale or redistribution;
(ii) is an “accredited investor”; and (iii) is a “permitted client.” Any resale of Notes acquired by a
Canadian purchaser in the Offering must be made in accordance with applicable Canadian securities
laws, which may vary depending on the relevant jurisdiction, and which may require resales to be made
in accordance with Canadian prospectus requirements, a statutory exemption from the prospectus
requirements, in a transaction exempt from the prospectus requirements or otherwise under a
discretionary exemption from the prospectus requirements granted by the applicable local Canadian
securities regulatory authority. These resale restrictions may under certain circumstances apply to
resales of the Notes outside of Canada. Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada
may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this Offering Memorandum
(including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation, provided that the remedies for
rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities
legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable
provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these
rights, or consult with a legal advisor. Canadian purchasers are advised that this document has been
prepared in reliance on Section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33105”). Pursuant to section 3A.3 of NI 33-105, this document is exempt from the requirement that the

Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as
amended (the “Financial Promotion Order”), (iii) are persons falling within Articles 49(2)(a) to (d) of

-----

Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes may otherwise be lawfully
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant
persons”). This Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or
relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with
relevant persons. Any person who is not a relevant person should not act or rely on this Offering
Memorandum or any of its contents.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the UK will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK
Prospectus Regulation.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of
Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a
qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been
prepared and, therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

##### PRESENTATION OF INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA

This Offering Memorandum contains statistics, data, estimates and other information relating to
markets, market sizes, market shares, market positions and other industry data pertaining to our business
and end-markets. Unless otherwise indicated, such information is based on our analysis of multiple
sources, including industry publications, surveys and industry reports prepared by consultants, internal
surveys and customer feedback.

To the extent that information presented in this Offering Memorandum was taken from third-party
sources, such information has been accurately reproduced by us in this Offering Memorandum, and, as
far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information published by relevant third parties, no
material facts have been omitted which would render the information provided inaccurate or misleading.
Market studies, statistics, estimates and analyses are, however, inherently predictive and subject to
uncertainty and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions, are frequently based on
information and assumptions that may not be accurate or technically correct, and their methodology
may be forward-looking and speculative. In particular, market studies, statistics, estimates and analyses
are based on market research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the
researchers and the respondents, including judgments about what types of products and transactions
should be included in the relevant market. Industry publications or reports generally state that the
information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and
completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified the figures,
market data and other information used by third parties in the studies, publications and financial
information reproduced herein, or the external sources on which our estimates are based. We therefore
assume no liability for and offer no guarantee of the accuracy of the data from studies and third party
sources contained in this Offering Memorandum or for the accuracy of third party data on which our
estimates are based.

Certain industry data presented in this offering memorandum was prepared prior to or concurrently with
the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020 and has since had a material effect
on the markets and sectors in which we operate our business. Such industry data has not been updated
to account for the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers make any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of any such data or information
in this Offering Memorandum and you should not place undue reliance on such data and information.

The market projections and other forward-looking statements in this Offering Memorandum are not
guarantees of future performance. Actual events and circumstances could differ materially from current
expectations and numerous factors could cause or contribute to such differences. See “Risk Factors”
and “Forward-Looking Statements.”

##### PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION

**Historical Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes the historical consolidated financial statements listed below
(together, the “Financial Statements”):

- the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, including comparative information for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 (the “Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements”),
which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS,

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020, and the related notes thereto, including comparative information for the
year ended December 31, 2019 (the “2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements”), which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, and

- the audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019, and the related notes thereto, including comparative information for the
year ended December 31, 2018 (the “2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements” and
together with the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, the “Audited Consolidated
Financial Statements”), which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH
Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, independent auditors, who issued an auditor’s report thereon. The
auditor’s report issued on the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements contains an emphasis of
matter paragraph concerning the material uncertainty related to the ability of the Group to continue as
going concern due to the ongoing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Risk Factors—In the
_auditor’s report on our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements there was attention drawn to_
_uncertainty on the future and the impact that could have on continuing as a going concern.” See_
“Independent Auditors” for a description of the report of our independent auditors on the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The label “audited” is used in this Offering Memorandum to indicate financial information that has
been taken from the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. The label “unaudited” is used in this
Offering Memorandum to indicate financial information that (i) has not been taken, but derived from
the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, (ii) has been taken or derived from the Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements, (iii) has been taken or derived from the Issuer’s
accounting records or (iv) has been taken or derived from the Issuer’s internal management reporting
systems. Such financial information should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates and judgments in addition to those involved in preparing the Financial Statements.
IFRS requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The
areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates
are significant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements
included in this Offering Memorandum and in the section “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirement of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the
SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC.

##### xix


-----

**Basis of Preparation**

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum was prepared in accordance with
IFRS and was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States (“U.S. GAAP”). There could be significant differences between IFRS, as applied by us, and U.S.
GAAP. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile our IFRS
financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and
investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The financial information included
in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with SEC reporting requirements. Compliance
with such requirements would require the modification, reformulation or exclusion of certain financial
measures. In addition, changes would be required in the presentation of certain other information.

**Comparability of the Financial Statements**

**_Adoption of IFRS 16_**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB published IFRS 16, and the European Union adopted IFRS 16 on
November 9, 2017. We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019. Under IFRS 16, we recognize
lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as “operating leases” under
the principles of IAS 17 “Leases.” We recognize a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the
underlying asset and a lease liability representing our obligation to make lease payments. We elected to
apply the modified retrospective approach on transition to IFRS 16, and as such the cumulative effect
of initially applying the standard was recognized at the date of initial application, January 1, 2019,
without an adjustment to our prior-year results. The adoption of IFRS 16 had an impact on our balance
sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. As a result, the comparability of our income
statement information between these periods is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1,
2019, resulted in an increase of interest expense on leases, an increase of depreciation of lease assets
and a decrease of rent expense on operating leases. In addition, the comparability of our balance sheet
information between these dates is limited because our adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, resulted
in an increase in current and non-current other financial liabilities. To facilitate a comparison of our
results of operations and financial condition across periods and irrespective of the applicable lease
accounting standard, we present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information for the
years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, and the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021 on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, which has been adjusted to exclude the
impact of IFRS 16. In addition, we believe this Pre-IFRS 16 financial information reflects our financial
condition and financial performance in a more accurate manner than under IFRS 16. These figures have
not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and
are presented for illustrative purposes only. See “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data” and
the Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**_COVID-19_**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our business. As a result, the comparability of our
results for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021
with the relevant corresponding periods in 2019 and 2020, respectively, is limited. In addition, the
COVID-19 pandemic may impact comparability of past results with future periods. See “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—COVID-19 Impact on Our_
_Business” and “Summary—Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” To provide investors with a more_
normalized overview of our business and results of operations, in this Offering Memorandum, we
mainly present and discuss operational and financial data as of and for the year ended December 31,
2019, which was the last full period under discussion that was unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Revision of the 2019 Financial Information**

On January 1, 2019, we applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time. In this context, rental payments for
airports in Norway were classified as quasi-fixed under IFRS 16.B42(a)(ii). In the 2020 Audited

##### xx


-----

Consolidated Financial Statements, we determined that this classification was inaccurate as the
payments are variable payments that are not included in the lease payments for purposes of calculating
the lease liability and, subsequently, the right-of-use asset. Rather, variable lease payments that are not
included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognized by the lessee in profit or loss in the
period in which the event or condition that triggers these payments occurs (IFRS 16.38). As a
consequence, the calculated deferred taxes also changed. Accordingly, our balance sheet as of
December 31, 2019 overstates items of assets as well as liabilities and in the consolidated statement of
comprehensive income, depreciation for rights of use assets and the interest expense for lease liabilities
are reduced. Previously, lease expenses as well as expenses for materials and purchased services for
office rent and incidental expenses were reported under other expenses. From the year ended December
31, 2020 onwards, lease expenses, expenses for materials and purchased services for office rent and
incidental expenses are reported directly in their own line items, and the previous years are adjusted
accordingly. In addition, the adjusted consolidated cash flow statement shows a reduced cash flow from
operating activities, while the cash flow from financing activities is relieved of interest and repayments
of the lease liability, with net cash flow remaining unchanged. For a reconciliation, see note 9 to our
2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Accordingly, our historical financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019
presented in this Offering Memorandum has been extracted from the comparative column in our 2020
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and differs from the historical financial information as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented in our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**Financial Information Presented for the Twelve Months ended March 31, 2021**

The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 set forth in this Offering
Memorandum was derived by adding the Issuer’s financial information for the year ended December
31, 2020 to its interim financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and subtracting
its financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The financial information for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors and is not
required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting
principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. This information is not necessarily
representative of our results of operations for such period or any future period or any financial position
at any past or future date. See also “—Non-GAAP Measures.”

**Unaudited and Unaudited As Adjusted Financial Information**

We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited historical financial information for the
two months ended May 31, 2020 and 2021. In addition, in this Offering Memorandum we also present
certain as adjusted financial information as of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
including as adjusted senior secured net debt, as adjusted total net debt and as adjusted cash interest
expense, which has been prepared to illustrate the effect of the Transactions on the Issuer’s debt position
and cash interest expense as if the Transactions had occurred (i) on March 31, 2021, in the case of as
adjusted financial information derived from information included on our balance sheet, and (ii) on April
1, 2020, in the case of as adjusted financial information derived from information included on our
income statement. See also “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data.” The unaudited as
adjusted financial data presented herein does not purport to project our results as of any future date or
for any future period. The unaudited historical financial information, the adjustments to the Issuer’s
unaudited as well as audited historical financial information as well as the unaudited as adjusted
financial data set forth in this Offering Memorandum are based on available information and certain
assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual
adjusted amounts. These as adjusted measures are not financial measures defined in accordance with
IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

##### xxi


-----

The unaudited as adjusted financial information included herein should be read in conjunction with
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Neither the unaudited historical financial information nor the adjustments to the historical financial
information nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in
accordance with applicable auditing standards, and this financial data has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation.
The unaudited as adjusted financial information is not directly comparable to the historical consolidated
financial information of the Issuer presented in this Offering Memorandum.

**Non-GAAP Measures**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-GAAP measures and ratios, including EBT, EBIT,
EBITDA, EBITDA excluding effects from the application of IFRS 16, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA,
Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margin and Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA (collectively,
the “EBITDA Measures”), as well as capital expenditures, adjusted free cash flow (before expansion
capital expenditure), adjusted free cash flow, adjusted cash conversion, adjusted operating cash flow,
Contract Contribution and other measures and ratios that are not required by, or presented in accordance
with, IFRS (collectively with our EBITDA Measures, the “Non-GAAP Measures”). In addition,
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted
EBITDA as presented in this Offering Memorandum differ from the definition of “Consolidated
EBITDA” that will be contained in the Indenture. Such Non-GAAP Measures are presented based on
information derived from the Financial Statements, our historical accounting records and our internal
accounting system.

We believe the Non-GAAP Measures provide supplemental information which may be useful in the
review of the Issuer’s financial performance described in this Offering Memorandum and are useful
metrics for investors to understand our results of operations and profitability because they permit
investors to evaluate our profitability from underlying operating activities. We also use these measures
internally to establish forecasts, budgets and operational goals to manage and monitor our business, as
well as to evaluate our underlying historical performance. For a description of how the Non-GAAP
Measures are calculated from our consolidated results of operations and a reconciliation of the NonGAAP Measures to our results of operations for the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum,
see “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data.”

We believe the Non-GAAP Measures facilitate operating performance comparisons between periods
and among other companies in industries similar to ours because they remove the effect of variation in
capital structures, taxation, and non-cash depreciation, amortization and impairment charges, which
may be unrelated to operating performance. We believe the Non-GAAP Measures better reflect our
underlying operating performance because they exclude the impact of items which are not related to
our core results of operations, including certain one-off or non-recurring items. The Non-GAAP
Measures or comparable measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other
interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to us, many of which present EBITDA
Measures when reporting their results.

The Non-GAAP Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are based on assumptions, opinions,
estimates, projections and forecasts which involve known and unknown operational, business,
economic, regulatory and other risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results,
performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such Non-GAAP Measures. These Non-GAAP Measures have
been prepared, in good faith, based on numerous assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the
Issuer at the time of preparation, may or may not prove to be correct or necessarily take place.

##### xxii


-----

In addition, the Non-GAAP Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider
them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results or any directly comparable financial
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS as set forth in the Financial Statements. Some of these
limitations are:

- not all of them reflect our cash expenditures and they do not reflect our future requirements for
capital expenditures on contractual commitments;

- they may include cost savings which are based on various assumptions that we consider
reasonable, but these cost savings may not be achieved in the expected timeframe, or at all, as
a result of future unexpected changes in our business or other factors;

- assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be
replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements;

- they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

- they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on our debt;

- they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

- they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our
consolidated statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income;

- they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider
not to be indicative of our ongoing operations;

- some of the non-recurring items that we eliminate in calculating certain EBITDA Measures
reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; and

- other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting
their usefulness as comparative measures.

Because of these limitations, the Non-GAAP Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying
primarily on our IFRS results and using the Non-GAAP Measures only supplementally to evaluate our
performance. See “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Data,” “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Financial Statements and the notes_
thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Exchange Rate Information**

The majority of our sales revenues is denominated in currencies other than the euro, which is the Issuer’s
presentational and functional currency. The individual financial statements of each subsidiary of the
Issuer are presented in their functional currency. For more information on our currency exchange rate
exposure, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management—Currency_
_Risks.”_

The results of operations and cash flows of subsidiaries which have non-euro functional currencies are
translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. The balance sheet of each subsidiary
which has a non-euro functional currency is translated at year-end exchange rates, with the exception
of equity balances which are translated at historic rates. The resulting exchange differences are

##### xxiii


-----

recognized in a separate currency translation reserve within equity and are reported in other
comprehensive income.

As of the end of the reporting period, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into the
functional currency at the exchange rate as of the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign
operations are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates as of the dates of the
transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized in other comprehensive income accumulated
in reserve. At the time of disposal of a foreign operation, any accumulated currency-translation
differences are transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

**Rounding**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or in thousands, have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the
data in this Offering Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such
information. Percentages and amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and
other data set forth in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations” are calculated using the numerical data in the Financial Statements or the tabular_
presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable,
and not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof.

##### EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION

The following table presents, for the periods set forth below, the high, low, average and period end
Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) expressed as U.S. dollars per €1.00. The Bloomberg Composite
Rate (London) is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is equal to the
highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate offered
by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate (London) is a mid-value rate between the applied
highest bid rate and the lowest ask rate. The rates presented herein may differ from the actual rates used
in the preparation of the Financial Statements and the operating and financial information appearing in
this Offering Memorandum. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers represent that
the U.S. dollars amounts referred to below could be or could have been converted into euro at any
particular rate indicated or any other rate. The average rate for a year means the average of the
Bloomberg Composite Rates (London) on the last day of each month during a year. The average rate
for a month, or for any shorter period, means the average of the daily Bloomberg Composite Rates
(London) during that month, or shorter period, as the case may be. The Bloomberg Composite Rate of
the U.S. dollar on July 7, 2021 was $1.1800 per €1.00.

**Overview**

We are a leading parking infrastructure operator and services provider in the European market, with a
large and diversified portfolio of leased and managed parking facilities across 13 European countries.
We operate off-street parking facilities under leases from private and public landlords, and also operate
on- and off-street parking facilities for clients under management contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we
operated approximately 11,700 parking facilities with over 1.6 million parking spaces. We believe we
are either the leading or number two parking facility operator by number of parking spaces in each of
our ten largest country markets.

We benefit from a large, structurally attractive and growing parking market that we believe will benefit
from ongoing outsourcing, mobility and other industry trends such as growth in the number of vehicles
in Europe, urban areas, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, car hiring and sharing and more recently use
of the car parks as infrastructure for the e-commerce value chain and customer delivery. During 2018,
the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues of which
approximately €11 to 12 billion was spent on outsourcing parking management. We believe we are well
positioned to capture the benefits from these trends and the general economic recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic expected in 2021 and 2022 because we create significant, stable and recurring
value for our clients, for whom parking facilities are often a non-core operation, by providing a large
scale platform that is focused on driving higher revenues by increasing volume, pricing and utilization,
at a lower cost of operation.

Our operations benefit from a diverse portfolio of lease and management contracts as well as
geographical, business sector and customer diversification, which made our business more resilient
during the COVID-19 pandemic, while at the same time allowing us to leverage operational similarities
to benefit from scale economies. Our parking facilities are spread across most of Europe (with certain
clusters for operational efficiency) and apart from one large market (Germany), five other countries
(Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway) each contributed approximately 10% of
our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We operate in a wide
range of business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and
hospitality, and parking enforcement, with limited correlation between them. Furthermore, many of our
parking facilities are not dedicated to a single institution, business or purpose but are instead multifunctional and used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether it is for work, shopping,
restaurant or cultural activities, or other purposes. We have very low contract concentration, with over
5,900 contracts across over 11,700 parking facilities.

We have made significant investments in recent years in our information technology and digital delivery
in order to make our facilities and services more attractive to both motorists and landlords. We offer
motorists various services related to on-street and off-street parking via smartphone applications and
end customer-oriented websites. These services cover the entire parking customer experience, from
searching for and reserving a parking space, navigating to the parking garage, contactless entry and exit,
and electronic payment. This saves motorists from having to draw a ticket, walk to the ticket machine
or cash machine and pay with cash, making the parking process easier, faster and more comfortable for
the end customer. These digital services also allow for additional yield management through
differentiated pricing according to the number of available spaces, distribution channel, location and
size of specific parking spaces and customer groups.

We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models, lease contracts and management
contracts. In each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring
significant capital expenditures and thus through an “asset light” approach that is flexible and scalable,
because we operate the facilities as opposed to owning them. Our long-term underlying contract
structures provide us with stability of revenues and the ability to forecast and plan. As of March 31,
2021, our average contract life (including extensions) for our top 100 contracts (based on weighted
average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019) was approximately
31 years with an average remaining life of approximately 12 years.

- _Lease Contracts. We lease parking sites from our clients, where we are responsible for running_
the parking operations and driving site-revenue. We receive parking fees directly from the

##### 2


-----

consumers parking in our leased sites and we pay rent to the lessor, either as a fixed rent, a
variable rent or a combination of fixed and variable rent payments. We focus on driving yield
at the site by increasing parking volume and price. We have a mix of short and long-term
parking customers at our leased sites. Short-term parking includes customers who pay on a perhour or per-day basis. Short-term parking generated 53% of our total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2019. Long-term, or contract parking revenue, includes customers holding
season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets, and individual customers
and business customers who may contract for multiple spaces. Long-term contract parking
generated 11% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Short-term parking
customers provide immediate payment in cash, by debit or credit cards, or through payment
apps at the location of our parking facilities. In addition, in some countries, including Norway
and Sweden, short-term parking customers are charged via invoice after the parking event has
been completed, for which we charge an additional fee payable by the consumer. Contract
parking customers provide advance payments which contribute to revenue stability and a
favorable net working capital profile. We are responsible for providing car parking technology
at the site and all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking equipment during
the term of the lease, with minimal responsibility for the physical upkeep of the facility and as
a result have limited capital expenditure obligations for maintenance of the facility. Our lease
contract business generated 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

- _Management contracts. Our management business represents the fees we receive for managing_
parking facilities under contracts with third parties including public authorities as well as
private landlords and other private entities. Under these contracts we also advise on driving
revenue and traffic to the site. We are responsible for running the parking operations and
providing the car parking technology, which is often purchased through us but paid and owned
by the client. We are incentivized to meet a fixed contractual service level for which we receive
a fixed management fee from our client, and may also receive additional incentive fees. We do
not pay rent to our client, and the clients benefit from the fees paid by customers parking their
cars at these locations (which they receive either directly or through us, but which we typically
do not recognize as revenue). At sites under management contracts, we focus on maximizing
operational efficiency and scale and do not bear the risk of reduced traffic volumes and make
limited to no capital investments. Our management contract business generated 24% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our parking enforcement services (issuing penalty notices on private land and administering fines in
public spaces) help our clients increase parking compliance and safety and reduce abuse, over-stays and
unwanted parking. These services include the patrolling of parking facilities owned or leased by our
clients, the issuance and collection of parking fines, the management of debt collection and the provision
of impartial representation and appeals services. We offer our parking enforcement services mainly in
Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of €157 million, or 21.8% of our total revenue from
parking enforcement services.

We also provide an extended range of ancillary services, including traffic management, taxi
management, shuttle management, valet parking, trolley services, parking space monitoring, security
and cleaning, advertising space marketing, e-solutions such as online booking platforms, apps and
electronic payment methods, collection services to parking facility owners as well as 24/7 support and
advising property owners on commercial and technical asset management as well as, in certain
circumstances, the planning, financing, construction and operation of multi-storey car parks and parking
spaces.

In addition, we have recently introduced “APCOA Urban Hubs,” which expands our core business
through new partnerships with participants across the mobility, logistics, electrification and technology
sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the acceleration of the e-commerce penetration, on-demand
proximity services, proliferation of new mobility models and increased automation. These services

##### 3


-----

require substantial city-based infrastructure. Our APCOA Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with
dedicated parking areas that can be used for alternative services, such as the long-term and short-term
storage of goods, trans-shipping for trucks and electric bikes for last mile deliveries, fleet parking for
logistics companies, shared vehicle and other mobility services and EV charging stations for fleet and
micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. In addition, APCOA Urban Hubs offer fixed
infrastructure such as the installation of 5G antennas, solar panels and wind energy generation. Our
APCOA Urban Hubs typically require low capital expenditures from us as our partners usually bear the
cost of installation of any required infrastructure. We created APCOA Urban Hubs with the aim of
establishing a new business segment for the use of parking spaces by B2B partners initially with an
increasing B2C offering in the medium term. To date, we have opened 179 APCOA Urban Hubs
focusing primarily on Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. As the COVID-19 pandemic has
accelerated the need to find alternative uses for parking spaces, we expect that APCOA Urban Hubs
will be a substantial part of our business going forward, reducing risk by providing further
diversification of our revenue streams. We have recently signed contracts with significant participants
in this evolving market, in addition to pursuing a healthy pipeline of additional Urban Hubs
opportunities.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was €720.6 million, our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted
EBITDA was €83.7 million and our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA was €99.3 million.

**Strengths**

We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Europe, including our
local market leadership positions, long-term contract revenues, resilient and diversified business profile,
advanced digital and technology systems, local density and efficient operations and a strong
management team.

**_Leading Parking Infrastructure Operator in Europe_**

We are one of the leading car park infrastructure operators in the European parking market. We operate
approximately 11,700 parking facilities, and have increased our parking facilities from 1.3 million in
2016 to over 1.6 million parking spaces as of March 31, 2021. We believe we have the leading or second
largest market share by number of parking spaces in each of our ten largest markets. Our leading
position helps provide strong brand value, which has allowed us to achieve above-market growth in
recent years in our key countries. Our well-developed operational capabilities provide us with a highly
scalable platform through which we can add additional facilities and services at a moderate incremental
cost. We have been able to efficiently consolidate other European parking operations by acquiring
smaller operators, including Real Estate Schaffhausen GmbH, Alpina Deutschland GmbH, OnePark
A/S, Security Park AS, Profectum AS, Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, Mobile
Research Solutions Limited and Xpert Parkering Sweden AB. We have a large presence in the top cities
by population in each of our markets, which leads to density-related synergies. Our pan-European
presence allows us to serve our clients across a wide range of European geographies and makes us a
partner of choice for key pan-European property owner and investor corporate accounts. We believe
that our attractive locations, digital offering with direct customer interactions and internal data on
frequencies and customer behavior help us drive favorable pricing.

We are able to use our scale to operate our car park portfolio in an efficient manner, which allows us to
realize synergies and also makes us an attractive partner for our clients. For example, our scale enables
us to share resources among our car parks (in particular, in clusters where we operate multiple parking
facilities in close proximity) including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management
resources in respect of parking customer service, client support, accounting, marketing, human
resources, insurance and tax matters. Due to our size and scale, we are better equipped to make
significant investments in IT and parking lot technology and to leverage such investments across our
operations compared to smaller competitors. Our information technology services cover the entire
parking customer experience from searching for and reserving a parking space through to navigating to
the parking garage, contactless entry and exit and electronic payment. In 2018 we launched our APCOA

##### 4


-----

FLOW platform, which is based on a central, open and scalable digital platform which connects the
vast majority of our leased parking garages, including parking technology, with its customers and their
vehicles via a cloud solution including smartphone apps. We are also in the process of upgrading our
APCOA Flow platform to provide real time data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities,
thereby enabling us to better anticipate and predict customer demand. APCOA FLOW also provides us
with a direct channel to our end customers, allowing us to offer tailor-made products, differentiated
prices and convenience thereby increasing customer loyalty and frequency of use. These operational
efficiencies and incremental revenues generated through information technology initiatives and
investments allow us to offer a compelling product to customers and landlords. APCOA FLOW is also
a key element of our new APCOA Urban Hubs initiative.

**_Large and Structurally Attractive Growing Market_**

During 2018, the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues, with
approximately €11 to 12 billion spent on outsourcing parking management of which over €6 billion was
spent on off-street management in our top six markets. The European parking market grew by 4-5%
annually from 2013 to 2018, primarily as a result of new outsourcing, increased pricing and increased
volume through better utilization and new builds, in particular in larger cities. We expect that
outsourcing will continue to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as clients seek to lower
their costs by partnering with operators like us who can provide economies of scale and provide
alternative uses such as through our APCOA Urban Hubs initiative. The countries in which we operate
have seen steady parking revenue growth and increasing personal car fleet levels over the past decade.
The large and growing car fleet in Europe included over 240 million vehicles in 2019. From 2013 to
2019, the number of passenger car registrations in Europe increased by between 12 and 15 million
vehicles per year. In 2020 this trend was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Summary—
_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The off-street parking industry in Europe is highly fragmented_
with a limited number of large players who have the scale to operate their business as efficiently as we
do.

Our client acquisition strategy is largely focused on first time outsourcing. We believe there is continued
strong outsourcing penetration potential in Europe, as currently approximately 50% of the European
parking market by revenue is run by business or property owners and not otherwise outsourced to
specialized parking operators. In addition, we believe that there will be continued growing demand for
outsourcing in parking due to the increased adoption of technologies, the increased consumer demand
for digital services, the increased level of sophistication required in yield management, increased budget
pressure on municipalities and the necessity to decrease costs through economies of scale.
Approximately 80% of our average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution from new business during 2018,
2019 and 2020 results from first time outsourcing.

We believe that off-street parking is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for
example: the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in
city centers, increasing prices of on-street parking and the introduction of electric cars, which require
EV charging spaces that off-street parking can offer. As a result, based on the market report prepared
by an international management consultant firm, outsourced parking consumer spend is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 4% between 2018 and 2023.

_________________

(1) Total parking market valued at €28-29 billion in 2018.

We also believe that parking facilities will benefit from the ongoing transformation of off-street car
park facilities into multi-modal urban hubs. We have focused on four case-use groups to increase our
revenue derived from urban hubs: mobility modality, new technology and services, logistics and
electrification. Modality improvements provide inter-modal and multi-modal transports from one
location. Ride share providers use parking facilities as hubs to provide these journeys, or rent shared
cars, electric scooters or bikes from these facilities. New technology and services involves integrating
proximity and community services from our locations through our digital platform. In addition, in
October 2020 we demonstrated, together with Bosch/Daimler, automated valet parking for vehicles
with autonomous driving capabilities at Stuttgart airport. Logistics services includes using urban
facilities as fulfillment centers for logistics, storage and distribution services, such as Amazon drop
boxes and overnight delivery package storage. Electrification includes providing connected charging
services for EVs, fleet and micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. We currently provide
consumers access to over 2,000 third-party owned charging stations at our parking facilities, which is
being further expanded.

There are significant barriers to entry for new entrants in the car park industry in Europe, including
required investments in building the required operational know-how and digital infrastructure and the
economies of scale that result from achieving local density. In addition, our long-standing relationships
with our clients enable an ongoing dialogue with them as contracts approach renewal and provide us
with an opportunity to sign pre-emptive renewals usually involving upgrading the parking equipment
in return for a new long-term contract. Our focus on outsourcing, not ownership, allows us to develop
key accounts for whom we operate multiple locations across multiple geographies.

**_Diversified Portfolio with Long-Term Contract Base_**

Our business benefits from a portfolio of parking facilities and parking spaces which is highly
diversified in terms of the geographical distribution, number of contracts, type of contract, number of

##### 6


-----

clients, number of customers and types of customers we serve. Our parking facilities are diversified
across most of Europe and even our largest market (Germany) only represents approximately 33% of
our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, with five other countries (Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the
United Kingdom and Norway) each contributing approximately 10% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract
Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We cover parking facilities for a wide range of
business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and hospitality, and
parking enforcement. Furthermore, many of our parking facilities are typically not dedicated to a single
institution, business or purpose and are multi-functional, in the sense that they are used by motorists
that visit a variety of locations, whether for work, shopping, other cultural activities or other purposes.
We believe our limited reliance on any single geography, customer base or contract helps reduce our
cash flow volatility. Our top ten car parks represented 18% of our total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2019, while our largest car park represented less than 5% of our revenue during the same
period. We are highly selective when evaluating contract opportunities and we only provide such
services to the extent that they comply with our margin and profitability criteria.

We operate parking facilities under long-term leases with a typical initial duration of ten to fifteen years,
with an option to extend for another five to ten years mostly at our sole discretion and management
contracts with a typical duration of three to eight years. Our top 100 existing lease and management
contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December
31, 2019) have an average of approximately 12 years remaining. The average duration for our top 100
contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution) has increased from 23.5 years
in 2016 to 31.1 years in 2021. We have very low contract concentration, with over 5,900 contracts
across over 11,700 parking facilities. We typically have over 96% annual retention. In addition, on
average, contracts representing only 5% of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year
ended December 31, 2019 are up for renewal in each of the next five years. We benefit from significant
revenue visibility in that more than 90% of our revenue typically comes from contracted car parks prior
to the start of any year and such contracted car parks typically provide a stable and predictable revenue
generation. We have a disciplined and proactive contract renewal framework to maximize retention
while safeguarding profitability.

We believe we are well-positioned for a recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to
the structure of our portfolio, which provides long-term revenue visibility. Furthermore, we continued
to invest in new businesses and acquire new contracts during the pandemic, securing new business
contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. As of
May 31, 2021, we valued our unweighted pipeline of new parking contracts at approximately €80
million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. Our current unweighted pipeline of new contracts has
constantly remained high at approximately €75 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution since
January 2020 and over €65 million since the fourth quarter in 2018. We expect this to contribute
significantly to our portfolio, revenue and margin growth going forward once utilization levels recover
to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.

**_Asset-Light Business Model With a Flexible Cost Base and Optimal Return on Capital_**

We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models: lease contracts and management
contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operations under lease contracts generated 76%
of our revenues, and operations under our management contracts generated 24% of our revenues. In
each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring significant capital
expenditures and through an asset light approach that is flexible and scalable, because we operate the
facilities as opposed to owning them. Our asset light model benefits from an attractive payback period
of approximately one year on new business investments, mainly in parking and equipment technology.
Our long-term underlying contract structures provide visibility and stability and we seek to negotiate
for contractual flexibility in the event of material adverse changes on sites that are outside of our control.
For the facilities we operate under leases, we generate our fees based on tariffs charged directly to car
park users, which allows us to apply our yield management expertise to increase volumes and prices.
We have a balanced level of fixed lease costs (42% of fixed rent as a percentage of total rent in the year
ended December 31, 2019 on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) because most of our leases provide for a mix of fixed

##### 7


-----

and variable rent payments, the variable portion of which is based on the actual revenue earned by us
at the location subject to the lease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 58% of our €345 million of
pre-IFRS 16 rent expense was variable rents. In the year ended December 31, 2020, when our business
was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the variable rents provided an immediate expense
buffer with our variable rent expense decreasing by €111 million compared to our original budgeted
variable rent expense for the period. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 46% of our pre-IFRS 16
rent expense was variable. The management fees charged by us under our management contracts
typically increase each year in line with inflation, and often include additional incentive fees depending
on the performance of the facility. Compared to the substantial decrease in our lease contract revenue
due the COVID-19 pandemic, our management contract revenue during the year ended December 31,
2020 only decreased by 10% compared to the previous year, as our clients continued to need our
services and were required to make payments despite lower parking volumes.

**_Strong Financial Profile, with Successful Management Execution resulting in Growth, Profitability_**
**_and High Cash Conversion_**

Our business model provides us with long-term cash flow visibility as a result of our strategic focus on
operating our facilities through long-term contracts, recurring business through seasonal parking
customers, parking playing a central role in the local economy as well as our ability to accurately
estimate our revenue and profitability and analyze trends in working capital and capital expenditure.
Our long-term cash flow visibility is furthered by the favorable and stable regulatory environment in
the markets in which we operate as well as by certain contractual protections for us in our lease and
management contracts.

Between 2015 and 2019, we achieved 20 quarters of consecutive year-on-year profit growth up to the
end of 2019 (measured on the basis of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution). Parking demand in a
particular market is typically correlated to the total size of the car fleet in that market (rather than GDP),
which enhances the stability of our revenues over long periods and helps provide resilience through
periods of economic downturn. Our revenue has benefitted from positive structural trends such as
increasing motor vehicle fleet in our markets, a move from on-street parking to off-street parking and
increasing levels of outsourcing, but it has also benefitted from the successful implementation of
strategic expansions by our management team, focusing on clients who outsource operations or
management of their parking facilities for the first time, and achieving high retention rates of typically
over 95% for the past five years. In addition, between 2015 and 2019, we increased our Pre-IFRS 16
Adjusted EBITDA profit margin from 8.8% to 11.6%, primarily as a result of the implementation of
cost savings and operational efficiency measures and better yield management through, for example,
dynamic pricing that we offer across 69 of our sites, all of which were implemented by our current
management team which joined in 2016 and early 2017. Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 2.3%
between 2016 and 2019, primarily driven by like-for-like growth and the acquisitions of OnePark A/S
and Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, offset by the non-renewal of our contract with
Oslo Airport, which we decided not to pursue aggressively due to low margins. This like-for-like
revenue growth was driven by a combination of tariff increases, length of stay and volume management
across all core countries. In addition, between January 2019 and March 31, 2021, we completed five
bolt-on acquisitions with attractive synergies. We believe our scale, stability and industry experience
facilitates our ability to win new business, with a 75% win rate in 2020 for all contracts bid on.

Our management team has also implemented a differentiated approach to both our key pan-European
and local clients, which has resulted in an increase in the share of new business that is generated from
relationships with key accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of our new
business was generated by key accounts, compared to 11% in 2016. We typically have separate
agreements for each of our facilities with our key accounts, with differing durations and renewal dates.
We believe we have strong relationships with our key accounts and that there is continued growth
potential. As of March 31, 2021, we had over 4,800 clients.

Our parking facilities, once operational, require relatively low levels of capital expenditures. Our
limited maintenance capital expenditures, which averaged less than 1% of revenue in the years ended

##### 8


-----

December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are driven by the capital-light nature of our business. Our cash flow
generation benefits from an advantageous working capital cycle through the collection of upfront
payments (through season tickets) from our long-term parking customers and revenue collection
directly upon exit from a car park for our short-term parking customers. We implemented a net working
capital optimization program in 2017 aimed at extending supplier terms and payment cycles and
improving collection and payment processes. As a result of our low capital expenditure and working
capital requirements, we benefit from a high level of cash conversion and achieved an adjusted cash
conversion ratio of 92.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis. We
consistently increased our adjusted free cash flow (before expansion capital expenditures) from 2016
to 2019 by a CAGR of 30.4%.

Below is a chart showing our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA margins,
adjusted free cash flows and adjusted cash conversion ratios from 2016 to 2020:

We believe our growth prospects are further boosted by our new APCOA Urban Hubs initiatives as
well as new business wins, with €21 million of signed new parking business not yet fully reflected in
our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Clear Strategy Targeting Low-Risk Growth Opportunities from Multiple Sources_**

We believe we are well positioned to continue expanding our business by targeting a diverse range of
low-risk growth opportunities across our traditional parking markets and expanding our new APCOA
Urban Hubs initiative.

We expect that demand for traditional parking across our sectors will continue to normalize as
vaccination programs are now well underway across all of our countries, with more than 50% of the
adult population in each of our top six countries having received at least one dose of the COVID-19
vaccine. Accordingly, we continue to monitor growth opportunities in this sector. In addition, despite
the difficult market environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we further expanded our contract

##### 9


-----

portfolio, winning new business contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS
16 Contract Contribution, which we expect will contribute to our portfolio growth going forward. We
will continue to make technological developments focused on improving service delivery and margins
in our traditional parking sectors, as well as further refine our pricing mechanisms in order to improve
yield. We believe our continued focus on key accounts, with whom we believe we have strong
relationships, and first time outsourcing differentiates us from our competitors and provides continued
growth potential.

We also believe there are growth opportunities in the less traditional parking markets. For example, we
plan to continue our expansion of our parking enforcement services in Scandinavia and roll out ANPRbased services in the rest of Europe for the retail and healthcare sectors in particular.

We also believe we are well positioned to continue growing through our new APCOA Urban Hubs
initiative, which expands our core business through new partnerships with participants across the
mobility, logistics, electrification and technology sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the
acceleration of the e-commerce penetration, on-demand proximity services, proliferation of new
mobility models and increased automation. These services require substantial city-based infrastructure,
which we are ideally placed to provide at a lower cost than our partners could find for many other types
of infrastructure. Our APCOA Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with dedicated parking areas that
can be used for alternative services. Our wide network of parking facilities, proximity to consumers and
digital capabilities provide a strong asset to these partnerships.

**_Experienced Management Team_**

Our executive management and country management teams have significant experience and
understanding of the car park sector and have a combined experience of over 150 years in the industry,
of which the country management team has over 130 years of experience in the industry. Our executive
management team has focused on increasing revenues through creating a much wider contract pipeline
combined with a higher new project win rate, an increased retention rate, consistent like-for-like growth,
cost optimization and selective strategic acquisitions. We have increased our focus on managing
existing contracts efficiently and have implemented a reward-based culture that promotes excellence
among our local management teams. We have adopted a differentiated approach to pan-European and
local key accounts. As a result, from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December
31, 2019, our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 9.5%. Our management team
has also sought to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector and uses for
our facilities, which has enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient pricing, revenue
management, digitalization programs and user-friendly applications.

In addition, our local management teams are well connected to industry bodies and groups as well as
municipalities and maintain strong and long-standing local relationships with the relevant regulatory
authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We benefit from the extensive sector expertise of
our operational managers.

**Strategy**

Our key strategies are as follows:

**_Increase Like-for-Like Sales at our Existing Facilities_**

We plan to continue to seek to increase like-for-like growth at our existing facilities by increasing
volume, effectively managing pricing, creating a differentiated parking experience through digital
parking tools and targeted marketing campaigns. Dynamic pricing has developed as an important
instrument to optimize pricing and yield, and we plan to continue to refine our pricing mechanisms.
Depending on various factors such as day of the week, time of day, occupancy or specific space location
and size, parking tariffs can be dynamically adjusted at car park and specific space level. We plan to

##### 10


-----

continue to seek ways to manage demand at the individual car park level through efficient pricing as
we believe dynamic pricing offers significant revenue enhancement potential.

We plan to continue to implement measures that seek to create a seamless customer experience. We
have invested in ANPR and our APCOA FLOW mobile application, allowing frictionless and ticketless
entry, exit and payment. Besides automatic number plate recognition, customers can access our sites
through radio-frequency identification (“RFID”), Bluetooth or quick response (“QR”) codes. In
addition, we have installed several user-friendly information technology applications to enhance the
customer experience at our car parks, including electronic payment devices. We have installed cashless
and contactless payment mechanisms and have begun using differentiated parking tariffs based on
supply and demand. Over 3 million customers have downloaded our apps to benefit from this increased
convenience. We plan to continue to implement these initiatives at more of our parking facilities and to
continue to develop new ways to make our parking facilities more attractive to customers.

In addition, at many of our facilities we have installed a robust infrastructure of charging facilities for
EVs. The installation and capital expenditure costs are usually covered by our partners, the revenues
from the sale of electricity is shared between us and our partners and we benefit from additional parking
tariffs. In Denmark and Sweden, customers can use our APCOA FLOW app to pay for the electricity
when charging their EVs at one of our facilities or across our partners’ networks, and we are in the
process of implementing this feature in Norway. We believe providing these services will increase
frequency at our sites by offering differentiated and environmentally-friendly services to customers who
own electric and hybrid vehicles, broadening our consumer base.

**_Retain Existing Clients and Grow New Business Pipeline_**

Our retention rates in 2019 and 2020 for our leases and management contracts were approximately 98%,
which shows the stability of our underlying business. We have adopted a differentiated approach to key
pan-European and local clients in order to ensure that we are retaining key accounts. We plan to seek
to continue to retain clients through forward-thinking account management and will continue to
proactively analyze our clients’ infrastructure to ensure we are addressing their needs.

Due to our market leading position, scale, high quality operations, competitive contract pricing and
smart technology offering, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified
portfolio by capturing new contracts in value enhancing locations from both existing clients seeking to
award new contracts and from organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking
facilities, including first time outsourcers. Due to our scale, long-standing industry experience and local
density, we believe we are able to achieve significant synergies that allow us to offer competitive terms
and win new business. Our selection of facility locations is driven by our long-term strategy to operate
and expand in high margin locations and seek local density. Despite the effect of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31,
2021 we signed new contracts which we estimate will contribute an aggregate amount of approximately
€53.6 million to our revenue and approximately €13.2 million to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution
and approximately €14.8 million to our revenue and approximately €3.9 million to our Pre-IFRS 16
Contract Contribution, respectively. On average, the Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution margin of new
business won during 2020 is approximately 500bps above the existing core portfolio of contracts as of
2019. Our current unweighted pipeline of new contracts has constantly remained high at approximately
€75 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution since January 2020 and over €65 million since the
fourth quarter in 2018.

We plan to expand our operations by capturing new opportunities that meet our stringent investment
criteria, including sites that enhance our pricing strategy through a resilient local competitive dynamic,
permit operational cost reductions given our ability to have a single work force servicing multiple
locations and maintain strong relationships with local landlords. In addition, we are often able to expand
our locations to further facilities once we have entered a local market by virtue of our existing
relationships with local landlords and the ability to benefit from synergies with existing parking
facilities. There is also a large opportunity in the transfer of unpaid parking to paid parking, mainly in

##### 11


-----

the retail space as well as in underused office and residential buildings. We will seek to grow
opportunities from first time outsourcing by persuading clients to launch paid parking, effectively
creating new markets.

We believe that we are able to serve a broader market of companies than most traditional operators due
to our focus on operating as opposed to owning the car parks. We believe that our focus on operations
allowed us to establish unique relationships with our large clients as, contrary to certain traditional
operators, we do not compete with our landlords for the purchase of available car park real estate. These
established relationships with private and municipal landlords allow us to be in a better position than
certain of our competitors to secure contracts relating to our landlords’ newly acquired car parks. In
addition, we have introduced a number of initiatives to expand our operations. For example, our
APCOA Urban Hubs initiative extends the use of the parking facilities we operate beyond the core
function of “parking,” providing alternative uses for parking spaces that are unused, such as short term
storage of goods, shared vehicle and other mobility services, EV charging stations and the installation
of 5G antennas. We plan to continue to seek to transform additional parking areas into urban hubs and
expect that APCOA Urban Hubs will be a substantial part of our business going forward.

We believe our position as one of the leading operators of parking facilities in Europe, combined with
our long-standing relationships with a diverse group of landlords and local authorities and favorable
industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, as well as our new initiatives, will provide us with
a number of opportunities to grow our contract base and pipeline of new opportunities.

**_Continue to Seek Accretive Acquisition Opportunities_**

We plan to continue to selectively identify and target acquisition opportunities in order to increase our
scale. We believe there is still a high level of fragmentation in the European market for parking space
management. The majority of providers are local operators with fewer than 20 car parks. As a result,
we believe we have potential for growth through further consolidation. In 2020 we acquired Security
Park Group in Norway and Xpert Parkering in Sweden, with both businesses delivering a positive
EBITDA in 2020. We plan to continue to seek EBITDA enhancing, value accretive, highly synergistic
acquisitions.

**_Enhance Mobility Solutions and Partnerships_**

We are currently expanding our core business under the brand “APCOA Urban Hubs.” Through this
program, we seek to open up our physical and digital parking infrastructure to partners who are seeking
and are in need of city based infrastructure to support their operations or to deliver consumer based
services. Specifically, partners seek to use our parking areas for logistics, vehicle and other mobility,
electrification and new technology services. Examples include locker boards, logistics fleet parking and
EV charging stations, long-term storage and the installation of 5G antennas. What these services all
offer in common is that, by linking the physical infrastructure with the digital infrastructure, an
alternative use of the parking areas is enabled that extends beyond the core function of “parking.” We
believe that as a result of the trends of urbanization, new mobility and increasing e-commerce, our panEuropean network, comprising more than 11,700 parking facilities, offers great development potential
for our company and its partners. We will continue to seek to transform additional parking areas into
urban hubs.

**Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted our results. Beginning in February (in Italy and at
airports) and March (in our other markets) 2020, car park usage in Europe reduced drastically as a result
of the restrictions on movement and other social distancing measures imposed by governments in
Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Car park usage at our facilities was similarly affected
in this period. We recorded a decrease in sales revenues of €188.7 million, or 26.2% (€180.1 million
decrease, or 25.4%, on a constant currency basis), from €720.6 million for the year ended December
31, 2019 to €531.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, due to reductions in vehicle parking

following the lockdowns resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Analysis of Operating Results—_ _Year_
_ended December 31, 2019 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020” for more information._

While our Contract Contribution from management contracts and revenues from long-term parking
remained fairly stable throughout the year, our short-term parking revenues in our lease sites were
strongly impacted by the stringent government lockdown measures to contain the virus. For a number
of weeks early in 2020 our short-term parking revenues from leased sites came to a virtual standstill as
people worked from home and were only allowed or advised to go out for essential or permitted
purposes. The effect of these measures was most severe in the period March to May 2020. Following
the easing of restrictions during the second quarter of the year, customers immediately started to return
to our facilities resulting in a strong recovery of our short term parking revenues and cash flow. This
recovery continued over summer 2020. Although we were still impacted by the absence of public events
(cinemas, theatres and large-scale gatherings), working from home policies and continued restrictions
on travel, short-term parking revenues in the third quarter of 2020 reached on average 80% of levels in
the comparable period in 2019. Increasing infections and hospitalizations led to the reinstatement of
government restrictions from October 2020 onwards, with all our geographic markets experiencing
various degrees of lockdowns, which in turn caused short term parking revenues to decline again. In the
three months ended March 31, 2021, our operations continued to be impacted due to the movement
restrictions imposed by governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a
reduction in frequencies and volumes at the sites we operate, and consequently in revenues, compared
to the prior period.

We took measures at an early stage to limit the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our
employees, operations and business development. Specifically, home office regulations for office staff
were introduced in order to protect customers and employees, operational personnel were switched to
multi-shift operation, and hygiene measures in offices and parking garages were intensified. We sought
to keep our parking facilities open as much as possible as people were advised to avoid public transport
and we took measures to decrease physical contact points by enabling and promoting digital payment
and contactless and cashless parking and payment solutions.

Our management reacted quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic and established a cross-functional
COVID-19 response team, which focuses on safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and
consumers and limiting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In particular in March
2020, management implemented strict cash management controls, including (i) a bottom-up, 17-week
rolling cashflow forecast and (ii) the deferral of non-essential overhead expenses and capital
expenditures, which resulted in a reduction of our non-new business capital expenditures to €17.7
million (compared to €22.6 million in the year ended December 2019). These cash management controls
resulted in reductions in total capital expenditures (excluding finance leases) in 2020 compared to the
original budget for that year of €10.3 million, of which €9.9 million was deferred to 2021. In addition,
we implemented stringent operational and overhead cost reduction measures, including an immediate
freeze of all temporary and new hiring, a reduction in headcount of 736 employees, particularly in our
parking attendant and airport staff numbers, and furloughing approximately 22% of our non-directly
revenue generating operational and overhead staff. Furthermore, we leveraged government programs,
such as flexi-time and furlough arrangements and fixed cost recovery support schemes, in order to
further reduce our cost base. These measures resulted in cost reductions compared to the original 2020
budget of approximately €44 million, or 17% of our total non-rent costs, in the year ended December
31, 2020.

In March 2020, we initiated a rent waiver and deferral program across our entire business, which
included the re-negotiation of lease contracts with the aim to defer rent payments and temporarily reduce
or move fixed rent structures to variable rent structures. In addition, we invoked existing contractual
protection clauses, such as clauses allowing rent adjustments in the case of an under-utilization of
parking facilities, to further reduce our rent payments. These rent reduction measures, coupled with the
benefit of reduced variable rent costs due to lower revenues, resulted in rent savings of approximately
€125 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the original budget for that year.

##### 13


-----

In May and June 2020, we also raised additional liquidity in an aggregate amount net of costs of €68
million in the form of an additional term loan facility. Furthermore, in May 2020, our ultimate
shareholders, Centerbridge and SVP Global, provided us with an equity injection in the amount of €40
million.

_________________

(1) Liquidity includes unrestricted cash on balance sheet and €34 million available for drawing under our Existing Revolving Credit
Facility.

Despite the difficult market environment, we further expanded our contract portfolio, winning new
business contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution,
which we expect will contribute to our portfolio growth going forward. We maintained our historically
high and stable retention rate of typically over 95% in the past five years, signaling the stability of the
underlying business during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the contract profit pool currently remains
underutilized due to COVID-19 related restrictions, the fundamentals of the business are intact and
APCOA’s portfolio is expected to rebound once lock-downs and restrictions on mobility are lifted. As
a result of the pandemic, we accelerated our initiatives to increase our digital presence and provide tools
to offer our customers more flexible, seamless and/or contactless parking solutions. We also
successfully concluded the acquisition of the Security Park Group in December 2020. As a
consequence, we have continued to invest in new business for the future.

Despite our business having been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the past fifteen
months also showed that as soon as restrictions are eased, people quickly start to return to our facilities,
corresponding to a direct recovery in revenues. While the COVID-19 crisis is not over, the spread of
the virus continues and certain government restrictions remain, vaccination programs are now well
underway across all of our countries, with more than 50% of the adult population in each of our top six
countries having received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, starting from April
2021 and more visibly from mid- May 2021, we have seen signs of recovery across most of our markets
as countries witnessed an easing of mobility restrictions that had been put in place in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, including the opening of shopping areas, restaurants and outside events.
Frequencies and movements across all our sectors have been increasing steadily since then. For
example, in our German business, the City and Shopping sectors reached more than 85% of their 2019
levels and the Healthcare & Education sector reached 75% of its 2019 levels, followed by Hospitality
(approximately 60% of 2019 levels), Airports (approximately 30% of 2019 levels) and Events

##### 14


-----

(approximately 40% of 2019 levels). These trends are further visible in traffic data from major cities,
which shows that traffic is approaching or, in certain cases passing, 2019 levels as mobility continues
to trend towards more normalized levels. As the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues
across all of our markets, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of new opportunities in
the European parking market once the lockdown restrictions are eased again.

The chart below illustrates the movements in the frequency of visitors to the APCOA car parks in
Germany on a weekly basis from January 2020 compared to 2019 and demonstrates the strong
improvements seen since the middle of May 2021.

**Recent Developments**

Based on unaudited management accounts for the three months ended June 30, 2021, our sales revenue
was €137.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to €98.2 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2020. In addition, we estimate that our like-for-like revenue, defined as revenue
from sites which are neither new, lost or renewed during a specific period, grew at a rate of 29% for the
three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. Our Pre-IFRS
16 Adjusted EBITDA was €(0.2) million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to €(13.9)
million for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

Our sales revenue was €39.2 million in the month ended April 30, 2021 (69% of our sales revenue for
the month ended April 30, 2019), €45.4 million in the month ended May 31, 2021 (75% of our sales
revenue for the month ended May 31, 2019) and €52.9 million in the month ended June 30, 2021 (91%
of our sales revenue for the month ended June 30, 2019). This shows a continued positive trend in the
recovery of our top line, as certain of the important COVID-19 restrictions in our markets were lifted
during the second half of May, in addition to the benefits of the new business won and acquisitions

completed in the last two years. The months of May and June also displayed the first two months of
positive Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA of 2021. Our Pre-IFRS Adjusted EBITDA was €(3.8) million
in the month ended April 30, 2021, €0.3 million in the month ended May 31, 2021 and €3.2 million in
the month ended June 30, 2021. Our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for June 2021 includes a €0.9
million benefit from rent waivers finalized with clients during the month, relating to the wider prior
period our sites were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

##### SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE

The following diagram presents our simplified corporate and financing structure as adjusted for the
Transactions. For more information, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and
“Description of the Notes.”

_________________

(1) As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Sponsor indirectly controls (through intermediate holding companies) 83.0% of
the Issuer’s share capital. Other indirect shareholders of the Issuer include SVP Global (16.3%) and certain minority shareholders
(0.7%). See “Our Principal Shareholders.”

(2) Park LuxCo 2 S.à r.l owns 87.5% of the shares in the Parent. Park Investment GP S.à r.l. indirectly owns the remaining 12.5% in
the Parent through its ownership of the shares in Park Investment S.C.Sp. Certain members of management also hold shares in
Park Investment S.C.Sp. See “Management—Management Investment Plan.”

(3) The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other than investments in its
subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations under
the Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility.

(4) The Issuer is offering €665.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Notes, consisting of €      million Floating Rate Notes
and €      million Fixed Rate Notes. On the Issue Date, the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by a first-priority
security interest in the Collateral. The Collateral will also secure the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations,
certain cash management obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture on a first-priority basis.
Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, liabilities in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging
obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture that are
secured by the Collateral will be repaid with the proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or the enforcement of, the Collateral in
priority to the Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

(5) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which will provide for a
€80 million New Revolving Credit Facility, of which €30.5 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which
bank guarantees may be issued, €17 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which cash loans may be
drawn, and €32.5 million will be available for utilization in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The New
Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date, except for €20.1 million of non-cash guarantees currently
issued under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and Existing Guarantee Facility which will remain outstanding pursuant to the
ancillary facilities described in the preceding sentence. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—New Revolving
_Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

by the Guarantors. Each Note Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the Agreed Security
Principles, and certain contractual and legal limitations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and Security Interests” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be_
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its
Guarantee.

(7) The Issuer’s subsidiaries that are Guarantors held 56% of the total unconsolidated assets of the Group (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis) as
of December 31, 2019, and generated 83% of the total unconsolidated net sales revenues and 81% of the total unconsolidated PreIFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2019, in each case, before intercompany eliminations.

(8) Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will not guarantee the Notes. As of March 31, 2021, the subsidiaries of the Issuer that will not
guarantee the Notes had €1.5 million of outstanding third-party debt. Any future third-party debt of the subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes will rank structurally senior to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees.

withhold or deduct taxes imposed by any relevant
taxing jurisdiction in connection with a payment
with respect to the Notes or the Note Guarantees,
such relevant Issuer or Guarantor will, subject to
certain exceptions, pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received by each
holder of Notes after the withholding or

beneficial owner would have received in the
absence of the withholding or deduction. See
“Description of the Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes
or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, validly
tender and do not validly withdraw such Fixed
Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as applicable,
in such tender offer or offer to purchase, the
Issuer will have the right to redeem all of the
Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, that remain outstanding at a price
equivalent to the price offered to each holder of
the Fixed Rate Notes or Floating Rate Notes, as
applicable, in such tender offer or offer to
purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any,

exceeded in connection with such an event. See
“Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

**Certain Covenants ...........................................** The Issuer will issue the Notes under an
indenture to be dated on or about the Issue Date

things, will restrict the ability of the Issuer and
each restricted subsidiary to:

##### 25


-----

                      - incur or guarantee additional
indebtedness and issue certain preferred
stock;

                      - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and
make certain other restricted payments;

                      - make certain investments;

                      - create, incur or permit to exist certain
liens;

                      - impose restrictions on the ability of the
restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                      - transfer, lease or sell certain assets;

                      - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                      - enter into certain transactions with
affiliates; and

exceptions and qualifications. See “Description
_of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”_

**Original Issue Discount ...................................** The Notes may be issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes if the stated principal amount of the
Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount
greater than or equal to a statutorily defined de
_minimis amount. If so, in addition to the stated_
interest on the Notes, a holder subject to U.S.
federal income taxation would be required to
include amounts representing OID in gross
income on a constant yield to maturity basis as
such OID accrues in advance of the receipt of
cash payments attributable to such income
regardless of such holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original_
_Issue Discount.”_

“Authority”) for the listing of and permission to
deal in the Notes on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”).

to the provisions of Directive 2014/65/EU on
markets in financial instruments, as amended.

been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and are subject to restrictions on
transferability and resale. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

**Absence of a Public Market for the Notes .....** The Notes will be new securities and currently
there is no established trading market for the
Notes. The Initial Purchasers have advised the
Issuer that it may make a market for the Notes,
but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial
Purchasers may discontinue any market-making
in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion
and without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you as to the development or liquidity of

##### SUMMARY FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA

_The following tables present a summary of our historical financial information and have been derived_
_from, and should be read in conjunction with, our Financial Statements that have been prepared in_
_accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere herein and the sections entitled “Presentation of_
_Financial and Other Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition_
_and Results of Operations, “Use of Proceeds” and “Capitalization.”_

_We have extracted (i) the consolidated historical financial information of the Issuer as of and for the_
_financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 from the Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements and (ii) the consolidated historical financial information of the Issuer as of and for the three_
_months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim_
_Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

_The financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 presented below was derived by_
_adding the Issuer’s financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 to its financial_
_information for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and subtracting its financial information for_
_the three months ended March 31, 2020. The financial information for the twelve months ended March_
_31, 2021 is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS, has been prepared for illustrative_
_purposes only and is not necessarily representative of our results of operations or our financial_
_condition for any full year period or at any future date or period. See “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information—Financial Information Presented for the Twelve Months ended March 31, 2021.”_

_In the 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, we have revised the 2019 financial information_
_in the comparative column to reflect a reclassification of rental payments for airports in Norway, which_
_had been previously classified as quasi-fixed under IFRS 16.B42(a)(ii). Accordingly, the historical_
_financial information of the Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 presented below_
_has been extracted from the comparative column in our 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial_
_Statements and differs from the historical financial information as of and for the year ended December_
_31, 2019 presented in our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Presentation of_
_Financial Information—_ _Adjustment of 2019 financial information” and note 9 to our Audited_
_Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2020._

_The following tables also present certain unaudited historical and as adjusted financial information._
_The unaudited as adjusted financial data presented herein does not purport to project our results as of_
_any future date or for any future period. The adjustments to the Issuer’s historical financial information_
_as well as the unaudited as adjusted financial data set forth in this Offering Memorandum are based_
_on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable and_
_may differ materially from the actual adjusted amounts. These as adjusted measures are not financial_
_measures defined in accordance with IFRS and, as such, may not be comparable to similarly titled_
_measures used by other companies._

_The following summary consolidated financial and other financial information includes certain non-_
_GAAP measures that we use to evaluate our economic and financial performance. These measures are_
_not identified as accounting measures under IFRS and therefore should not be considered a substitute_
_for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those_
_calculated using financial measures that are prepared in accordance with IFRS. See “Presentation of_
_Financial Information—Non-GAAP Measures.”_

_We have adopted IFRS 16 from January 1, 2019, which has an impact on our reported consolidated_
_assets, liabilities, income statement data and cash flow statement data. In implementing IFRS 16, our_
_Financial Statements have been prepared under the modified retrospective approach pursuant to which_
_comparative results have not been restated. Accordingly, the comparative information in our Audited_
_Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 (for which period IFRS 16 was not_
_applicable) is not comparable to our financial information for periods beginning on or after January_

_1, 2019. We have presented for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the three months ended_
_March 31, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021 certain financial information_
_on the basis of IFRS applicable until December 31, 2018 (“Pre-IFRS 16 basis”), which has been_
_adjusted to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 and have included such financial information in the tables_

(1) Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for the impact of IFRS 16 and certain other effects that we consider
extraordinary, exceptional or unusual in nature. Our EBITDA Measures, including EBITDA, EBITDA excluding the effects from
the application of IFRS 16 and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, are non-GAAP measures which we consider useful supplemental
information in order to evaluate our performance. We believe that these EBITDA Measures provide investors with a useful tool

description of the limitations of EBITDA, EBITDA excluding the effects from the application of IFRS 16 and Pre-IFRS 16
Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tools, see “Presentation of Financial Information—Non-GAAP Measures.” You should not
consider our EBITDA Measures as substitutes to measures reported in accordance with IFRS, including (a) profit or operating
profit as measures of our operating performance, (b) net cash generated from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or
(c) any other measure of performance or liquidity under IFRS. Our EBITDA Measures are not necessarily comparable to other
similarly titled performance and liquidity measures of other companies, and you should exercise caution in comparing them.

(b) Represents the elimination of effects of the application of IFRS 16 to present our EBITDA as based on the previous lease
accounting standard IAS 17, which was in effect until December 31, 2018, by (i) including the fixed lease payments made
during the years ended December 31, 2019 (€151 million) and 2020 (€158 million), and the three months ended March 31,
2020 (€38 million) and 2021 (€39 million), according to APCOA’s accounting policy, (ii) excluding the lease payments for
leases that are classified as finance leases under IAS 17 and (iii) excluding the utilization of provisions for loss making lease
contracts based on IAS 17 (which are accounted for as impairment charges under IFRS 16).

(c) Includes one-off costs in preparation for a potential sale of our group by the Sponsor. These costs include third party services
in respect of the preparation of exit materials and other preparation measures.

(d) Includes external advisor costs in respect of certain completed and aborted acquisitions as well as costs incurred in
connection with realizing certain integration synergies.

(e) Reflects costs incurred in connection with several restructuring programs aimed at reducing costs, changing certain members
of management and optimizing our organizational structure. In 2018, these restructuring costs included severance costs at
our corporate center and non-recurring costs related to our restructuring program in Germany, which mainly sought to
simplify our management structure. In 2020, restructuring costs were mainly related to the implementation of a Group-wide
restructuring program which was primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We released
€1.0 million of this provision in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

(f) Represents the compensation paid to the four non-shareholder board members of, and costs related to, our advisory board
that are incurred by our shareholders in relation to their activities for the Group.

(g) Reflects costs that we have determined are one-off related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including consulting costs incurred
in connection with preparing our rolling cash-flow forecast and the implementation of other cost saving and COVID-19
mitigation measures, transitioning our office-based workforce to working from home and installing COVID-19 safety and
protection measures at our offices.

(h) Represents an increase to the provision for expected future losses on contracts which are not expected to generate profits in
the foreseeable period during their remaining contract term, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Approximately €5.8 million of these provisions relate to increases of existing impaired contracts and approximately €5.7
million of these provisions relate to contracts that were previously unimpaired. We expect to unwind the provision over the
next few years.

(i) Reflects third party consulting fees in connection with a strategic review of our business.

(1) _Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA represents Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted per the table below. Pro_
_Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure, which we consider to be useful supplemental information in order_
to evaluate our performance. We believe that Pro Forma pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with a useful tool for
assessing our performance as they permit investors to evaluate our profitability from underlying operating activities. For a
description of the limitations of Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as analytical tool, see “Presentation of Financial
_Information—Non-GAAP Measures.” In preparing the adjustments included in our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA,_
our management has made certain assumptions regarding future volumes, pricing and other factors relating to new contracts, the
future performance of new businesses acquired by us as well as the future impact of actions that either have or have not yet been
implemented. We may not realize the volumes, pricing and other factors, either in the amount or within the timeframe we currently
anticipate, and the costs of achieving them may be higher than expected. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our
_Business—Certain adjusted, underlying and pro forma consolidated financial information included in this Offering Memorandum_

_______________

(a) Reflects the estimated net future contribution to our results of new contracts signed prior to December 31, 2019 that were
due to commence operations prior to December 31, 2020 as if such new contracts had been fully operational on January 1,
2019 based on our estimated performance of these new contracts during twelve months once they have become fully
operational, after deducting the profit contribution of contracts for which we had received notice of expiry by December 31,
2019 as if such contracts had expired on January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we estimated that new contracts signed
prior to such date and due to commence operations by December 31, 2020 would have contributed an additional €12.2
million to our results during the first twelve months from becoming fully operational, as if each of these contracts had been
fully operational on January 1, 2019. We have made various assumptions relating to volumes, pricing and other factors,
which management believes to be reasonable. We may not realize the volumes, pricing and other factors, either in the amount
or within the timeframe we currently anticipate, and the costs of achieving them may be higher than expected. In addition,
we excluded the anticipated profitability of the new Berlin airport. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our
_Business—Certain adjusted, underlying and pro forma consolidated financial information included in this Offering_
_Memorandum is presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual results of operations may differ.” In the year ended_
December 31, 2019, contracts that had expired on or prior to December 31, 2019 and contracts that were due to expire by
December 31, 2020 and for which we had received notice of expiration by December 31, 2019 contributed an aggregate €6.2
million to our results.

(b) Reflects the estimated full-year contribution to our results by OnePark in Denmark, NCPS in Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland, Xpert Parkering in Sweden and the Security Park Group in Norway, which we acquired in May 2019,
August 2019, January 2020 and December 2020, respectively, as if we had acquired all these businesses on January 1, 2019,
based on their expected results in the first twelve months of ownership by us, including, in each case, the estimated impact
of new business contracts signed by such entities prior to completion of each acquisition as well as the estimated synergies
expected to be realized in the course of integrating such companies into our operations. We have made various assumptions
relating to the performance of OnePark, NCPS, Xpert Parkering and Security Park during their full first twelve months of
ownership by us as well as certain synergies that we expect to realize from these acquisitions. Our assumptions relating to
the performance of new acquisitions may turn out to be incorrect and we may not realize any of the anticipated synergies in
the anticipated timeframe or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Market and Our Business—Certain adjusted,
_underlying and pro forma consolidated financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is presented for_
_illustrative purposes only and our actual results of operations may differ.”_

(c) Reflects the full-year effect of certain efficiency and operational excellence initiatives that we implemented during the year
ended December 31, 2019 as if such initiatives had been fully operational on January 1, 2019. These initiatives include the
benefits derived from the route planning optimization for our control fee operatives in Germany and Denmark, improved
terms with our debt providers in Germany, Norway and Austria and centralization of cash handling services in Germany.

##### RISK FACTORS

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following_
_risks, together with other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding_
_whether to invest in the Notes. The occurrence of any of the events discussed below could materially_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. If these events occur, the_
_trading prices of the Notes could decline, and we may not be able to pay all or part of the interest or_
_principal on the Notes, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks not currently_
_known to us or that we now deem immaterial could also adversely affect our business, results of_
_operations, or financial condition or our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Notes and affect_
_your investment. Further, to the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and_
_results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this_
_section._

_This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking” statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-_
_looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those discussed below and_
_elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 have disrupted our operations, which have had and may_**
**_continue to have a material negative adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial_**
**_condition and prospects._**

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on the global economy due to the
implementation of a wide variety of control measures including states of emergency, “shelter in place”
orders, border closures, closures of businesses, and restrictions on commuting, local and international
travel, shopping, social and recreational activities and gatherings. The COVID-19 pandemic has
significantly impacted our results. The volume of traffic at our car parks is dependent on mobility, and
in particular people travelling to locations such as places of employment, shopping centers, leisure
facilities, hospitals, airports, offices and urban areas. Beginning in February at our facilities in Italy and
across Europe at certain airports and at all our other facilities in March, our car park usage reduced
drastically as a result of the restrictions on movement and other social distancing measures imposed by
governments in Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For a number of weeks early in 2020
our short-term parking revenues came to a virtual standstill because people worked from home, were
only allowed or advised to go out for essential or permitted purposes and most places that people tend
to drive to were no longer accessible. The effect of these measures on the volume of traffic at our
facilities was most severe in the period March to May 2020. Following the easing of restrictions during
the second quarter of the year, customers immediately started to return to our facilities; however at most
we only reached on average 80% of levels of volume of customers at our facilities in the comparable
period in 2019. Travel in the countries in which we operate, however, in the second quarter of 2020
remained significantly below the levels in the comparable period in 2019. Increasing infections and
hospitalizations led to the reinstatement of government restrictions from October 2020 onwards. All the
countries in which we operate experienced various degrees of lockdowns which have continued in many
of the countries in which we operate through the first and second quarters of 2021, which have
significantly negatively impacted our revenues.

The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects to a number of risks. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively impacted, and
could continue to negatively impact, our revenues and profitability. The impact of the COVID-19
pandemic made it difficult for us to satisfy liquidity requirements during 2020 due to a sharp decline in
our car park usage and could continue to make it difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations or obtain
financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could generally impact our costs and our ability to increase
revenue in the future. As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced or postponed
investments and expenses, introduced short-time working and reduced or deferred lease and rental


-----

payments in agreement with landlords and partners. We took out government-guaranteed loans in
Switzerland and benefited from one-off governmental subsidies from various government capital
infusion programs designed to alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses in the
jurisdictions where we operate. We required an amendment to our credit facility in order to prevent a
default and raised capital from our shareholders and third-party lenders.

Despite the steps we have taken to assess and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, results of operations,
financial condition or prospects is uncertain. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows
from operating activities, and financing is not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our
Revolving Credit Facility or other sources, we may not be able to cover our expenses, grow our
business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, all of which
would harm our business. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and
financial performance, including our ability to execute our near-term and long-term business strategies
and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration
and severity of the pandemic, the rollout of vaccines, continued governmental restrictions and new
strains or variants of the disease against which existing vaccines might be ineffective as well as the
extent of the recovery of business and economic conditions in general, all of which are uncertain and
cannot be predicted. We estimate that a partial recovery of the economy may present substantial risks
to our business and operations, as in that scenario occupancy levels at our facilities are likely to remain
below pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, which would negatively impact our profitability, while our
ability to benefit from governmental assistance would be substantially reduced due to the likelihood of
termination of COVID-19 related financial support programs and furlough schemes. In addition, in that
scenario our landlords may be more reluctant to provide any relief on our lease payments. The potential
effects and long-term impact of COVID-19 could intensify or otherwise affect many of the other risks
set forth herein or present other unforeseen consequences for our business.

**_Changes in individual behavior, including in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to_**
**_a decline in parking demand, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

New customer behavior, such as an increase in online shopping and working from home, or changes in
the popularity of certain stores or locations, including as a result of permanent store, restaurant or
entertainment venue closures, poses a risk of a decreased demand for parking facilities and may have
an adverse effect on our business and revenue. Changes in customer behavior accelerated during the
COVID-19 pandemic and may continue to do so in the aftermath of the pandemic as the majority of the
population in the markets where we operate has progressively adapted to the restrictive measures
implemented in 2020 and 2021 and has increasingly relied on alternative solutions for leisure and
professional needs. Complete and partial closure of shopping centers, leisure amenities and offices and
the rapid growth of online retail, grocery shopping and food delivery services during the COVID-19
shutdown have resulted in a drastic reduction of visits to city centers. The COVID-19 lockdowns may
have changed shopping behavior for the long-term, and customers may purchase more products online
in the future. For instance, in Germany, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, trade fairs
have been organized in a different set-up with fewer visitors and a substantial number of main street
venues have gone out of business. Significantly decreased national and international travel, reduction
in the number of flights and the closure of airports has led to the rapid development of remote working
and virtual meetings solutions. Business travel is one of our most profitable business segments, and it
might never fully recover because of the continued use of virtual meetings. Reduced travel will also
impact hotel parking volume and may result in a decrease in parking at large events, such as sporting
events and concerts. These changes in customer behavior and the emergence of alternative solutions for
leisure and professional needs may be permanent or remain for the long-term, which may result in part
of the parking volumes not recovering to the pre-COVID-19 levels in the long-term in each of the
sectors in which we operate, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business.

Reliance by customers on online services and progressive shifts by employers to flexible working
solutions may continue in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and may result in a decline in

##### 38

parking demand in cities and urban areas as well as transportation hubs such as train stations and
airports, which could have a negative impact on our business. In the twelve months ended December
31, 2019, 11.4% of our revenue was generated by contract parking, where customers have monthly or
annual passes at our facilities. This has generally been a valuable, recurring portion of our revenues. If
many of these customers choose to work from home full-time or even part-time, they may not park in
our facilities any longer, or may not buy monthly or annual passes. Moreover, a slight decrease in the
average parking time that may result from new customer behavior coupled with a lower occupancy rate
of our car parks could have substantial negative impact on our revenue. We have generally relied upon
the historical trends towards urbanization in developing our value-creation initiatives. However, many
people are leaving cities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and are choosing to live in rural areas
and work remotely. A material decline in the number of people living in urban areas could have a
material impact on the volume of cars using our facilities. In addition, changing customer habits as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic that are long-lasting, for example less frequent or shorter shopping
times, utilization of different modes of transportation and reduced in-person gatherings, may have a
materially detrimental effect on our business.

**_General business and economic conditions, including those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in_**
**_the markets where we operate may decrease demand for parking and may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our business, financial condition and results of operations are affected by general business and
economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, in particular in Germany and our other larger
markets. In particular, the long-term economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown at this
time. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in high unemployment rates, reduced customer
spending, increased bankruptcy filings, increased interest rates, high inflation, fluctuations in the
availability or cost of funding, fluctuations in the value of currency or a decline in the strength of
national and local economies in which we operate and other factors that may negatively affect our end
customers’ financial prospects could affect the mobility rates of our end customers. The number of
people visiting shopping centers, restaurants, offices and city centers generally declines during periods
of increased inflation and economic downturn. As a result, a decline in economic conditions could lead
to a decline in the volume of cars parked at our facilities.

**_A large portion of our operations are carried out, and revenue is generated in Europe and Germany,_**
**_in particular. Any adverse political or economic changes within these markets may have an adverse_**
**_effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition._**

All of our business operations are located in Europe. Our business in Germany accounted for
approximately 33% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the financial year ended December
31, 2019. In light of this concentration, our business is sensitive to political or economic developments
that effect Europe and Germany in particular. Concerns regarding the debt burden of certain European
countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the
suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in
individual member states of the EU could have an outsized adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Customer driven changes in transportation habits may result in a reduction in cars parked at our_**
**_facilities._**

Changes in the transportation industry could have a negative impact on our business, such as increased
use of public transport by end customers and car sharing. The increased use of ride sharing services and
alternative public or private transport providers, and the development of autonomous vehicles, are two
trends that are particularly pronounced in larger cities. Such trends may lead to a decline in parking
demand in cities and urban areas as well as in transportation hubs, such as train stations and airports.
The increase in the accessibility of transportation hubs by alternative public or private transport
providers such as trains, shuttles and ride sharing services may lead to a decreased need for car parks.
Car share programs reduce the need for parking spots as multiple motorists can share a single vehicle.

##### 39


-----

Further development of pedestrian or bike pathways and general green initiatives like congestion
charges which are meant to reduce automobile traffic in urban areas could reduce customers at our car
parks. While we devote considerable effort and resources to analyzing and responding to customer
preferences and changes to customer preferences in the markets in which we operate, customer
preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and can change rapidly. We have invested in positioning
ourselves to benefit from trends such as experience shopping and urbanization, but these trends may
turn out to be less resilient than expected or even may reverse.

**_Significant competition in our markets may adversely affect customers’ desire to park at our_**
**_facilities._**

The parking industry is highly competitive. We believe that customer choice regarding parking is driven
partly by price but also by factors such as location, lighting and security and the ease of parking in
particular as a result of payment apps. Some of our competitors may have greater financial, marketing
and other resources available than us. For example, some of our key competitors include Empark and
Q-Park, each of which has substantial financial, marketing and other resources and established brand
names. Our competitors could use their significant resources to increase their marketing, develop new
services or technology or reduce their prices in a manner that adversely impacts our ability to charge
prices that generate the same margins we have earned in the past, or at all. We cannot assure you that
we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Furthermore,
new technology and processes could negatively impact our existing business. For example, continued
use of digital technology to operate parking facilities might diminish the need for physical controls by
our parking officers and therefore the need for certain of our services. In addition, we currently generate
a significant percentage of our revenue from consumers who fail to pay their invoices on time or at all
(i.e., through late fees and related administration fees), which may decrease as more advance parking
technology becomes available. Furthermore, increased use of technology could also lead to new
competitors providing parking services, pushing us towards the role of a facility manager with reduced
spread in the business, which could make our large number of parking facility locations less valuable,
reduce our bargaining powers with our clients and reducing our margins. We also compete with certain
property owners and businesses that operate their own parking facilities. Such entities may be able to
charge lower prices than us because they are seeking to generate revenue through products sold in their
stores, as opposed to parking revenue.

**_Changes in environmental and traffic control regulations could reduce demand for, and volumes in,_**
**_our off-street parking facilities that could adversely affect our business, results of operations or_**
**_financial conditions._**

National or local governments could implement measures which are potentially unfavorable to the
parking sector as a result of pressure from public opinion, advocacy groups, or election results. For
example, proposals relating to limiting traffic within city boundaries or the introduction of bans on
driving of diesel vehicles in certain cities could adversely affect inner-city parking, resulting in lower
revenue and diminished profitability. As an example, a number of car parking spaces in Copenhagen
are expected to be converted to flexible parking spaces for both bicycles and cars. The local authority
in Copenhagen also introduced the “Cyclist Priority Plan for 2017-2025,” which seeks to encourage
50% of commuting journeys to be completed by bicycle. In addition, certain of the cities in which we
operate have introduced dedicated bike lanes in response to changes in traffic patterns and to tackle
environmental concerns. Such initiatives are likely to continue in the future. Governments will likely
continue to implement further measures aimed at reducing car traffic and availability of parking spaces,
additional regulation to provide free parking for staff, patients and visitors at hospitals and other public
places, and regulation with respect to the amount of permitted fines and surcharges that we may charge,
thereby affecting our income.

Some municipalities may impose traffic congestion charges in urban areas, reduce the availability of
on-street parking spaces or promote the use of public transportation in lieu of automobiles. In addition,
certain municipalities may measure and charge for curb time parking, which could encourage courier
and package delivery services to use transportation methods other than cars. Governments may also

##### 40


-----

increase the tax levels on automobiles and petroleum for environmental reasons, which may reduce
traffic. Social perception and pressure relating to environmental concerns over the use of private cars
may similarly adversely impact the demand for our facilities. In addition, municipalities may promote
environmentally-friendly initiatives by reducing the number of parking spaces and encourage the use
of public transport for attendees of large public events and gatherings, trade fairs and transportation
hubs. Furthermore, the government in certain cities may reduce the parking tariffs of their parking
facilities in order to compete with other cities and private companies. We may also be materially
adversely affected by temporary or permanent changes to traffic routes or road closures, which may
make it more difficult to access our parking facilities and have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain
municipalities in Austria and Italy also imposed “free parking” to accelerate the recovery of inner-cities
or to support essential workers. If these free parking arrangements were to be extended or expanded,
our results of operations could be affected.

**_We have a large amount of fixed costs, and if we experience a decrease in our revenue, our operating_**
**_expenses and rent payments will not decrease at the same rate, which could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our net cash flows, margins and profits._**

Many of the expenses associated with operating parking facilities are relatively fixed. These expenses
include a large portion of our rent expenses, personnel costs, information technology costs, maintenance
and repair and cleaning costs, insurance and utilities. If we are unable to decrease our costs significantly
or rapidly when demand for our parking spaces decreases, the decline in our revenue can have a
particularly adverse effect on our net cash flows and profits. This effect can be especially pronounced
during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Where cost cutting efforts are
insufficient to offset declines in revenue, in particular in respect of our leased car parking facilities, we
could experience a material decline in margins and potentially negative cash flows which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We may also be unable to terminate on short notice or renegotiate unprofitable or disadvantageous
leases or management contracts. In addition, we may be required to honor our contractual lease
provisions or possibly pay considerable amounts in compensation or damages. Furthermore, our
auditors may require us to book onerous contract provisions in relation to unprofitable or
disadvantageous leases or management contracts, which may significantly increase our operating loss.
These lease agreements may negatively impact our profitability, and may have significant adverse
effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, we may be required to recognize unprofitable or disadvantageous leases or management
contracts as onerous contracts under IAS 37 and record a provision in our financial statements for the
loss we expect to make on such contracts. This may negatively impact our EBITDA and our leverage
ratios under the restrictive debt covenants to which we will be subject and consequently limit our ability
to finance our future operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.
See “—We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future
_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities.”_

**_We are subject to competition that can constrain our ability to acquire new parking facilities, and_**
**_win and renew parking lease contracts, concessions and management contracts for parking services._**

The parking sector in Europe is a competitive market, with a variety of competitors ranging from local
single-facility operators to regional, national and international operators with a significant number of
parking spaces. While the largest owners and operators in the industry are municipalities, other large
competitors include divisions of diversified global corporations with substantial financial, management
and other resources and capabilities.

In Western Europe, many long-term parking lease contracts and management contracts for parking
facilities are awarded and renewed through competitive tenders. A significant number of competing
entities may bid on a parking facility tender. Generally, public tenders for on- and off-street leases and

##### 41


-----

off-street management contracts are competitive and primarily determined based on economic terms.
Some of our competitors or new entrants to the market may be able to bid at lower prices, or offer
additional incentives such as upgrades to the facility. They may be able to realize synergies or operate
the facility in as part of a cluster, which would allow them to charge higher parking tariffs. We also
may underestimate our cost to run a new facility, or we may overestimate the amount of volume that a
new facility will generate, and our bid may contemplate rental or operating costs that are too high for
the applicable facility to support. In such a case a facility may turn out to be unprofitable because we
are paying too much in rent or are generating too little in management fees. In such a situation, that
facility will negatively impact our margins and EBITDA.

In addition, certain landlords, including municipalities, may choose not to retender a car park once it
has expired, but rather in-source and operate the car parks themselves. This decision on the part of the
landlord can result in a loss of revenue or the loss of opportunity to tender for a competitor’s former
lease and increased competition for other car parks. As a result of such competition we may not be able
to win new tenders or renew tenders on commercially favorable terms or at all, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Tenders may be subject to modification or interpretation by the granting party and awards of tenders_**
**_may be challenged by third parties._**

The municipalities and large companies who award parking tenders are entitled to interpret the tender
contract, resolve any doubt regarding execution, modify it for reason of public interest, terminate it
early and determine the effects of such termination. The awarding party may contractually modify a
tender agreement for public interest reasons that may affect the terms of the service provision or the
price of tariffs paid by users. Additionally, unsuccessful bidders may challenge the decision of an
awarding authority before the courts. Any decision adopted by a granting authority with respect to a
competitive bidding process may be challenged be a third party provided this party has a legitimate
interest in the result of the annulment of such decision. There can be no assurance that our right to
contracts we have won through a competitive bidding process will be upheld. The modification of such
agreements by the granting authority, delays caused by claims brought by unsuccessful bidders and
cancellation or rescission by a court of our tender agreements could have significant adverse effects on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our lease contracts and management contracts have limited durations and are subject to termination_**
**_by the contracting counterparty under the various terms and conditions._**

Our leases and management contracts are typically long-term arrangements with an average remaining
life for our top 100 contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the
year ended December 31, 2019) of approximately 12 years. Of our top 20 contracts by Pre-IFRS 16
Contract Contribution, only four are up for renewal by the end of 2026, representing approximately
3.9% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019. There may be
significant competition to renew existing leases or management contracts. This risk is more pronounced
where the contract is with a public authority and where a bidding process is required as opposed to with
a private landlord where we can initiate bilateral discussions ahead of upcoming lease expirations.
Approximately 33% of our revenue in 2019 was with public or quasi-public authorities versus with
private landlords. The loss of, or the renewal on less commercially favorable terms of, a significant
number of our existing facilities, or one or more of our largest facilities, could materially adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We are also subject to the termination rights set forth in the terms and conditions in our agreements.
For example, in some of our contracts, a change in our shareholders may trigger the counterparty’s right
to terminate the lease or management contract. A counterparty may also seek to terminate if we are not
meeting our contractual requirements under the contract, such as maintenance obligations. The early
termination by the relevant authorities of one or more of our lease or management contracts could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_If we fail to stay current with developments in technology necessary for our business, our operations_**
**_could be harmed and our ability to compete effectively could be diminished_**

New technologies are changing the current parking market, resulting in an increased focus on
information technology developments. Sophisticated information technology and other systems,
including systems for the efficient collection and management of revenue are integral to our business.
In order to maintain the quality of our operations, we refine, update or replace our information
technology and other systems with more advanced systems on a regular basis.

Motorists increasingly use mobile phone applications and online parking reservation services that allow
them to reserve parking at garages, lots and directly with individual owners. As a result, we constantly
develop new applications and upgrade our information technology to adapt to changing preferences, to
keep up with market demand for new services and to match services offered by our competitors. For
example, in 2018 we also launched our APCOA FLOW system, which is an open, digital and scalable
cloud-based platform which connects most of our parking garages, including parking technology, with
our customers and their vehicles via smartphone apps. This system also provides real time data on
occupancy and availability of our parking facilities. Our competitors may develop more efficient or
popular solutions, which could attract more customers seeking to park their cars and could affect our
business, operations and revenues.

Developing and maintaining our systems will require significant capital. If we are unable to introduce
information technology and other systems as quickly as our competitors our ability to compete
effectively could be diminished. If we are unable to replace outdated or broken systems within budgeted
costs or on schedule, our operations could be harmed. Our operations could also be harmed and our
ability to compete diminished if we are unable to realize the intended benefits of any new information
technology or other systems. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations or financial condition. Further, if we fail to keep up with technological advances in our
industry, including advances to maintain or improve our cost-effectiveness or that add value to the
services we can offer to customers, our brand may be diminished which may harm our ability to win
new leases and management contracts.

**_Our information technology systems may fail or be interrupted, which could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business. In addition, cyber-attacks on our information systems and any failure to_**
**_maintain the integrity of customer data could harm our reputation and subject us to costs, fines and_**
**_lawsuits._**

We rely on numerous information technology systems that allow us to monitor and manage our parking
spaces and facilities, control and collect fees, maintain our financial records, manage our employees
and gather information which our management team uses to make decisions regarding our business,
including technical information that is used formulate bids for spaces or contracts. The operation of our
business is increasingly dependent on the use of these systems. As a result, system failures or disruptions
resulting from computer viruses, cyber-attacks, cyber terrorism, security breaches or other causes could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

We also collect and retain large volumes of internal, employee and customer data, including credit card
numbers, license plates and other personally identifiable information during the normal course of
business. Using our various information technology systems, we collect, process, analyze and report
such data. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our
business. Our customers and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal
information and adhere to information security and privacy regulations. These regulations are
increasingly demanding in the jurisdictions where we operate. Theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use
of customer, employee or company data could harm our reputation and result in remedial and other
costs, fines and lawsuits, which may be material. See “—We are subject to stringent data privacy laws
_of each jurisdiction in which we operate and may be adversely affected by changes in the laws and_
_regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate and be exposed to increased compliance costs”_

##### 43

**_The rates that we can charge our parking customers may be subject to limitations set forth in the_**
**_lease contract or may be limited by law._**

In certain circumstances we may be required to limit the parking tariffs we can charge to customers
based on governmental regulations or contractual limitations. For example, in our contracts with
municipalities or other government entities the maximum tariffs we can charge to our customers are set
by the client and we are not allowed to increase such tariffs above the established limit. These
restrictions may impact our profitability from our operations. If the pricing structures at facilities we
operate restrict us from profitably operating our facilities and we are unable to adjust them due to
contractual or regulatory limitations, we could experience a material decline in the profitability of or a
loss with respect our facilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations or financial condition. Moreover, limitations on our ability to increase parking tariffs could
negatively affect our ability to effectively address issues arising from factors that are outside of our
control, such as exposure to inflation and increases in minimum or market wages. Furthermore, our
business may be adversely affected if governments chose to reduce parking fees or introduce free
parking to make certain locations, such as inner cities, more attractive to consumers or to support
essential workers, such as at hospitals.

**_Changes in the legal and regulatory framework for the management and operation of parking_**
**_facilities may impose significant costs on us._**

We must comply with a variety of laws and regulations relating to our leases, some of which impose
substantial financial and other penalties for non-compliance. In addition, we are exposed to the risk of
changes in the regulatory regime, which could potentially impose additional costs on our business or
subject us to more onerous operating requirements, and thus have an adverse impact on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

**_If our landlords or property owners face financial difficulties, our leases or ability to operate certain_**
**_of our facilities may be adversely affected._**

If our landlords or other persons owning the properties in which our facilities are located experience
financial difficulties, we may be exposed to certain risks such as poor infrastructure in the areas
surrounding and servicing our parking facilities or the closure of stores or other attractions drawing
customers to our facilities, thereby decreasing the demand for those parking spaces. We may be required
to initiate legal proceedings to claim amounts owed under management contracts.

These risks may be exacerbated by the impact of a future economic downturn in Europe and potential
austerity measures imposed by the national governments or by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
If our landlords are unable to effectively address financial difficulties they are facing or become subject
to bankruptcy proceedings, we may be exposed to the risk of closure of our facilities and renegotiation
or loss of our contracts.

Additionally, approximately 33% of 2019 revenue was with municipalities or other public or quasipublic entities. If a municipality with which we have an agreement faces financial difficulties we may
be exposed to certain risks such as poorly maintained infrastructure in the areas surrounding and
servicing the relevant facilities. Furthermore, certain municipalities facing financial challenges may be
reluctant or unwilling to pay compensation amounts to which we are entitled under the relevant
agreements. As a result, we may be required to initiate legal proceedings. This risk would be further
exacerbated by an economic downturn in Europe. If a municipality with whom we have a contract
experiences financial difficulties we are still obliged to continue providing services under our long-term
contracts, regardless of outstanding revenues or compensation owed, which could materially adversely
affect our business, results of operations or financial condition

**_Certain transfers of our leases, including indirect transfers are or may be subject to the prior approval_**
**_of our counterparties to those contracts, and, under certain of our long-term contracts, insolvency_**
**_proceedings or a change of control may result in the termination of the agreement._**

In certain cases, counterparties impose contractual restrictions on transfers of our rights, including
change of control clauses, which prohibit the transfer of our rights without the relevant counterparties’
prior approval. Under the terms of certain of our long-term contracts and/or under applicable law, the
counterparty to the contract may have the right to terminate the agreement in the event that insolvency
or winding-up proceedings are instituted or, upon the occurrence of certain events, if we are in breach
of our obligations under such agreements.

In the event of an enforcement action under the terms of the Notes or the Guarantees that results in the
transfer of ownership of the Issuer or any other Guarantor, or a change in the shareholding of the Issuer
for other reasons, one or more counterparties may argue that an indirect transfer also requires their prior
approval. As such, the counterparty may attempt to cancel our contract if such change of control clauses
exist in the relevant contract and such approval is not sought or granted. In addition, the uncertainty
concerning the transferability of such contracts itself could reduce the value placed on such contracts
by third parties and ultimately reduce the amount recovered in the event of an enforcement action.

**_If we are unable to maintain our reputation as a quality operator, we may be unable to win bids to_**
**_renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts, and our business, results of operations or_**
**_financial condition may be materially and adversely affected._**

Since our revenue depends on cash flows from operating parking facilities under long-term contracts,
it is important that we maintain good relationships with landlords and property owners in order to bid
for, win and renew contracts. In addition, our reputation as a reliable operator of parking facilities is
important in winning and renewing contracts. We believe the experience of our management, the quality
of our reputation in the key markets in which we operate and the rapport that we maintain with landlords
and property owners differentiates us from our competitors and are important factors for the generation
of new business opportunities that support our growth. However, if we are unable to maintain good
working relationships with the landlords and property owners, or if we do not meet or exceed their
expectations, such parties may be unwilling to maintain or grow their business with us, in which case
our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

**_Our ability to expand our business by leasing new parking facilities will be dependent upon the_**
**_availability and cost of capital._**

We intend to continue to expand our business through organic growth. We typically make certain capital
expenditures at newly leased sites to introduce or upgrade equipment and facilities. Our ability to
expand our business will depend in part upon the availability of adequate capital, which in turn requires
cash flow generated by our business and the availability of debt and equity financing. Any economic
downturn, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a negative impact on the
availability of excess cash and the availability and cost of bank financing. If we are unable to obtain the
funds needed on acceptable terms, we will not be able to continue to expand our operations, which
could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We may not be able to successfully realize our strategy to acquire other parking facility operators._**

The off-street car parking industry in Europe is highly fragmented with a limited number of large
players. Accordingly, market dynamics make it possible for large private players to acquire small
competitors at attractive multiples and as such, we are focused on growing in part through acquisitions.
We expect to continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses that complement our operations.
However, there can be no assurance that any acquisition we make in the future will deliver the
anticipated benefits. In addition, the process of integrating an acquired business may create unforeseen
difficulties, take longer than expected, result in the incurrence of unexpected costs and expenses or we

##### 45


-----

may not realize the synergies or operational advantages expected. The risks we face in connection with
any potential acquisition of a business include, but are not limited to:

- management time and focus may be diverted from operating our business to acquisition
integration;

- clients or key employees of an acquired business may not remain, which could negatively
impact our ability to grow that acquired business;

- we may face competition from management or key employees of an acquired business in case
of their departure;

- integration of the acquired business’s accounting, information technology, human resources,
and other administrative systems may fail to permit effective management and expense
reduction;

- implementing internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company in
an acquired business that lacked some of these controls, procedures and policies may fail;

- additional indebtedness incurred as a result of an acquisition may impact our financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows; and

- unanticipated or unknown operational, commercial or technical issues or liabilities may arise
relating to the acquired business.

If we fail to identify and enter into attractive markets, to identify and operate facilities on acceptable
terms, to attract, hire and retain skilled staff, to implement the appropriate infrastructure or to raise the
required funds to successfully complete acquisitions, our business plans may be jeopardized and the
intended consolidation or increase of our market share may fail to materialize, which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**_Certain adjusted, underlying and pro forma consolidated financial information included in this_**
**_Offering Memorandum is presented for illustrative purposes only and our actual results of operations_**
**_may differ._**

We have presented in this Offering Memorandum certain adjusted financial data that has been prepared
to give effect to the Transactions as well as to certain other adjustments made to calculate the Pro Forma
Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA as described in more detail under “Summary—Summary Financial and
_Other Data—Pro Forma and As Adjusted Financial Information.” Such adjusted financial data has been_
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what the actual consolidated
financial position or financial information would have been had the Transactions or other adjustments
actually occurred as of the dates indicated, nor does such adjusted financial data purport to project our
consolidated financial position and financial information at any future date or for any future period. The
financial information for the twelve months presented in this Offering Memorandum includes nonGAAP measures and is based on available information and certain assumptions and estimates that we
believe are reasonable and may differ materially from the actual amounts. We also present Pro Forma
Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, which gives effect to the estimated full-year effect of certain
acquisitions, contract wins or contract terminations as if each of such event had occurred on January 1,
2019, and in the case of acquisitions and contract wins, including assumptions about the performance
of such acquisition or contract during the first twelve months of ownership or execution by us. Pro
_Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on a basis of implementation that contemplates_
interest expense, depreciation and debt on a pre-IFRS 16 basis. Furthermore, Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated assuming the EBITDA achieved by the Company in 2019, rather than
2020 or the twelve months ended March 31, 2021. Because of the material adverse effects that the
COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, we do not believe EBITDA from 2020 or the twelve
months ended March 31, 2021 is an accurate reflection of our long-term business going forward.

##### 46


-----

Nevertheless, we cannot give any assurance that our EBITDA or other financial results will return to
the levels of 2019. The adjustments made to calculate the financial information for the twelve months
of new business contract and/or company performance and to calculate _Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16_
Adjusted EBITDA are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable
in the circumstances. In particular, we have estimated the twelve months EBITDA contribution from
our new business contracts and/or companies acquired by us based on available data and certain
assumptions, including parking volumes and pricing, and these contracts or new companies may not be
as profitable as we have anticipated. This adjusted and pro forma data has been prepared for illustrative
purposes only and has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the
U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. The adjustments have not been
audited by any independent auditors, should not be considered indicative of actual results that would
have been achieved had the events for which we have made the adjustment been completed as the dates
stated and do not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or financial position.
The actual results may differ significantly from those presented for a number of reasons, including, but
not limited to, differences in assumptions used.

In addition, the pro forma adjustments made to calculate Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA
include estimated synergies that we expect to realize from the implementation of new acquisitions into
our operations but exclude future events that may occur after this Offering, including the potential nonrealization of revenue synergies, cost savings, expense reductions and contribution from acquisitions or
the incurrence of implementation and investment costs related to the realization of such synergies, and
contribution from acquisitions or new contracts, which may be material. The pro forma adjustments
made to calculate Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA also do not consider potential negative
impacts of market conditions on revenue or expenses. Such actual events may have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, we may fail
to realize any or all of the anticipated synergies.

**_Instances of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and privacy breaches involving our management,_**
**_employees, business partners or agents could expose us to penalties and reputational damage and_**
**_could hinder our ability to acquire or renew contracts or even continue our operating activities._**

The decentralized nature of our operations as well as our employees’ access to the cash that we collect
from our operations exposes us to potential theft and other criminal acts. For example, in 2016 one of
our employees in Norway stole approximately €0.5 million in coins from parking meter change drawers
over a period of approximately three years, and in the past we have had similar theft instances in other
jurisdictions. While we have a compliance program and internal policies in place to mitigate the risks
of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and privacy breaches in the contract tender processes we engage in
and for our business as a whole, we cannot assure that we can detect or prevent every instance of theft,
fraud, bribery, corruption or breaches of privacy involving our employees, business partners or agents.

We may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and to reputational damage as a result of such
incidents. Instances of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and breaches of privacy may also be taken into
account as a negative factor by public authorities or private companies in evaluating our bids to acquire
or renew contracts. Such incidents could result in a prohibition to tender for, or could otherwise prevent
us from winning or renewing contracts, or make it more difficult for us to win or renew contracts in the
future. Any involvement or association of our senior management, employees, business partners,
suppliers or agents with theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and breaches of privacy, or allegations or
rumors relating thereto, could negatively impact our reputation and materially adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, in 2018 we lost an on-street tender
in Antwerp, Belgium, due to reputational issues resulting from a former fraud case in that city that was
first identified in 2016, where one of our former technical directors was found guilty of large scale theft
after we uncovered that he had stolen approximately €5 million in coins from parking meter change
drawers over a period of at least five years, and in the past we had similar, albeit smaller, case of theft
in other jurisdictions. As a result of this case, we hired third party advisors to assist us with identifying
areas of risk. We have implemented several measures in order to prevent similar cases from occurring

-----

in the future that we deem adequate and we continuously review and upgrade our compliance policies.
We also have a dedicated internal audit and compliance team in place. However, we cannot guarantee
that these measures will be effective in reducing such cases from happening in the future or at all. In
addition, we have in place a whistleblower program, through which we have in the past received, and
we may in the future receive, allegations of compliance breaches by our employees, such as for fraud,
bribery, political contributions and embezzlement. We have systems in place to thoroughly investigate
such allegations, and although to date (and except as noted above) our investigations have resulted in
such allegations being dismissed or not being found material, there can be no assurance that our
investigations were sufficient or that future allegations will not result in compliance breaches in the
future. Any actual or alleged compliance breaches could result in adverse publicity and/or have material
adverse effects on our business or results of operations.

**_In the auditor’s report on our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements there was attention_**
**_drawn to uncertainty on the future and the impact that could have on continuing as a going concern._**

The auditor’s report on our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, issued by
PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft, our independent auditors, contains
an emphasis of matter paragraph on the material uncertainty related to the ability of the Group to
continue as a going concern. This paragraph draws attention to note “43 Group Risk Management—
Going Concern” of the notes to our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, where the
executive directors describe that in connection with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern depends on the timing of the recovery of the business
and hence, the achievement of the Group’s forecast earnings and cash flows, and respectively, the
continuing financial support of the shareholders and the core banks. As stated in the note “43 Group
Risk Management—Going Concern” in the notes to our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, these events and conditions indicate along with other matters stated there that a material
uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
and that represents a risk that the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is threatened
pursuant to section 322 paragraph 2 sentence 3 of the German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch—
HGB). The audit opinion on the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements is not modified in
respect of this matter. None of our financial information included in this Offering Memorandum,
including our 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, include any adjustments that may result
from this uncertainty. The auditor’s report on our 2020 Audited Financial Statements does not contain
an emphasis of matter paragraph, as the various measures taken by the Group to counteract the impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations were deemed sufficient to ensure the Group’s
status as a going concern, secure capital and liquidity by providers of equity and debt capital and to
safeguard against further negative developments from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the COVID19 pandemic has had and continues to have a substantial impact on our business, primarily due to a
significant reduction in volume of traffic at our car parks as a result of the restrictions on movement
and other social distancing measures imposed by governments in Europe in response to the COVID-19
pandemic. See “Risks Related to our Business and Industry—The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19
_have disrupted our operations, which have had and may continue to have a negative adverse effect on_
_our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.” Our ability to forecast our pace_
of recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the eventual levels to which our results of
operations will return as well as our cash flows are dependent on when and the extent to which we can
return to our pre-pandemic operating levels. Although our 2020 Audited Financial Statements do not
contain an emphasis of matter paragraph, if one or more of the assumptions in making our assessment
to report as a going concern are found to be incorrect, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.
If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we would have to liquidate our assets and may receive
less that the value at which those assets are carried on our 2020 Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, and investors could lose a part or all of their investment in the Notes.

**_We are subject to stringent data privacy laws of each jurisdiction in which we operate and may be_**
**_adversely affected by changes in the laws and regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate_**
**_and be exposed to increased compliance costs._**

We routinely collect and process sensitive customer data and information and, while we believe we
have taken reasonable and appropriate steps to protect that information from security breaches, data
loss and computer viruses, if our security procedures and controls were compromised, unintentionally
or through cyber-attacks, customer data or information could be accessed by unauthorized third-parties.
In addition, some customer information and data is stored with third-parties who may also be subject to
the risk of cyber-attack or access by unauthorized third-parties. Furthermore, the regulatory
environment governing the use of individually identifiable data of customers, employees and others is
complex. We must comply with data protection and privacy laws in the EU and other relevant
jurisdictions, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Under the General Data Protection
Regulation the relevant data protection authorities have the power to impose administrative fines for
data protection compliance violations, including fines of up to a maximum of €20 million or 4% of the
Group’s global annual turnover of the preceding financial year in certain cases.

Privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently and compliance with them
may require us to incur costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative
processes. The implementation of any such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, any failure of our security systems or
the security systems of third-parties that results in customer data or information becoming available to
unauthorized third-parties may result in damage to our reputation and the loss of customers. This may
adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any failure to comply with
data protection laws may harm our reputation or lead to investigations, sanctions, penalties, proceedings
or actions against us by governmental agencies, private individuals or companies, including privacy
class action litigation in certain jurisdictions, resulting in higher expenditures to adequately protect us
against such information security breaches.

**_Changes in credit and debit card provider requirements or applicable regulations could adversely_**
**_affect our business._**

A substantial portion of our sales are made to customers that pay for their purchases with credit or debit
cards, rather than with cash. We are exposed to a variety of risks associated with credit and debit cards.
In connection with credit and debit card payments, we pay interchange and other fees. These fees may
increase over time and thus increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our business, results
of operations and financial condition if we are unable to increase our parking tariffs accordingly. We
are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules
governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or
impossible for us to comply. Any failure to comply with applicable requirements or regulations may
expose us to fines and higher transaction fees, the loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card
payments from our customers or the cessation of payments from credit and debit card providers to us
for purchases already made. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, any material failure by us or our service providers to maintain compliance with the
payment card industry security requirements or to rectify a data security issue may result in fines and
restrictions on our ability to accept credit cards as a form of payment. The regulatory framework for
data privacy and protection with respect to credit card information is uncertain for the foreseeable
future, and it is possible that legal and regulatory obligations may continue to increase and may be
interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent or possibly conflicting from one jurisdiction to
another. In addition, changes in regulations that require us to update or replace our parking and
operational infrastructure, including our points of payments and/or payment systems, may expose us to
significant additional costs, which may have an adverse effect on our business. For example, changes
to the Payment Card Industry standard have in the past required us (and may require us in the future) to

##### 49


-----

upgrade most of our points of payment and payment systems in certain of our jurisdictions of operations,
which resulted in several million euros of additional costs. In addition, changes to legislation (including
tax laws) that affect how our points of payments work or account for transactions may require additional
investments in the future.

**_Contractual and other disagreements with counterparties could result in liability and litigation costs_**
**_or other expenses, which could lower our profits. Under the terms of our contracts, counterparties_**
**_may terminate such agreements if we do not successfully comply with our obligations._**

From time to time, we are involved in contractual and other disagreements with counterparties relating
to our parking facilities and agreements and our operations under such agreements. Such disagreements
are more likely to occur during periods of challenging economic conditions. We generally are required
to maintain the relevant parking facility in satisfactory condition throughout the term of the contract,
and upon the expiration of each agreement to turn over substantially all assets related to such agreement
to the relevant counterparties without financial compensation. Certain of our contracts require us to sell
our equipment at book value once a contract is terminated. If a counterparty claims that we have failed
to comply with the terms of our agreements, the contract may be revoked or we may not be successful
in extending or renewing the agreement at the end of its term, in either case we may have to compensate
the counterparty as a result. Any such disputes could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations.

If a governmental authority decides to terminate or amend our space agreements due to a serious
violation of our contractual or regulatory obligations, such as failure to maintain the facility in such a
way that it creates a serious danger to users or a persistent failure to make payments, we may not be
entitled to full compensation for our initial investment or loss of anticipated profits from the agreement.
If any of our existing significant spaces or other agreements are unilaterally terminated by one of the
counterparties, our revenues in the future may be reduced, and our business, results of operations or
financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

**_We may incur higher than expected costs as a result of unforeseen maintenance requirements or_**
**_investments._**

Generally, our maintenance costs are relatively stable. However, we may experience unforeseen
problems such as water damage, cracks in the walls or foundation or sinking among other things, for
which we may become liable if we fail to timely notify our landlords. In addition, under the terms of
certain of our agreements in respect of parking facilities that we do not legally own, we are responsible
for maintenance and upkeep. If we were to experience a significant problem requiring repairs, our
maintenance costs may be higher than expected or we may be forced to suspend or reduce operations
at the affected facility until such time as the issue is resolved. Such increased expenses or any reduction
in revenue due to unexpected facility closures may have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition.

From time to time we make investments in our properties to make them more attractive to customers or
to increase the ways in which we can generate revenue at those properties. We are currently expanding
our core business under the brand “APCOA Urban Hubs”. Through this program, we seek to use our
parking areas for logistics, mobility, EV charging and new technologies services. For example, the
introduction and popularity of electric cars requires investment in infrastructure, such as charging points
and plug-ins, which may lead to increased infrastructure and energy costs in case we are unable to
negotiate funding from our partners. Our investments will require capital, and we may not have
sufficient liquidity to make such investments or to make our properties attractive to customers. Our
investments may not draw new customers to our facilities and may not turn out to be profitable. In
addition, we may experience unforeseen issues arising from alternative uses of our car parks which may
prove to be costly to rectify. For example, if we see lower than expected demand for charging points
and higher than expected demand for logistics and storage, we may be required to make additional
investments to address customer demand and increase profitability of our facilities.

##### 50


-----

We manage the construction of two to three parking facilities on average each year. We are thus exposed
to a number of risks associated with large-scale construction projects, such as the failure of our
contractors and subcontractors to perform, as well as delays and disruptions caused by technical or
environmental problems, adverse weather conditions or other factors. Generally, pursuant to the terms
of the relevant agreements, our contractors and subcontractors are required to indemnify us for delays
in completing the project on time and any losses resulting therefrom. Once the construction of a parking
facility on a new site is completed, we are exposed to a variety of risks in connection with the opening
and operation of the new parking facility, which could result in us failing to recover our investment in
the new parking facility. For example, the actual demand for parking spaces at the new site may not
meet our expectations, and we may experience lower than expected volumes and revenues. Further, in
a small number of our contracts we are responsible not only for the maintenance and upkeep of the
facilities that we construct but also for structural and mechanical repairs of such facilities which can
lead to significantly increased expenses in case any unforeseen structural issues occur.

**_Labor disputes and other labor matters could lead to loss of revenues or higher costs._**

We may experience labor disputes in certain situations resulting in strikes, work slowdowns or other
actions that may cause the effective closure of our facilities, the need to offer free parking on a
temporary basis or other events that disrupt us from providing services, all of which would result in
reduced revenues. We have collective bargaining arrangements in place in Sweden, Norway, Austria
and Denmark (with respect to employees on our contract with the Billund Airport) which provide
employment rights to our work force and may require us to expend greater time and cost to alter or
amend employees’ terms of employment or discontinuing employment relationships. If we are made to
negotiate additional collective bargaining arrangements with our work force in other jurisdictions where
we operate, it could result in a substantial increase in labor costs that we may be unable to recover
through our existing contractual arrangements. Further, under applicable law, we have works councils
in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. We are required to seek such councils’ advice
and consider any recommendations regarding certain business decisions we make from time to time
and, for certain decisions, also seek such councils’ consent. Although we have not experienced any
material collective labor disputes in the past and believe we currently enjoy good relationships with our
works councils and employees, there can be no assurance that labor disputes will not arise in the future,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Additionally, we may incur expenses in resolving disputes and complying with local laws relating to
overtime, social security and pension contributions, occupational risk matters and other labor related
issues. We may also incur increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage, employee
benefit costs, medical benefits costs or other factors, which could adversely impact our business, results
of operations or financial condition. For example, a significant number of our employees are subject to
minimum wage laws. Any increase in the applicable minimum wage may decrease our margins, as we
may not be able to recover such wage increases through increased pricing (in the case of lease contracts)
or through increased management fees (in the case of management contracts).

**_We are exposed to the risk of rising labor costs, as well as work stoppages, strikes or other collective_**
**_actions which might negatively impact our profitability._**

As of March 31, 2021, we had 3,980 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”). Personnel expenses represent a
large portion of our cost base. Wages may increase as a result of worker shortages following the
COVID-19 pandemic, which could make it more challenging or costly for us to hire and retain workers.
Certain governments, including Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom, have imposed statutory
minimum wages. The imposition of statutory minimum wages by other governments, or future increases
of statutory minimum wages or any general increase in wages due to worker shortages or inflation or
otherwise may impact our cost base. We may also be required to raise wages because of pressure exerted
by trade unions or general wage increases. Wage increases and the associated rise in labor costs could
negatively affect our profitability. Furthermore, labor costs may increase indirectly due to the
application of complex collective labor laws and the establishment of works councils. Employees who
are members of works councils must be exempted from their work duties at full pay so that they can
participate in works council activities. In addition, it is possible that labor costs may rise due to an

##### 51


-----

increase in labor related litigation. For example we could be subject to claims arising from the
termination of employment arrangements, continuous remuneration or overtime compensation
schemes.

**_Natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events could disrupt our services._**

Natural disasters, such as storms, earthquakes or floods, acts of terrorism and other unexpected events,
such as large-scale electrical power supply outages, fires and vandalism, may result in reduced revenues
for our parking businesses. Natural disasters may also cause economic dislocations throughout urban
areas, regions or countries. In addition, terrorist attacks have resulted in, and may continue to result in,
heightened security and traffic control measures in urban areas and increased government regulation of
airport facilities. For example, the terrorist attacks in large cities in the United Kingdom, Germany,
France and Belgium could have a negative impact on customer travel and traffic levels in a number of
locations where we operate parking facilities. Increased security protocols in airports and public
perception of terrorist threats may lead customers to seek alternative means of transportation such as
coaches or trains, in particular for national travel, which could have a negative impact on occupancy of
our car parks at airports. The occurrence and consequences of such events are unpredictable, and further
attacks could temporarily reduce traffic levels and decrease volumes for our parking facilities, thus
causing a reduction in revenues. Our insurance may not be sufficient to cover claims arising from such
events. Significant damage to or destruction of one of the facilities we operate may also result in the
termination of the contract. Additionally, such events could cause interruptions in our monitoring or
other information technology systems, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations or financial condition.

**_Our business is seasonal and we may also be impacted by adverse weather conditions in our markets._**

The demand for spaces at our parking facilities is seasonal, with the greatest demand for parking
generally occurring during holiday travel seasons and during November and December in the build up
to Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Under normal operating circumstances, this usually results in
stronger results of operations in the third and fourth quarters of our financial year and more moderate
results of operations in the first and second quarters of our financial year. This seasonality in our
demand, cost and profitability structures has resulted in fluctuations in our revenue and results of
operations. Accordingly, seasonality in our operations could adversely affect our financial results. In
particular, adverse factors, such as travel restriction measures during the third and fourth quarters of
2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may have an outsized impact on our revenue because these
quarters are important to our annual results.

Volume at our parking facilities may also be impacted by adverse weather conditions. Generally in the
markets in which we operate, during periods of inclement weather, customers often choose to not travel.
As a result, if we experience periods of prolonged adverse weather, volumes at our facilities may
decrease and our results may be materially impacted.

**_Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be_**
**_involved in the normal course of our business could materially adversely affect our business, results_**
**_of operations or financial condition._**

In the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. Such litigation includes
litigation in relation to our permits, planning and operation activities, and may also result from injuries
or property damage to our customers or their property while using our facilities, from claims arising
against us relating to construction at our facilities, claims from employees or landlords or breach of
applicable laws and regulations. For example, we are currently in a dispute with our two largest clients
in Germany over the levels of rent payable to them. In addition, we enter into partnerships with various
business partners and are members of trade associations and we may be jointly and severally liable for
judgments or claims made against such partners or trade associations. We may face litigation during the
liquidation of a contract. We provision for such claims in the ordinary course of business, however, in
the event we are ordered to pay more than this amount, our reserves may not be sufficient. It is possible

##### 52


-----

that an unfavorable outcome of some or all such matters could cause us to incur significant liabilities.
Likewise, we may incur significant legal and other costs in connection with defending our interests in
ongoing legal proceedings. Any significant adverse litigation judgments or settlements could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_We are exposed to risks associated with our parking enforcement services._**

In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in disputes with consumers to whom we have issued
control fees, which may result in the incurrence of additional costs and a delay in processing the control
fee, which may adversely affect our net working capital. In addition, changing or more consumerfriendly legislation regulating the amount of control fees that we can charge (including any associated
administrative costs) or the handling of disputes over control fees may decrease our revenue from
parking enforcement services, increase our cost base and adversely affect our business. In addition,
even if a dispute is resolved in our favor, we may be unable to collect the full amount due to us as a
result of limitations on the amount that we are permitted to charge consumers. Lastly, if we outsource
the collection of control fees and fines, we only receive a certain percentage of the nominal value due
to us.

**_We may have disputes with our contracted parking customers._**

We enter into monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets with parking customers, which provide us
with significant revenue stability. Contract parking fees are fixed for the duration of the agreement with
the client and typically collected in advance of the utilization of our parking facilities. We may in some
cases have disputes with contracted parking customers, whether as a result of the maintenance of our
facilities, facility closures or other factors. These disputes may result in customers cancelling or not
renewing their season tickets, or it may result in us being required to return the ticket fees to the
customer or in litigation, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.

**_We may violate intellectual property rights of third-parties and be liable for damages and litigation_**
**_costs._**

Our brands and information technology assets may violate intellectual property rights, including
trademarks and rights, of third-parties. If we are perceived to have adopted trends or designs developed
by competitors, we may become subject to claims that we have violated the intellectual property rights
of others. We may be prevented by third-parties from using, sourcing or marketing certain service or
product ideas. If we violate a third party’s rights, we may be liable for damages as well as litigation
costs and may be obligated to change our services or brands or purchase a license to use such rights.
The potential damages may correspond to an amount of revenues, resulting in higher damages. This
may reduce our sales, erode margins or damage our reputation, any of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, in particular our key trademarks and key_**
**_domain names, our ability to compete could be adversely affected._**

The success of the services that we offer depends to a significant extent upon the value of our brands
and other rights. Therefore, our commercial success depends on our ability to successfully defend our
intellectual property, including trademarks, know how, client lists and domain names.

In particular, we own key trademarks used by our companies, numerous domain names and certain
other rights. We may also decide to file further trademark applications seeking to protect selected newly
developed brands or concepts, or apply for registration of existing brands or concepts in other relevant
jurisdictions as part of an international expansion, but cannot be sure that trademark registrations will
be issued. There is also a risk that we could, by omission, fail to renew a trademark on a timely basis or
that our competitors may challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued
to, or licensed by, us. In addition, even though a trademark has been duly registered, under local
regulation the fact that a trademark is not used for a certain period of time (such as five years in the EU)

##### 53


-----

may render the trademark registration voidable. Moreover, the effective and prior use of a name may
prevail over the registration of the trademark. With respect to domain names, these are generally
regulated by internet regulatory bodies and are also subject to trademark laws and other related laws of
each country.

If we do not have or cannot obtain or maintain on reasonable terms the ability to use our brands in a
particular country, or to use or register a certain domain name, we could be forced either to incur
significant additional expenses to market our services within that country, including the development
of a new brand and the creation of new promotional materials and packaging, or to elect not to provide
services in that country. Furthermore, there can be no assurance we will be able to adequately or
sufficiently prevent infringement or misappropriation of our portfolio of intellectual property by thirdparties. If any of these events occur, our ability to compete may be adversely affected. The realization
of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. In addition, our operations benefit from back office facilities and other support provided
by to us by AGILE Parking Solutions. Should AGILE Parking Solutions fail to provide such support
for us, we may not be able to to find an alternative service provider in a timely manner or at all, which
may have an adverse effect on our business.

**_We conduct business in multiple jurisdictions and are exposed to changes in tax laws, tax rates and_**
**_their application and interpretation in the markets in which we operate, and we have been (and may_**
**_continue to be) subject to significant claims related to tax disputes and audits._**

We are subject to tax laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Tax laws and
regulations are subject to change and may be subject to different interpretations (including, but not
limited to, changes in applicable tax rates and requirements relating to deductibility of interest,
withholding taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures).
Any of the foregoing changes may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of
operations. The structures of intra-group transactions and of our international operations, as well as
judgments we make or positions we take relating to tax matters, are based on our own interpretations
of applicable tax laws and regulations, generally relying on rulings or specific guidance from competent
tax authorities. We cannot guarantee that our interpretations of such laws will be accepted by the
relevant authorities and there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will not seek to challenge or
dispute such interpretations, and the current political climate and recent political and media focus on
tax optimization schemes and austerity generally increases the risk of discussions or disputes with tax
authorities. Any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations applicable to us may result in
reassessments, settlement amounts, late payment interest, fines and penalties and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Further, our operations that are profit making are subject to profit and income tax and other applicable
taxes, such as property tax. There is no guarantee that tax laws or tax rates may not be changed in the
future. Any change in tax laws or tax rates may increase our tax expenses and liabilities and could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We may be subject
to various tax proceedings and audits with tax authorities in respect of our operations. For example,
APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A. received a tax assessment notice from the City of Avellino regarding
charges and fees for occupying public land (TOSAP) for a total amount of €11.5 million for the 2013
to 2017 period (including interest and penalty surcharges). We successfully contested this assessment
for the period from 2013 to April 2015 in the first and second instance, and the municipality filed an
appeal. Our appeal against the notices for May 2015 to 2017 was rejected in the second instance, and
we have appealed this decision.

In addition to national tax laws, we are increasingly exposed to new taxes on regional and municipal
levels in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, parking fines are
subject to VAT. Exposure to these additional taxes has a negative impact on our profitability and
increases the risk of discussions or disputes with tax authorities.

##### 54


-----

We cannot assure you that we will not become subject to tax investigations in the future. If we were to
become subject to such investigations, we may be held liable for additional tax payments, including
penalties and interest for late payments, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in the period or periods for which that assessment
is made. Any adverse findings of the relevant tax authorities could also result in unfavorable tax
treatment for the transactions in question and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any
such investigations or challenges, such proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require
that we devote substantial time and resources to defend ourselves. Also, a material change in applicable
laws or regulations (including, but not limited to, changes in applicable tax rates), or in their
interpretation or enforcement, could force us to alter our business strategy, leading to additional costs
or loss of revenue, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and
financial condition.

**_We are subject to foreign exchange risk._**

We use the euro as our functional and reporting currency. At the same time, the majority of our revenues
are denominated in currencies other than the euro, including the Pound Sterling, Danish Kroner,
Swedish Krona, Norwegian Kroner, Swiss Franc and Polish Zloty. For the twelve months ended March
31, 2021, our operations in the United Kingdom accounted for 7.3% and 17.9%, respectively, of our
Contract Contribution and revenue; our operations in Denmark accounted for 8.7% and 11.2%,
respectively, of our Contract Contribution and revenue; our operations in Sweden accounted for 8.3%
and 12.9%, respectively, of our Contract Contribution and revenue; our operations in Norway accounted
for 12.5% and 12.3%, respectively, of our Contract Contribution and revenue; and revenue and our
operations in Switzerland accounted for approximately 3.7% and 1.8%, respectively, of our Contract
Contribution and revenue and our operations in Poland accounted for approximately 2.6% and 1.8%,
respectively, of our Contract Contribution and revenue. We are subject to currency translation risk when
the accounts of our businesses, denominated in the respective local currencies, are translated into our
consolidated accounts, denominated in euros. We cannot predict movements in such non-euro
currencies and there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate the effects of currency exchange
rate fluctuations will be successful or that our risk management procedures will operate successfully.

Although we currently do not hedge a material portion of our foreign currency risk we may choose to
do so again in the future. We are party to two interest hedging agreements to hedge our exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates relating to our lease liabilities in Denmark. Any hedges may not be
effective, and our hedging decisions may change at any time. Unfavorable interest and currency
fluctuations could also result in lower revenues and earnings for us, on a euro basis, from our parking
facilities outside the eurozone. Furthermore, foreign-sourced dividends by our subsidiaries may be
subject to unfavorable currency fluctuations when converted into euros, reducing the distribution
received by us on a euro basis. In addition, we may choose not to hedge the euro value of foreign
currencies. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will not be affected by
fluctuations in exchange rates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our_**
**_insurance costs may increase._**

We maintain a portfolio of insurance policies to help protect us against loss or damage incurred from a
wide variety of insurable risks. For instance, we have insurance coverage in respect of our customers
and parked cars provided by local and central agencies. Further, in every country where we operate, we
also have local general liability insurance coverage. Each year, we review, together with our
professional insurance advisors, whether the insurance policies and associated coverage that we
maintain are sufficient to adequately protect us from the various types of risk to which we are exposed.
That analysis takes into account various pertinent factors, such as the likelihood that we would incur a
material loss from any given risk, as well as the cost of obtaining insurance coverage against any such
risk. Notwithstanding our insurance coverage for all or any of these risks, we may experience one or

##### 55


-----

more material losses for which we do not maintain any or adequate insurance coverage that could
materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

**_Our business is dependent upon key personnel._**

Our success has been, and will continue to be, substantially dependent upon the continued services of
our management team, including our executives and our country leaders. The loss of the services of one
or more of the members of our management team could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations or financial condition. We have entered into employment agreements with, and
historically have been successful in retaining the services of, our management, however there can be no
assurance that we will be able to retain them in the future and any failure to do so could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We do not have any key man
life insurance policies in place. In addition, our continued growth depends upon our ability to attract
and retain skilled operating managers and employees. An inability to attract and retain qualified
members or key personnel in due time could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
operating results and financial position. See “Management.”

**_This Offering Memorandum contains market data and economic and industry data which are based_**
**_on assumptions from a pre-COVID-19 pandemic economic and social environment, many of which_**
**_may be outdated or no longer apply in a post-COVID-19 pandemic economic and social environment,_**
**_and such data may therefore no longer be accurate and subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty._**

The market data and economic and industry data presented in this Offering Memorandum include (i)
data from independent third-party data providers as well as information provided by us, i.e., proprietary
market research and (ii) information and statements reflecting the providers of the data reports
knowledge and estimates of the industry and markets in which we operate, in each case, at the date of
such reports. Certain of the industry data reports were commissioned prior to the outbreak of the
COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and, as shown by the emergence of
coronavirus variants, continues to develop and, accordingly, its end cannot be predicted. In addition,
these assessments did not take into account the long-term structural and other effects of this pandemic
on global economic activity or the near-term and medium-term effects of the countermeasures adopted
to contain its spread, including the travel restrictions and bans and reductions in business and leisure
airline travel, the practice of social distancing, quarantine advisories, shelter-in-place orders and
closures of businesses, even once these measures are lifted. For example, many businesses have gone
bankrupt or have otherwise been discontinued and unemployment rates in the markets in which we
operate generally have increased significantly since the onset of the pandemic. Many employers have
transitioned substantial portions of their employees to remote work arrangements and several
multinational employers have announced that they do not expect for all of their employees to return to
working in an office full-time or resume travelling at pre-pandemic rates once this pandemic has
subsided. These announcements are indicative of significant structural economic changes caused by the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional structural economic changes will likely emerge over the
remainder of the pandemic, many of which we cannot yet anticipate. As a result, the post-COVID-19
pandemic economic and social environment in the markets in which we operate will likely differ
significantly from the pre-COVID-19 pandemic economic and social environment in our markets.
Because the full extent of these shifts are not yet known or were not contemplated at the time of the
publication of the industry data reports, such reports do not reflect the full potential impact of this
pandemic and its consequences on the economy, society and markets in which we operate. The data
presented therein and used in this Offering Memorandum may therefore no longer be accurate and are
subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty.

**Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our business and prevent_**
**_us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and the Note Guarantees._**

Following the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. We cannot guarantee that we will be
able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations on an ongoing basis
or that we will remain cash flow positive once we take into account the debt service costs associated
with the Notes. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had €718.0
million of outstanding indebtedness (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), comprising the Notes, certain local credit
facilities and pre-IFRS 16 finance lease obligations. In addition, we have €80 million commitments
under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, of which (i) €30.5 million will be made available as
ancillary facilities pursuant to which bank guarantees may be issued, (ii) €17 million will be made
available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which cash loans may be drawn, and (iii) €32.5 million will
be available for utilization in accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The New
Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be undrawn on the Issue Date, except for €20.1 million of noncash guarantees currently issued under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and Existing Guarantee
Facility which will remain outstanding pursuant to the ancillary facilities described in the preceding
sentence.

The degree to which we will remain leveraged following the issuance of the Notes could have important
consequences to holders of the Notes offered hereby, including, but not limited to:

- making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes;

- increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment
of principal of, and interest on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash
flow, and limiting the ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital
expenditure, acquisitions, joint ventures or other general corporate purposes;

- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the
competitive environment and the industry in which we operate;

- placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, to the extent that they
are not as highly leveraged; and

- limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

Despite our substantial leverage, we may still be able to incur more debt under the Indenture, which
could further exacerbate the risks described above. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that with
respect to a distressed disposal of, or an enforcement of the security interests over, the Collateral,
holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain
other future indebtedness permitted under the Indenture have been repaid in full. Additionally, we could
raise additional debt that could be secured or could mature prior to the Notes. Although the Indenture
and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and
exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the New

##### 57


-----

Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not
constitute indebtedness under those agreements.

**_We will be subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future_**
**_operations and capital needs and to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

The Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will restrict, among other things, our
ability to:

- incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain preferred stock;

- create or incur certain liens;

- make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

- prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

- make certain loans, investments or acquisitions;

- create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances and on the transfer of assets to the Issuer or its restricted subsidiaries;

- sell, lease or transfer certain assets, including stock of restricted subsidiaries;

- issue or sell share capital of certain of our subsidiaries;

- engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

- consolidate or merge with other entities or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the
Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries; and

- impair the security interests benefiting the holders of the Notes.

These limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants.” The covenants to which we are subject could limit our ability to finance_
our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue business opportunities and activities
that may be in our interest.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will require us to comply with certain
financial tests under certain circumstances. Our ability to meet the applicable financial test can be
affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet it. A breach of this
test could result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition,
upon the occurrence of any event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility, subject to
applicable cure periods and other limitations on acceleration or enforcement, the relevant creditors
could cancel the availability of the facilities and elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In
addition, any default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could lead to an event of
default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, including the Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities
of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the
Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could enforce
against any collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. Furthermore, if the New
Revolving Credit Facility was not available to us in full (for example, because we would be unable to
meet the financial covenant in New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement if we drew the New Revolving

##### 58


-----

Credit Facility in full), we may not have sufficient cash to fund our operations, which would have a
material adverse effect on our business.

**_Despite our current indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the Indenture and the New_**
**_Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant_**
**_additional amounts of debt or make certain restricted payments, which could further exacerbate the_**
**_risks associated with our substantial leverage._**

We may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional
indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and
under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with
those restrictions could be substantial. In addition, the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as such
term is defined under those agreements. Moreover, although the Indenture and the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement will contain restrictions on our ability to make restricted payments, including
the declaration and payment of dividends, we will be able to make substantial restricted payments under
certain circumstances. Adding new debt to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels or making
restricted payments could exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage described above,
including our possible inability to service our debt.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations, which_**
**_we may not be able to generate or raise._**

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including
indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and our obligations under the Notes,
and to fund our ongoing operations, will depend on our future performance and ability to generate cash,
which, to a certain extent, is subject to the success of our business strategy as well as general economic,
financial, competitive, legislative, legal, regulatory and other factors, as well as other factors discussed
in these “Risk Factors,” many of which are beyond our control.

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that
currently anticipated revenue growth, cost savings and operating improvements will be realized or that
future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our
debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs, including the repayment at
maturity of the then outstanding amounts under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (if any),
which will mature six months prior to the maturity of the Notes. See “Management’s Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

The commitments in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility can be further increased, assuming
we have the ability to incur such additional debt under the restrictive covenants to be included in the
Indenture. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements” and “Description of the Notes.” At
the maturity of the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, if we do not have sufficient cash flows
from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity
needs, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our
liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

- reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditure;

- sell assets;

- obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

##### 59


-----

- restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes and the New Revolving
Credit Facility, on or before maturity.

The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital-raising
transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay all of our debt.

In the absence of adequate operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems
and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other
obligations. The terms of our debt, including under the Indenture, restrict or will restrict our ability to
transfer or sell assets. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or obtain the funds that
we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from
asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service obligations then due.

Any failure to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes, on a timely basis would likely
result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional
indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture and the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement may limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue
any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require
us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, impacting our
financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets that we could
be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds
realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not
have sufficient cash to meet our obligations.

**_The Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its obligations_**
**_on the Notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets other
than investments in its subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuer depends upon the receipt of sufficient funds
from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations. APCOA intends to provide funds to the Issuer in order to
meet the obligations on the Notes through a combination of dividends and interest payments on
intercompany loans.

If our subsidiaries do not fulfill their obligations under the intercompany loans and do not distribute
cash to the Issuer to make scheduled payments on the Notes, the Issuer will not have any other source
of funds that would allow it to make payments to the holders of the Notes.

Various agreements governing our debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually prohibit, the ability
of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also subject
such payments to further taxation. Applicable law may also limit the amounts that some of our
subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even
prevent such payments. In particular, the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the
Issuer will generally be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to each of them and the
ability to pay their respective debts when due, or the amount of intercompany loans available for
repayment. Certain subsidiaries of the Issuer are organized under German law which provides that
dividends may only be distributed out of current profits and distributable reserves, and, generally,
interim dividend contributions are not allowed under German law. Under German corporate law, a
company may only pay dividends if it has unappropriated retained earnings in its unconsolidated
financial statements prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the
German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - “HGB”). Certain reserves must be established by law
and have to be deducted when calculating the distributable profit. In addition, those subsidiaries of the
Issuer that do not guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the
Notes.

##### 60


-----

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet such group’s obligations,
they may not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their restricted group to
another entity in their restricted group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_The Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at_**
**_floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

A significant portion of our debt, including the Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New
Revolving Credit Facility, will bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to EURIBOR
or LIBOR (or any replacement benchmark) (as the case may be) or, in the case of drawings under the
New Revolving Credit Facility in sterling, a compounded daily rate based on SONIA over the relevant
interest period, as adjusted periodically, plus a margin, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations
in interest rates. Fluctuations in EURIBOR, LIBOR (or any replacement benchmark) or SONIA, or the
occurrence of a “market disruption event” (as will be defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement) may increase our overall interest burden and could have a material adverse effect on our
ability to service our debt obligations. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future,
increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for
capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Neither the Indenture
nor the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or
any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there
can be no assurance that hedging will be available or continue to be available on commercially
reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant
amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent that interest rates or any
drawings were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing
our cash flow.

**_The Use of LIBOR and/or EURIBOR as benchmark may be discontinued in the future_**

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and
law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting
investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of
EURIBOR or LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR.
In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are
deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform,
including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013)
and the European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial
contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016.
Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may
change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be
eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on
March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced the future cessation or loss of
representativeness of the LIBOR benchmark rates (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA
Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be
guaranteed after 2021, in respect of some currencies and tenors, and after certain later dates for other
currencies and tenors. This proposed elimination of the LIBOR benchmark and possible future
announcements in respect of any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any
benchmark or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner
in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and
conditions, or result in other consequences, including the need to adopt a replacement benchmark, in
respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Floating Rate Notes and
drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility). Any such change, as well as manipulative practices
or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR,

##### 61


-----

which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of
interest, including the Floating Rate Notes and drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

Furthermore, the Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if EURIBOR is no longer being
calculated or administered, the Issuer could cause an independent financial advisor to determine an
appropriate rate, which means interest on the Floating Rate Notes would be determined on the basis of
a benchmark rate not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate Notes issued on the
Issue Date.

In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt
(including our New Revolving Credit Facility and the Floating Rate Notes) performing differently than
would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed.

The Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially
subjective judgments (including as to whether EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered
and as to whether any alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for the
purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities) which may
trigger amendments to the Indenture without the consent of the holders of the Notes. The interests of
the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders
of the Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the
involvement of an independent financial institution, the Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not
operate as intended at the relevant time. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the
rate of interest on our floating rate debt (including debt instruments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Floating Rate Notes) will be determined for the relevant period by the
fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**_We may enter into hedging agreements, and such hedging agreements may expose us to credit default_**
**_risks and potential losses if our hedging counterparties fall into bankruptcy._**

A significant portion of our debt, including the Floating Rate Notes and debt instruments under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, will bear interest at floating rates. We may enter in the future into
interest hedging agreements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. Under any such
agreements, we would be exposed to credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our
counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we may have under such swap agreements or other hedging
arrangements may become worthless. Also, such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset
more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from interest rate fluctuations. In addition,
in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate hedging agreements, we may be required
to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.

**_Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, any credit facilities that refinance or replace the_**
**_New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted_**
**_to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture are entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of_**
**_the Collateral sold in any enforcement sale in priority to the Notes. Holders of the Notes will not_**
**_control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured initially on a first-priority basis by the same
Collateral securing the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition,
under the terms of the Indenture, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and
other obligations that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes and,
in certain circumstances, receive proceeds from enforcement of Collateral prior to the Notes. The
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will permit currency and interest rate hedging, certain cash
management obligations and certain other indebtedness incurred in accordance with the Indenture to be
secured on a priority basis.

##### 62


-----

In the event of enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes, pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement, creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, any credit facilities that
refinance or replace the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, certain cash
management obligations and any other indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under
the Indenture will be entitled to be repaid with the proceeds of the Collateral sold in any enforcement
sale in priority to the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Notes
may not be able to recover on the Collateral if the then outstanding claims under Super Senior Liabilities
(as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) are greater
than the proceeds realized. Any proceeds from an enforcement sale of the Collateral will, after all
obligations under Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged from such recoveries, be applied pro
rata in repayment of the Notes and any other obligations secured by the Collateral that are permitted to
rank pari passu and are secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes. As a result, proceeds from the
sale of Collateral in connection with any enforcement action may be insufficient to pay claims under
the Notes. In addition, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure
the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent, who will serve as the Security
Agent for the secured parties with respect to the Collateral, will act only as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Collateral unless otherwise
instructed by the Instructing Group (as defined in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement”) for the purpose of enforcement. See “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security.”_

Creditors of Super Senior Liabilities may have interests that are different from the interests of holders
of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of
the Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells the Collateral as a result of an enforcement action in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the liens over
any other assets of such entities securing such Notes and Note Guarantees may be released. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral
described in this Offering Memorandum, which Collateral also secures the obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and may secure certain hedging obligations and certain cash
management obligations. We may increase the amounts available under the New Revolving Credit
Facility or incur additional Super Senior Liabilities permitted under the Indenture, as a result of which
the amount that will benefit from “super priority” first-priority security interests in the Collateral may
be increased up to the amount permitted under the Indenture. The Collateral may also secure additional
debt ranking pari passu with the Notes to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement. The rights of the holders of the Notes to the Collateral may therefore be diluted
by any increase in the debt secured by first-priority liens on the Collateral.

If there is an event of default on the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only by the
Collateral. There is no guarantee that the value of the Collateral will be sufficient to enable the Issuer
to satisfy its obligations under the Notes. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event
of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than,
amounts due on the Notes.

No appraisal of the fair market value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the
Transactions. The fair market value of the Collateral is based on certain assumptions and may be subject

##### 63


-----

to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, general economic conditions, industry
conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale,
the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, whether
or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral and the fair
market value and condition of the Collateral. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and able
to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the
event of an enforcement action. As a result, the book value of the Collateral should not be conclusively
relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets following the occurrence of an event of default
or enforcement event under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement. All or a portion of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the sale of
the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in our liquidation. In
addition, the value of the Collateral may fluctuate over time and the security granted over the shares of
an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets
owned by the Issuer or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with
respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect
the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, the Trustee or investors as holders of
the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Note Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from
the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and
(if the relevant guarantee has not been released) the Guarantors’ remaining assets. Each of these factors
or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our
creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time. The
existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely
affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to
realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the first priority ranking of security interests with
respect to the Notes can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or re-characterization under the laws of certain
jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests in the Collateral. For example, the enforcement of share
pledges, whether by means of a public auction or a private sale, may be subject to certain specific
requirements and the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third-party to enforce a security
interest. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. We also
cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a
foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon
those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. See “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests” for further information._

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes, or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Notes and the Note Guarantees may create hardening
periods for such security interests, including, for instance, in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Luxembourg

##### 64


-----

(save for financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg Collateral Law) and
Italy. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on
the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, because the Indenture will
permit the release and retaking of security granted in favor of the Notes in certain circumstances,
including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness. The applicable hardening period for
these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted,
perfected or recreated.

Each time, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of
the respective hardening period, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to
enforce it. If the grantor of such security interest were to become subject to a bankruptcy or windingup proceeding after the Issue Date, any mortgage or security interest in the Collateral delivered after
the Issue Date would face a greater risk than security interests in place on the Issue Date of being voided
by the grantor or by its trustee, receiver, liquidator, administrator or similar authority, or otherwise set
aside by a court, as a preference under insolvency law. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest is voided, holders of the Notes would lose the benefit of the security interest. See “Certain
_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note_
_Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The same rights and risks also will apply with respect to future security interests granted in connection
with the accession of further subsidiaries as additional Guarantors and the granting of security interests
over their relevant assets and equity interests for the benefit of holders of the Notes.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_**
**_the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security, as
applicable. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Notes if we fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. In
addition, the Agreed Security Principles allow the Issuer and the Guarantor to retain control over,
operate and collect, invert and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes which with
respect to Collateral located in certain jurisdictions, including Denmark, entail that such Collateral will
not be considered perfected. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights
acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a
certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property
and rights are acquired and identified.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights
in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who
claim a security interest in the same Collateral and some security interests do not actually create the
purported security interest if not properly perfected. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation
by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of
the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taken over the claims the
security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is sometimes
determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest
created on a later date over the same Collateral, but which came into force for third parties earlier (by
way of registration in the appropriate register, by notification or under the general terms and conditions
of banks and financial institutions) may have priority. Neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent has
any obligation or responsibility to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute
collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps or actions to perfect or ensure the perfection of, any
security interest in the Notes against third parties. The failure to create or perfect such additional security
interests may adversely affect the relevant security interest and/or the priority of such security interest
in favor of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to_**
**_the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be_**
**_restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under the Note Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders
of the relevant Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent, which will hold the
Collateral for the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and our hedging obligations, the
holders of the Notes and the holders of any additional debt secured by Collateral permitted to be incurred
under the Indenture. The Indenture will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the
Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes
will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability
_of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” for further information._

**_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale_**
**_of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral
securing the Notes. So long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom,
the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring,
abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments,
including repayments of indebtedness.

With respect to Collateral located in Sweden and Denmark, the above means that security created over
such Collateral is unperfected. To the extent such security remains unperfected, the delay in perfection
creates a clawback risk.

**_There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Note_**
**_Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released
automatically. See “Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees” and “Description of the Notes—
_Security—Release of Liens.” In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of_
any of our subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, then claims under the Notes and the Note Guarantees may be released or transferred. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the
_Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” Your ability to recover on the Notes could be materially impaired_
in such circumstances.

The Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and
retaken in connection with the refinancing of certain indebtedness, including the Notes, if the Issuer has
confirmed in writing to the Security Agent that it has determined that it is neither possible nor desirable
to implement any such refinancing on terms satisfactory to it by instead granting additional Collateral
and/or amending the terms of the existing Collateral. Such a release and retaking of Collateral may give
rise to the start of a new “hardening period” in respect of such Collateral. Under certain circumstances,
other creditors, insolvency administrators or representatives or courts could challenge the validity and
enforceability of the grant of such Collateral. Any such challenge, if successful, could potentially limit
your recovery in respect of such Collateral and thus reduce your recovery under the Notes.

Furthermore, under German law a secured party is, upon request by the relevant security grantor,
obligated to release security if the realizable value of the security is significantly higher than the value
of the obligations secured by such security. Finally, if the secured obligations are discharged,
exchanged, novated or terminated, a pledge or other accessory security interest created pursuant to a
Security Document governed by German law might be released as a matter of German law.

Furthermore, any security created over any Collateral by or pursuant to a Security Document governed
by Swedish law is likely not valid and enforceable under Swedish law to the extent it could be released,
including in connection with a transaction that is permitted, pre-agreed or similar, (including, but not
limited to, any release, amalgamation, merger, consolidation, dissolution, re-designation, disposal,
reorganization or reduction of capital) without the prior written consent (in its sole discretion on a caseby-case basis) of the Security Agent, other than following full discharge of the obligations secured by
the relevant Security Document.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer’s non-Guarantor_**
**_subsidiaries._**

Some, but not all, of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. The Issuer’s subsidiaries
that are Guarantors held 56% of the total unconsolidated assets of the Group (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis)
as of December 31, 2019, and generated 83% of the total unconsolidated net sales revenues and 81% of
the total unconsolidated Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA of the Group for the year ended December 31,
2019, in each case, before intercompany eliminations. In addition, as of March 31, 2021, our
subsidiaries that will not guarantee the Notes had €1.5 million of outstanding third-party debt that would
have ranked structurally senior to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the Notes and
the Note Guarantees. Unless a subsidiary of the Issuer is a Guarantor, such subsidiary will not have any
obligations to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. The
Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur substantial
amounts of additional indebtedness and will not restrict the amount of other liabilities that may be
incurred by these subsidiaries. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, nonGuarantor companies, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of
their claims from the assets of such non-Guarantor companies before these assets are made available
for distribution to the Issuer or any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-Guarantor company becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

- the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) and the Guarantors will have no
right to proceed against the assets of such company; and

- the creditors of such non-Guarantor company, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such company before
any Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions
from such subsidiary.

As such, the Notes and each Note Guarantee will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including
trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries.

**_The insolvency laws of certain jurisdictions may provide you with less protection than U.S._**
**_bankruptcy law and enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Note Guarantees or_**
**_in the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany and the Guarantors and security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, Italy, Luxembourg,
Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Any insolvency proceedings by or against the Issuer or
Guarantors incorporated or organized in jurisdictions outside of the United States would likely be based
on the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant entity or its “centre of main

-----

interests” (including EU insolvency laws) and not of the United States. In the event the Issuer or any of
the other Guarantors experience financial difficulty, we cannot predict as to which jurisdiction or
jurisdictions may commence insolvency or similar proceedings, or the outcome of such proceedings.
Any enforcement of the Note Guarantees of the Notes after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such
other jurisdictions will be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of
incorporation or other jurisdictions, including the jurisdiction of its “centre of main interests.” The
insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may not be as favorable to your interests as
creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The
insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict
with, each other, including in the areas of rights of secured and other creditors, the ability to void
preferential transfer, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest
and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call
into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply and may adversely affect your
ability to enforce your rights under the Note Guarantees in these jurisdictions and limit any amounts
that you may receive. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

Security interests to secure the Notes and Note Guarantees will be granted in collateral located in certain
of these jurisdictions. In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions or in the jurisdiction of organization of a future Guarantor. Your
rights under the Notes, the security granted in respect of the Notes and guarantees of the Notes will
therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to enforce effectively
your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multijurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. The consequences of the multiple
jurisdictions involved in the Transactions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should
apply which could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full
under the Notes and the Note Guarantees. In addition, certain jurisdictions may impose limitations on
the ability of foreign creditors to enforce security interests, including, for example, requiring registration
or approval under foreign ownership regulations. The laws of certain of the jurisdictions in which the
Guarantors are incorporated or organized further limit the ability of these subsidiaries to guarantee debt
of, or provide security for, other companies.

See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note
_Guarantees and the Security Interests” for a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in_
Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden and the
Netherlands.

**_Each Note Guarantee and security may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_**
**_limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Note Guarantee provides the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant
Guarantor. However, the Indenture will provide that each Note Guarantee will be limited to the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without rendering the relevant Note
Guarantee, as it relates to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable
law, and enforcement of each Note Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses.
In addition, the Indenture will provide for further limitations in accordance with the specific legal
requirements in each Guarantor jurisdiction. For example, the Note Guarantees and security interests to
be granted by each Italian Guarantor will only guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under
Tranche B (as defined herein) of the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and Security Interests.” The same_
limitations may apply to security interests (other than the Note Guarantees) that will be provided by the
Guarantors in certain jurisdictions.

##### 68


-----

Enforcement of any of the Note Guarantees or security against any Guarantor will be subject to certain
defenses and limitations available to Guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. These laws and defenses
generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, the preservation of share
capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws, defenses and limitations are applicable, a
Guarantor may have no liability or decreased liability under its Note Guarantee or other security
depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability
of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of any
Note Guarantee against any Guarantor.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and
other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its
Note Guarantee, direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Note Guarantee to
the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (ii) take other action
that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found, among other things, that:

- the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest in the Collateral was incurred with actual intent
to give preference to one creditor over another, to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or
shareholders of the Guarantor; or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Note
Guarantees has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that
the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest;

- the Guarantor or security provider did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent
value or corporate benefit for the relevant Note Guarantee and the Guarantor: (i) was insolvent
or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Note Guarantee or security interest; (ii) was
undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Note Guarantee; or (iii)
intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at
maturity;

- the relevant Note Guarantee and/or Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate
objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the
Guarantor;

- the amount paid or payable under the relevant Note Guarantee was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law; or

- the grant of the Note Guarantee or security is, having regard to the risk accepted by the holders
of the Notes, on terms which are, or were, such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be
made (whether conditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the subscription for the
Notes or otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future Note Guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries
pursuant to the Indenture or other securities pursuant to the Security Documents.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was
“insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not
determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless
of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Note Guarantee was issued, that payments
to holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds.
The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable
governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred
indebtedness: the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its
assets; the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable
liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or it
cannot pay its debts as they become due.

##### 69


-----

The liability of each Guarantor under its Note Guarantee or other security will be limited to the amount
that will result in such Note Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper
corporate distribution, or otherwise being set aside or found to be in violation of the applicable statutory
requirements in each such jurisdiction. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court
will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor, or the effectiveness
of limitation language. It is possible that the entire Note Guarantee or other security may be set aside,
in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Note Guarantee was a
preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Note Guarantee, or held it unenforceable
for any other reason, you may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would
be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Note
Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Note Guarantee is invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Note Guarantee
obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable
Guarantor, and if we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes or any Note Guarantee is found to
be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance, or is otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that
we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes.

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control_**
**_and the occurrence of certain important corporate events will not constitute a Change of Control._**

The Indenture will contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “Change of Control” (as
defined in “Description of the Notes”). Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, we will be required
to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a Change of
Control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time,
or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the
outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow
us to make such required repurchases. A Change of Control may trigger a mandatory prepayment of
amounts outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other indebtedness even
if such event is deemed not to be a change of control under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes
pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the Change of Control
itself does not. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to
the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control, may be limited by our thenexisting financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required
repurchases. If an event constituting a Change of Control were to occur at a time when we are prohibited
from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent
of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained,
the Issuer would remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control. We
cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to
purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a
default under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control.”

The Change of Control provision that will be contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you
protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring,
merger or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate
events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not
constitute a Change of Control as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of
_the Notes—Change of Control,” the Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuer_
to offer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger,
recapitalization or similar transaction.

##### 70


-----

Moreover, as a matter of German law, with regard to any Change of Control triggered by measures
taken in respect of the Issuer for the purpose of a debt/equity-swap as part of an insolvency plan
proceeding (Insolvenzplanverfahren) or a restructuring plan proceeding
(Restrukturierungsplanverfahren) under German law, the Change of Control provision could be deemed
void and we would not be required to offer the repurchase of the outstanding Notes.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a Change of Control will
be deemed not to be a Change of Control if a certain net consolidated leverage ratio calculated in
accordance with the “Description of the Notes” is not exceeded in connection with such an event. In
this case, holders of Notes would not be entitled to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes and
would only be able to rely on the then prevailing trading prices in order to exit their investments, which
might be lower than the 101% change of control repurchase price. See “Description of the Notes—
_Change of Control” and “Description of the Notes—Certain Definitions—Change of Control Triggering_
_Event.”_

The definition of Change of Control in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries (if any), taken as a whole, to certain persons.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no
precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances,
there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition
of “all or substantially all” of the Issuer’s assets and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of_**
**_the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Owners of the book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of relevant Notes unless
and until definitive notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests. Instead, the common
depositary (or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Notes
in global form.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form
will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter,
such payments will be credited to Euroclear and Clearstream participants’ accounts that hold bookentry interests in the Notes in global form and credited by such participants to indirect participants.
After payment to Euroclear and Clearstream, none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility
or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments of interest, principal or other amounts
to Euroclear and Clearstream, or to owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a bookentry interest in the Notes, you must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and, if you
are not a participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which
you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Notes under the
Indenture.

Owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon our solicitations for consents
or requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes, including the enforcement of security
for the Notes and the Note Guarantees. Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted
to act directly only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and
Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented
for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions or to
take any other action on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture, unless and until the relevant
Definitive Registered Notes (as defined in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”) are issued in respect of

##### 71


-----

all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through
Euroclear and Clearstream. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through
Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

- the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

- your ability to sell your Notes; or

- the price at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial
volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes
may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to
disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for
the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there can be no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made to the Authority for the listing of and permission to deal in the
Notes on the Official List of the Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or remain listed.
Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to the
Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Notes from the Official List of the
Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indenture will allow us to issue additional Notes in the future, which could adversely
impact the liquidity of the relevant series of Notes.

**_United States civil liabilities may not be enforceable against us._**

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Germany, and the Guarantors and security providers are
incorporated under the laws of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, England, Italy, Luxembourg,
Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. In addition, all members of our management board and our
officers reside outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to effect service of
process within the United States upon us or such other persons residing outside the United States, or to
enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against such persons in United States courts in
any action. In addition, it may be difficult for investors to enforce, in original actions brought in courts
in jurisdictions located outside the United States, including those of the Guarantors, rights predicated
upon United States laws. See “Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

Recovery in civil proceedings, ability to effect service of process and the recognition and enforceability
of judgments against Guarantors organized in jurisdictions are also subject to qualifications and local
applicable law. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” on the various relevant jurisdictions_
of the Issuer and Guarantors.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in
determining the likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating
agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating
agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal
at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies
may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings, could adversely affect the value
and trading of the Notes and have an adverse impact on our cost of capital in our local business and our
ability to secure local financing or win additional contracts.

**_The transferability of the Notes may be limited under applicable securities laws._**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act
or the securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered
or sold in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to,
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and the applicable securities laws of any state or any
other jurisdiction. The Notes are not being offered for sale in the United States except to QIBs in
accordance with Rule 144A. We have not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register the Notes with
the SEC (including by way of an exchange offer). See “Transfer Restrictions.” It is the obligation of
holders of the Notes to ensure that their offers and sales of the Notes within the United States and other
countries comply with applicable securities laws.

**_The Sponsor may have interests that do not align with yours._**

The Sponsor has the power to control our affairs and policies. The Sponsor also controls, to a large
degree, the election of directors, the appointment of management and the entry into mergers, sales of
substantially all of our assets, the payment of cash dividends and other extraordinary transactions. The
directors so elected will have authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness (including the Notes),
to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other
decisions. The interests of the Sponsor could conflict with your interests. For example, if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our indebtedness as it matures, the interests of the Sponsor
and certain of its affiliates as equity holders might conflict with your interests as a holder of the Notes.
The Sponsor may also have an interest in pursuing dividend payments, acquisitions, divestitures,
financings or other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though
such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes or decrease the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes. Additionally, the Sponsor is in the business of making investments in
companies, and may from time to time acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete
with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or clients of ours. For more information, see “Our
_Shareholder” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”_

**_You may face foreign currency exchange risks as a result of investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If you are a U.S. investor, an investment in the
Notes will entail foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes
in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar because of economic, political and other factors over
which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar could cause a decrease in
the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to you on a
U.S. dollar basis.

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

If the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds their issue price by an amount equal to or greater
than a statutorily defined de minimis amount, then the Notes will be considered to be issued with original
issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Notes are issued with OID, then, in
addition to the stated interest on the Notes, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally
will be required to include the OID on such Note in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on
a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in advance of the receipt of the
cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S.
_Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.” Prospective investors should consult_
with their tax advisors regarding the application of such rules to the Notes.

**_Upon an IPO Debt Pushdown, material Collateral and Note Guarantees may be released, any retaken_**
**_Collateral may be subject to hardening periods, and holders of the Notes may have adverse tax_**
**_consequences._**

Under certain circumstances, we may undertake the transactions described in “Description of Certain
_Financing_ _Arrangements—Intercreditor_ _Agreement—Provisions_ _Following_ _an IPO” (such_
transactions, an “IPO Debt Pushdown”), pursuant to which the Issuers are entitled to give notice that
will automatically operate so that, among other things, the references in the Indentures and any
Intercreditor Agreement to such Issuer and Restricted Subsidiaries shall apply only to the IPO
Pushdown Entity and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In such event, each holding or parent company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity would be released from its obligations under the applicable Debt Documents,
which would include the release of Note Guarantees and Collateral provided by such entities. There are
no restrictions on the transfer of assets to such entities, and any such release may materially reduce the
Collateral securing the Notes. Moreover, we may elect to, but are not under any obligation to, revoke
or otherwise reverse an IPO Debt Pushdown undertaken in anticipation of an initial public offering, or
to replace any Note Guarantees or Collateral released pursuant thereto, in the event such initial public
offering is not consummated. To the extent that new security documents in respect of any Collateral to
be retaken (including a pledge over the shares of the Issuer) are entered into, such Collateral may be
subject to new hardening periods. In addition, such modifications to the terms of the Notes could be
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a deemed exchange of (i) the Notes as in place prior to
such modifications for (ii) new Notes as in place after such modifications. If such modifications result
in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such deemed exchange generally would be
treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which beneficial owners of the
Notes would be required to recognize any gain or loss. Furthermore, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the new Notes deemed issued in such a deemed exchange could be treated as issued with
original issue discount. In such event, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation would be required
to include the original issue discount in their income as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash
corresponding to such income. In addition, the determination of whether the deemed new Notes are
treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” as a result of the possibility of additional payments,
as further described above under “ —Additional Payments,” would be made at the time of the
modification. Holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation should consult their own tax advisors as
to the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to potential modifications of the Notes in
connection with the IPO Debt Pushdown. It is also possible that the IPO Debt Pushdown could result
in a taxable event for tax purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Interest paid on a Note paid to a resident of a “non-cooperative jurisdiction” after December 31,_**
**_2021 may be subject to a new German withholding tax, and the Issuer will not be obligated to pay_**
**_any additional amounts in respect of any such withholding._**

Germany recently enacted a new withholding tax at a rate of 15.825% on interest paid by a payor that
is tax resident in Germany to a payee that is tax resident in a “non-cooperative jurisdiction” listed in a
decree to be published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance. The list of non-cooperative

jurisdictions, which is expected to be based on the European Union’s list of non-cooperative
jurisdictions and may be amended from time to time, is currently expected to include: American Samoa,
Anguilla, Dominica, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Vanuatu. The new withholding tax is expected to apply to interest paid after
December 31, 2021 or, in the case of jurisdictions that were added to the European Union’s list of noncooperative jurisdictions after December 31, 2020, to interest paid after December 31, 2022.

If the foregoing withholding tax applies to any amounts payable to a holder of Notes, the Issuer will not
be obligated to pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding.

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the new German withholding tax.

**Overview**

We are a leading parking infrastructure operator and services provider in the European market, with a
large and diversified portfolio of leased and managed parking facilities across 13 European countries.
We operate off-street parking facilities under leases from private and public landlords, and also operate
on- and off-street parking facilities for clients under management contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we
operated approximately 11,700 parking facilities with over 1.6 million parking spaces. We believe we
are either the leading or number two parking facility operator by number of parking spaces in each of
our ten largest country markets.

We benefit from a large, structurally attractive and growing parking market that we believe will benefit
from ongoing outsourcing, mobility and other industry trends such as growth in the number of vehicles
in Europe, urban areas, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, car hiring and sharing and more recently use
of the car parks as infrastructure for the e-commerce value chain and customer delivery. During 2018,
the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues of which
approximately €11 to 12 billion was spent on outsourcing parking management. We believe we are well
positioned to capture the benefits from these trends and the general economic recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic expected in 2021 and 2022 because we create significant, stable and recurring
value for our clients, for whom parking facilities are often a non-core operation, by providing a large
scale platform that is focused on driving higher revenues by increasing volume, pricing and utilization,
at a lower cost of operation.

##### 78


-----

Our operations benefit from a diverse portfolio of lease and management contracts as well as
geographical, business sector and customer diversification, which made our business more resilient
during the COVID-19 pandemic, while at the same time allowing us to leverage operational similarities
to benefit from scale economies. Our parking facilities are spread across most of Europe (with certain
clusters for operational efficiency) and apart from one large market (Germany), five other countries
(Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway) each contributed approximately 10% of
our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We operate in a wide
range of business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and
hospitality, and parking enforcement, with limited correlation between them. Furthermore, many of our
parking facilities are not dedicated to a single institution, business or purpose but are instead multifunctional and used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether it is for work, shopping,
restaurant or cultural activities, or other purposes. We have very low contract concentration, with over
5,900 contracts across over 11,700 parking facilities.

**Our Sectors and Geographies**

**_Our Sectors_**

We are a leading, pan-European provider of parking management services, parking enforcement
services and ancillary services across all parking sectors. Our parking sectors include (i) City &
Shopping, (ii) Travel, (iii) Healthcare & Education, (iv) Events & Hospitality and (v) Parking
Enforcement, which include our Park & Control (PAC), Park & Guard and “On-Street” parking
enforcement services.

The following table provides overview of our revenue by sector for the periods indicated:

**Total ........................................................** **666.0** **720.6** **531.9** **163.9** **112.4** **480.5**

_City & Shopping_

Our City & Shopping sector has historically been our largest sector in terms of revenue. Within the City
& Shopping sector, our operations include a mixture of lease contracts and management contracts with
clients including municipalities, investors and owners and operators of city centre parking facilities
which are generally visited by consumers for a variety of purposes such as offices, other places of work,
leisure and recreational locations. Short-term parking, including for work, shopping, cultural activities
or other purposes, contributes the majority of revenue by fee type with approximately 65% on average.
Our operations in this sector benefit from ongoing urbanization across Europe as well as the continuing
increase in population mobility, which have historically led to increased vehicle numbers within urban
environments. Our growth in this sector is partially offset by the expanding use of public transportation
as well as the growing popularity of e-commerce, all of which reduces footfall in inner cities. In
addition, we also operate a number of facilities related to either in-town or out-of-town shopping centers
under a mixture of both lease and management contracts. Growth in this sector is generally through a
combination of pricing and through utilizing technology to reduce the costs of operating these facilities
(e.g., through the introduction of ANPR technology).

##### 79


-----

Our results of operations in the City & Shopping sector were significantly affected as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the implementation of nationwide lockdowns, increased home
working and the closure of non-essential shops across Europe. Given the quick and almost instant
recovery of the City & Shopping sector upon lifting of lockdown measures during 2020, we expect our
operation in this sector to gradually return to the levels seen before the pandemic as the vaccine roll-out
accelerates and restrictions on social contact are eased across Europe and, particularly in the initial
periods of the recovery, where we expect some consumers switch to using private rather than public
transport.

_Travel_

The Travel sector is our second-largest sector in terms of revenue. Our operations in the Travel sector
include a mixture of lease contracts and management contracts. In the latter, we receive management
fees independently of parking volumes at the underlying parking facility, across a number of segments
of the travel market including airports, train stations and park & ride facilities. Our financial
performance in this sector has historically been partly driven by positive passenger volume trends in
European air travel, which increased by 30% between 2014 and 2019, as well as by increasing
disposable income, which has resulted in an increase in holiday travel. While our performance in the
Travel sector in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, was
significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a year-on-year decrease in air passenger
numbers across the European Union by 70%, passenger volumes are forecast to recover to their preCOVID-19 pandemic levels by 2024. Despite the volume impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our
Contract Contribution decreased only by 39% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2019 due to a combination of our mix of contract types and operations across
different segments of the Travel sector as well as support from our clients. A number of our clients in
this sector waived any guaranteed minimum rents in our airport lease contracts (thereby making them
fully variable rents and thus providing downside protection in the face of reduced travel volumes
throughout the pandemic) and, in a number of locations, our landlords agreed to temporarily reduce the
variable rent percentages.

_Healthcare & Education_

Our operations in the Healthcare & Education sector have historically benefitted from the ongoing
outsourcing of parking management and parking enforcement services by public and private hospital
operators and universities. Our clients in the Healthcare & Education sector include public and private
hospitals as well as universities. Many clients in this sector consider parking to be important as both a
service to offer their visitors in addition to a revenue generator for them. As such, we operate a mixture
of both lease and management contracts, depending on the client’s requirements and our view of the
risk profile of a contract. The healthcare sites are usually characterized by limited available spaces with
different publics to be served: staff, patients and visitors. The efficient management of these customers
flows increasingly requires digital technology. Similarly, in the Education sector there is a mix of
teaching and other staff, students and visitors, again with limited spaces that require careful
management. Particularly in the Healthcare sector we increasingly help the hospitals to expand parking
capacity by planning and coordinating the building of new facilities which we then manage through
contracts with a duration of over 15 years. The Healthcare & Education sector were comparatively less
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as hospitals and other healthcare facilities remained opened
throughout the year and continued to benefit from high utilization of parking facilities by, for example,
hospital staff.

_Events and Hospitality_

The Events & Hospitality sector primarily encompasses parking facilities at exhibitions, events
(including sports and cultural venues) and hotels, with both lease and management contracts. Our lease
revenue in particular in this sector will be dependent on the number of events held at these locations or
the number of visitors. Since parking revenues in this sector are highly dependent on the number of

##### 80


-----

events held or visitors to these locations, our contract and rent structures reflect the characteristics of
each location. We usually provide the following services: site-specific ad hoc resources, organize the
car flow, provide the parking equipment and focus on driving revenue which is increasingly pre-booked.
In the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020, our performance in
the Events and Hospitality sector was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to
the cancellation of mass events and the temporary closure of trade fairs and entertainment venues and
significantly reduced occupancy at hotels.

_Parking Enforcement Services_

Parking enforcement services sales revenue comprises control fees and revenue generated from
enforcement of parking on behalf of the owner or landlord of the parking facilities. This is generally
generated by our parking attendants issuing the control fees to owners of vehicles who have parked in
contravention of the parking regulations at the site, or through the use of technology such as ANPR
cameras. See “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Fee Type—Control Fees.”

**_Our Main Geographies_**

We operate our business on a pan-European scale in 13 countries.

The following table provides an overview of our Contract Contribution in our main geographies for the
periods indicated:

All countries are internally measured by their ability to win new business, retain existing contracts, site
price and utilization optimization and deliver continuous improvements on cost optimization. The level
of revenue generation and Contract Contribution from any given country also depends on the sector
split in the relevant country as well as the split between revenue types and the mix of lease and
management contracts.

_Germany_

Germany is our largest market and has a comparatively larger share of lease contracts compared to our
other markets. Growth in this market is primarily driven by increased outsourcing of parking
management (i.e. first time letting of lease or management contracts) and parking enforcement services,
in addition to overall macro drivers around the mobility sector. In addition, we believe that the relatively
low digital penetration of the parking industry in Germany provides us with considerable growth
potential as our electronic payment and consumer engagement solutions gain increased usage.

_United Kingdom_

Growth in our operations in the United Kingdom is mainly driven by increased market share and
increased outsourcing of parking management and enforcement services by both public and private
sector organizations, who are the owner or landlords of the parking facilities that we service. The Travel
sector (primarily covering airports and rail segments) is our largest sector in the United Kingdom, which
accounted for 38% of revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our operations in the United
Kingdom benefit from a high share of management contracts, accounting for 81% of our total revenue
in the United Kingdom in the year ended December 31, 2019, which has historically led to stable and
predictable Contract Contribution generation. In addition, our operations in the United Kingdom benefit
from an increased roll-out of digital parking technology, which provides us with the opportunity to
access new, high-margin income streams (such as ANPR technology, which has lower associated
operating costs than traditional manned patrols or barrier operations).

_Italy_

Growth in our operations in Italy is primarily driven by increased outsourcing of parking management
and parking enforcement services. In addition, the Italian market for parking management services and
parking enforcement services is highly fragmented, which provides us with attractive consolidation
opportunities. Our operations in Italy predominately comprise lease contracts, including one long-term
contract which requires us to build the underlying car park.

_Norway_

The parking management services and parking enforcement services market in Norway is characterized
by significant outsourcing activities across all sectors other than on-street parking management,
decreasing inner-city on-street parking capacity and a high digital and cashless penetration. Travel is
the largest sector by revenue in Norway, and we operate the parking facilities at most of the public and
privately owned airports in the country, currently with the exception of Oslo airport. Our operations in
the Norwegian Travel sector are generally characterized by high revenue and high rent shares resulting
in comparatively lower Contract Contribution margins compared to other sectors.

by significant outsourcing activities across most sectors, a lack of free inner-city on-street parking
capacity and a high digital and cashless penetration. In addition, our operations in Sweden benefit from
an increased roll-out of digital parking technology, which provides us with the opportunity to access
new, high-margin income streams.

local investors, and is characterized by high levels of digital and cashless penetration. Our operations
in Denmark benefit from largely variable rent payments and low capital expenditures as landlords
typically fund a higher proportion of capital expenditure than in other countries.

**COVID-19 Impact on Our Business**

Our results of operation in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and the year ended December 31,
2020 have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, total revenue declined across all fee
types by a total of 26.2%. However, the decline was mainly driven by a reduction of short-term parking
revenue (53% of total revenue 2019) by 42.0%, while revenue from all other fee types in aggregate
decreased by only 8.2%. See “—Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Fee Type.”

Following an approximately 16.1% increase in revenue and an 11.1% increase in Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted
EBITDA in the two months ended February 28, 2020 compared to the prior-year period, revenue
generation and Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA declined sharply, by approximately 44% and 173%,
respectively, in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of the strict lockdown measures imposed by
governments across Europe to slow the spread of COVID-19. The imposition of lockdown measures
had most severe impact on our operations during the period from March to May 2020, when short-term
parking revenues were significantly reduced, as consumers worked from home and were only allowed
or advised to go out for essential or narrowly-defined permitted purposes.

With the easing of lockdown measures across our jurisdictions of operation towards the end of the
second quarter of 2020, consumers almost instantly started to utilize our parking facilities again, which
resulted in a strong recovery of our short-term parking revenues and operating cash flows, which
continued through the end of the summer of 2020. Even with short-term parking revenue in the third
quarter of 2020 continuing to be negatively affected by the absence of mass events, the closure of
hospitality and entertainment venues, nationwide working from home policies and continued
restrictions on travel, we estimate that across all of our jurisdictions of operations our revenue for the
third quarter ended September 30, 2020 reached approximately 76% of our revenue generated during
the third quarter ended September 30, 2019.

The resurgence of the virus in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the corresponding imposition of further
lockdown measures led to a renewed significant decrease in short-term parking revenues. At the same
time, our contract parking revenue increased by 5.5% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared
to the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our management contracts remained relatively less
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with our revenue from management contracts for the year ended
December 31, 2020 amounting to €155.6 million compared to €173.5 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019.

Our management reacted quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic and established a cross-functional
COVID-19 response team, which focuses on safeguarding the health and safety of our employees and
consumers and limiting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. In particular, in March
2020, management implemented strict cash management controls, including (i) a bottom-up, 17-week
rolling cashflow forecast and (ii) the deferral of non-essential capital expenditures, which resulted in a
reduction of our non-new business capital expenditures to €17.7 million (compared to €22.5 million in
the year ended December 2019). These cash management controls resulted in reductions in total capital
expenditures (excluding finance leases) in 2020 compared to the original budget for that year of €10.3
million, of which €9.9 million was deferred to 2021. In addition, we implemented stringent operational
and overhead cost reduction measures, including an immediate freeze on all temporary and new hiring,
a reduction in headcount of 736 employees, particularly in our parking attendant and airport staff
numbers, and furloughing approximately 20% of our non-directly revenue generating operational and
overhead staff. Furthermore, we leveraged government programs, such as flexi-time and furlough
arrangements and fixed cost recovery support schemes, in order to further reduce our cost base. These
measures resulted in cost reductions compared to the original 2020 budget of approximately €44
million, or 17% of our total non-rent costs, in the period March 1 to December 31, 2020.

##### 85


-----

In March 2020, we initiated a rent waiver and deferral program across our entire business, which
included the re-negotiation of lease contracts with the aim to defer rent payments and temporarily reduce
or move fixed rent structures to variable rent structures. In addition, we invoked existing contractual
protection clauses, such as clauses allowing rent adjustments in the case of an under-utilization of
parking facilities, to further reduce our rent payments. These rent reduction measures, coupled with the
benefit of reduced variable rent costs due to lower revenues, resulted in rent savings of approximately
€125 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the original budget for that year.

In May and June 2020, we also raised additional liquidity in an aggregate amount net of costs of €68
million in the form of an additional term loan facility. Furthermore, in May 2020, our shareholders,
Centerbridge and SVP Global provided us with an equity injection in the amount of €40 million.

In addition to implementing measures to safeguard our business, we also continued to focus on
providing consumers of our parking facilities with the best possible customer service given the
circumstances, including by keeping our parking facilities open as much as possible as people were
advised to avoid public transportation, decreasing physical contact points by enabling and promoting
digital payment and contactless and cashless parking solutions and leveraging our online pre-booking
tools. These efforts resulted in high retention rate of 98% in line with previous years and new business
equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution during 2020, which we
expect will contribute significantly to our portfolio growth going forward.

While our business has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the past fifteen months
also showed that as soon as restrictions are eased, people quickly start to return to our facilities,
corresponding to a direct recovery in revenues. Our liquidity position remains stable and we believe
that the continued roll-out of vaccination programs across our markets will contribute to the acceleration
of our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Key Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Demand for Parking Services_**

Our revenues and profitability are affected by industry-wide megatrends which drive demand for our
parking services.

Growth in the European parking industry is driven by increasing urbanization across Europe, as well as
an increased mobility of urban populations, with cars historically accounting for more than 80% of
passenger transport in the European Union. These trends have led to a significant growth of the overall
vehicle fleet in Europe, which has increased by between 12 and 15 million vehicles per year between
2013 and 2019, and stood at over 240 million vehicles at the end of 2019. While this growth trend was
reversed in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, when new car registrations in Europe decreased
by approximately 24%, the total number of vehicles in Europe remained relatively stable. At the same
time, traffic volumes and, in turn, demand for parking services are negatively affected by increased
consumer reliance on car sharing and taxi services, such as Uber, which provide alternatives to private
vehicle usage. In addition, cities and municipalities are expanding their public transportation networks
as they seek to control the flow of traffic through their town and city centers, which may result in
reduced car traffic. Furthermore, increased regulation of the car industry, such as the phase-out of
combustion engines across Europe as well as road user charges, such as London’s congestion charge
and Oslo’s road tolls, can lead to a reduction in the level of traffic, as well as stagnating demand for
parking spaces.

**_Type of Contract_**

We provide parking management services and parking enforcement services through a combination of
lease contracts and management contracts.

##### 86


-----

_Lease Contracts_

Lease contracts are medium-term contracts with a typical initial duration of ten to fifteen years, with an
option to extend for another five to ten years mostly at our sole discretion. Under our lease contracts,
we are typical responsible for running the parking operations at the relevant parking facility. In turn,
we receive parking fees directly from the consumer using the parking facility and pay rent to the lessor
or owner of the underlying asset. Rent payments under our lease contracts are usually in a combination
of fixed rent payments, which accounted for 42% of rent payments in the year ended December 31,
2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), and variable rent payments that are linked to, for example, the amount
of parking fees collected. In addition, under our lease contracts, we are typically responsible for all
operating expenses of the relevant parking facility, such as personnel expenses, cost of materials and
other operating expenses as well as all capital expenditure for parking equipment. We often have full
pricing autonomy under our lease contracts, except at locations where the landlord wishes to retain
authority for parking tariffs such as airports and shopping centers.

In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2021,
lease contracts accounted for 76%, 76%, 71% and 69%, respectively, of our total revenue . Furthermore,
in the year ended December 31, 2019, lease contracts accounted for 96% of revenue in Denmark, 83%
in Sweden, 97% in Norway, 84% in Italy, 84% in Germany and 19% in the United Kingdom.

As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,000 sites under lease agreements.

_Management Contracts_

Management contracts have a typical duration of three to eight years. Under our management contracts,
we receive fees from the site owner or lessor to cover our costs for running a site in addition to a fee for
managing the site. We can also generate revenue from equipment sales to our clients. The management
fees that we receive under our management contracts is typically adjusted on an annual basis based on
the consumer price index or other benchmark indices. We do not pay rent to our customers under our
management contracts but remain responsible for covering the underlying parking facility’s operating
expenses, such as personnel expenses, cost of materials and other operating expenses. Parking tariff
control and other strategic decisions related to the underlying parking facility remain with the owner or
lessor. As a result, we are not exposed to risk of fluctuating parking volume and instead focus our
activities on optimizing our operational performance.

Management contracts generally have lower margins than lease contracts as we are not exposed to any
revenue risk. However, our margins earned from management contracts are a function of a markup on
our operational costs, rather than consumer revenue less rent less operational costs for lease contracts,
and as a result on a percentage basis, management contract margins are not directly comparable to those
for lease contracts. Total management contract revenue includes that shown as ‘management
agreements’ in the fee type analysis, in addition to part of ‘other services’ which relates to charge-on of
costs to management contract clients. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021, management contracts accounted for 24%, 24%, 29% and 31%,
respectively, of our total revenue. Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, management
contracts accounted for 4% of revenue in Denmark, 17% in Sweden, 3% in Norway, 16% in Italy, 16%
in Germany and 81% in the United Kingdom.

As of March 31, 2021, we had approximately 4,700 sites under lease agreements.

**_Pricing_**

Our results of operations are impacted by the pricing of parking tariffs at our parking facilities.

We generally determine parking fees based on supply and demand at individual parking locations. In
addition, we set parking tariffs with reference to the local competitive environment for alternative
locations in the immediate vicinity of our parking facilities. The level of pricing for our parking tariffs

##### 87


-----

typically also depends on the parking fee type, with rates for short-term parking generally being higher
than rates for long-term parking. Furthermore, the parking fees are impacted by regulation: regulation
affects the level of supply, through controlling new developments, the pricing of on-street parking, and
the amount of available free parking. Lastly, regulations affect the demand for our parking facilities
through policies that discourage vehicle traffic, such as congestion charges and other urban planning
measures, and the promotion of mass transit alternatives.

We continue to optimize our pricing structure through the roll-out of our data-driven dynamic pricing
model, which allows us to adjust our parking tariffs based on the location of a parking facility, the time
and day, demand at a particular parking facility and the duration of stay.

**_Fee Type_**

Our results of operations are affected by the type of parking fee charged. Our parking fees include (i)
short-term parking fees, (ii) fees from management agreements, (iii) contract parking fees and (iv) fees
from off-street parking facility monitoring.

The following table provides a breakdown of sales revenue according to fee type for the periods
indicated:

**Three months ended**

**Year ended December 31,** **March 31,**

**(in € million)** **2018** **2019** **2020** **2020** **2021**
Short-term parking............................................................ 356.2 383.1 222.1 78.4 36.4

**666.0** **720.6** **531.9** **163.9** **112.4**
**Total .................................................................................**

(1) Primarily relates to refunds or cancellations of control fees.

Revenue for leased sites is comprised of a mix of short-term parking fees, contract parking fees and
control fees, although we do not always generate all types of fees from every site. For leased sites, our
revenue is generally related to the volume of consumers using these sites. In addition, we are usually
also responsible for collecting the consumer revenue at leased sites. To minimize our revenue collection
risk, we collect most of the short-term parking and contract parking fees at our leased sites either in
advance or at the point of utilization of the parking site.

Revenue for management sites is comprised of management fees, which are intended to cover both our
costs incurred in operating a site for a client and our fees for performing the management services.
Management fees are either fixed in total, which allows us to increase site profitability through cost
savings, or on an actual cost recovery basis, which results in cost saving programs benefitting the client,
plus a fixed management element.

In addition to our traditional fee types, we are seeing increasing demand for utilization of our parking
facilities as Urban Hubs. We consider income from our Urban Hubs to be incremental to income
generated from parking consumers as our Urban Hubs typically either utilize spare capacity at sites or
at times of the day when occupancy levels are generally lower, resulting in only limited overlap with
our other revenue streams. We plan to separately report revenue from our Urban Hubs once it becomes
material to the overall group.

##### 88


-----

_Short-Term Parking Fees_

Short-term parking fees are generated from shorter term parking customers, such as per-hour or per-day
tickets, under our lease contracts. We collect short-term parking fees directly from the short-term
parking customers in the form of cash or by debit or credit cards at the gates and physical barriers
present in our parking facilities. Short-term parking is typically charged at higher rates than long-term
parking, resulting in higher profitability per hour as compared to long-term parking. At the same time,
short-term parking exposes us to risks of lower level of parking facility utilization and, as a result,
greater volatility in revenue generation.

_Management Fees_

Management fees comprise fixed and variable fees generated under our management contracts with
third parties, including public authorities and private landlords and can be across all the main sectors in
which we operate. The level of management fees for a particular asset is typically agreed for the duration
of the management contract and is typically adjusted on an annual basis based on the consumer price
index as well as other benchmark indices, such as the London Living Wage. Given their relatively fixed
nature, management fees provide us with revenue stability and visibility over the duration of the
management contract.

_Contract Parking Fees_

Contract parking fees describe fees generated from customers holding season tickets, including
monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets, under our lease contracts. Contract parking fees are fixed
for the duration of the agreement with the consumer and are typically subject to annual price escalations
and collected in advance of the period to which they relate. As a result, contract parking fees have
historically provided us with greater revenue stability compared to short-term parking fees.

_Parking Enforcement Services Fees_

The type of fees received under our parking enforcement services vary depending on whether our
contract is with private landlords (in the case of Parking Control (“PAC”) or Park & Guard services) or
with municipalities (in the case of “On-Street” services).

Under contracts with private landlords, we generate control fees which comprise revenue generated
from enforcement of parking on behalf of the owner or landlord of the parking facilities. Under these
contracts, we patrol privately-owned parking spaces and issue and collect parking control fees directly
from the consumer. We subsequently may pay a portion of the fees collected to the site landlord under
our lease agreements based on the level of fees collected.

In the case of “On-Street” services, we patrol parking spaces owned by public authorities and issue
parking fines, which the consumer pays directly to the municipality. Under such contracts, we receive
a management fee from the municipality for the provision of our enforcement services. These fees are
reported under the ‘management agreement’ fee type. We do not book any of the control fees and fines
as part of our revenue.

_Other Services_

Our revenue from other services mainly includes charge-on of certain costs to management contract
clients, fees charged to owners and landlords for services provided to them in connection with our
contacts, such as revenue generated from the sale of parking equipment, income generated from
advertising activities and valet parking services.

##### 89


-----

**_Contract Retention and New Business_**

Our results of operations are affected by our ability to win, retain and renew lease and management
contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we had 7,000 sites under lease contracts and 4,700 sites under
management agreements and to May 31, 2021 we have signed new contracts accounting for €6.4 million
of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. The amount of new contracts signed per year has continued
to increase in recent years, from €12.2 million in 2018, to €12.4 million in 2019 and €13.2 million in
2020, in each case, of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution.

We have historically retained contracts accounting for more than 95% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract
Contribution in the past five years, which we believe is a result of our disciplined and proactive
approach to contract renewals for facilities that we consider desirable or less risky to our overall
business operations. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we renewed contracts
accounting for €8.6 million, €11.3 million and €22.7 million of total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution,
respectively. Our win rate has also increased, from approximately 35% in 2016 to 60% in 2019 and
75% in 2020. As a result of the successful renewal of these contracts, the volume of contracts that is
due for renewal by the end of 2026 is significantly lower and only accounts for an aggregate €44.8
million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019 representing on
average only 5% per annum across that period of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the
year ended December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2021, the remaining average duration of our top 100
lease contracts was 14 years and of our top 100 management contracts was approximately six years, in
both cases based on 2019 Pre-IFRS 16 weighted average Contract Contribution. We believe that our
high client retention rate, coupled with lower volumes of contract renewals in the period through to
2026, have historically contributed, and will continue to contribute, to the stability of our revenue
generation and earnings visibility.

Despite the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, in the year ended December 31, 2020
and the three months ended March 31, 2021 we signed new contracts which we estimate will contribute
an aggregate amount of approximately €53.6 million to our revenue and approximately €13.2 million
to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution and approximately €14.8 million to our revenue and
approximately €3.6 million to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, respectively. On average, the
Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution margin of new business won during 2020 is approximately 500bps
above the existing core portfolio of contracts. Our unweighted pipeline of new contracts has constantly
remained high, amounting to approximately €66 million, €67 million, €78 million and €80 million of
Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the
twelve months ended March 31, 2021, respectively. Prior to entering into a new contract for a parking
facility, we assess the optimum level of investment for that facility in order to increase its profitability
and produce a suitable return on our investment. Our level of investment will in turn depend on whether
or not we believe that the facility in question would benefit from extensive investment in the redesign
and addition of APCOA-specific features, such as APCOA FLOW and ANPR technology, which would
be typical for attractive locations with expected high demand for high quality parking, such as in the
City & Shopping sector. We typically agree a lower level of investment in facilities where cash flows
are less certain and/or there is a limited opportunity to realize financial benefits from our branding and
design. We typically recoup or initial investment after one to two years in the case of lease contracts
and less than one year in the case of management contracts. Contract Contribution recognized in the
year from new contracts increased from €8 million in 2016 to €13 million in 2019.

**_Cost Structure_**

Our results of operations are affected by our cost structure. Our cost structure mainly comprises fixed
costs, such as fixed rent payments, overhead personnel costs and costs associated with our parking
facilities, such as costs for maintenance and repairs and ancillary costs, which accounted for
approximately 40% of our costs in the year ended December 31, 2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), as well
as semi-variable costs, such as operational staff, cleaning costs, costs related to snow removal, travel
and equipment repairs, which accounted for approximately 30% of our cost base in the year ended
December 31, 2019 (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis). In addition, in the year ended December 31, 2019,

##### 90


-----

approximately 30% of our costs were variable (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis), mainly consisting of variable
rents and payment card processing fees.

_Rent_

Lease expenses, or rent, comprises fixed lease payments as well as performance-based variable lease
payments, which are generally calculated on a percentage of the sales revenue generated from the
underlying leased site. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, 57%, 58% and 46%,
respectively, of our pre-IFRS 16 rent expenses were variable. The fixed rent component under our lease
contracts is periodically adjusted based on the consumer price index or other benchmark indices. Our
total rent expenses amounted to €356.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 (of which €126.1
million was fixed and €230.6 million was variable), €321.5 million in the year ended December 31,
2017 (of which €129.0 million was fixed and €192.5 million was variable), €318.6 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 (of which €136.8 million was fixed and €181.8 million was variable), €344.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 (of which €144.0 million was fixed and €200.6 million
was variable) and €262.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (of which €141.1 million was
fixed and €121.1 million was variable), in each case, before giving effect to the application of IFRS 16.
Excluding the effects of IFRS 16, our comparatively low rent expenses for the year ended December
31, 2020 reflect a decrease in variable rents as a result of reduced revenue from lease contracts due to
the COVID-19 pandemic during that year. In addition, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic,
during the year ended December 31, 2020, we received government grants on a country-by-country
basis to offset fixed costs (including fixed lease payments, office rent, other operational expenditures
and other overhead expenses).

_Personnel Expenses_

Our personnel expenses constitute the second largest part of our cost structure after lease expenses.
Personnel expenses are largely fixed and semi-variable and include wages and salaries as well as social
security payments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we benefitted from a number of
government aid programs set up in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the jurisdictions in which
we operate our business. Pursuant to these programs, we received government grants in an aggregate
amount of €8.4 million, which were recognized as a reduction in personnel expenses in our 2020
Audited Financial Statements. In addition, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we took advantage of
employment support programs, such as Kurzarbeit in Germany, Cassa Integrazione in Italy, temporary
unemployment in Belgium and the furlough scheme in the United Kingdom.

_Cost of Materials and Purchased Services_

Our cost of materials are largely variable or semi-variable in nature and include (i) maintenance repair
costs and expenses for the repair of technical equipment, (ii) expenses for other external services, such
as payments in connection with external parking space monitoring and expenses for payment cards and
cleaning services, (iii) expenses for energy and other utilities and (iv) the costs of general operating
supplies, such as Pay & Display machines.

_Other Expenses_

Other operating expenses are mainly fixed in nature and include audit and consulting costs, information
technology expenses, expenses for temporary workers, expenses related to our fleet, travel expenses
and expenses for telecommunications. In the year ended December 31, 2020, we significantly reduced
our other operating expenses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, by terminating and furloughing
temporary employees (resulting in a €2.5 million reduction in other operating expenses), cancelling
nearly all business travel (resulting in a €2.2 million reduction in other operating expenses),
streamlining our vehicle fleet (resulting in a €1.2 million reduction in other operating expenses) and
severely limiting our marketing expenses (resulting in a €0.9 million reduction in other operating
expenses).

##### 91

**_Cost Savings and Efficiency Programs_**

Starting in 2017, we implemented several cost savings and operational efficiency initiatives focused on
(i) driving productivity in our control fee business line, (ii) optimizing site costs and (iii) reducing
central and procurements costs.

In order to increase the productivity in our control fee revenue stream, we optimized the deployment
and routing of parking attendants based on site occupancy, traffic congestion and historical hit rates.
We also minimized unproductive hours by starting the routes directly on site, reduced sickness rates
and used means of transportation reflecting the local traffic situation.

To optimize site costs across our business, we implemented group-wide benchmarks and best practices,
resulting in a streamlined FTE headcount and pooled resources to minimize overcapacity. We also
adjusted third-party services and reduced utilities costs.

To streamline our central and procurement costs, we implemented pooled customer service functions
cross-country, we digitized back-office processes and implemented self-administrative contract parker
platforms. In addition, we took steps to bundle our procurement activities across our entire business to
leverage our scale and generate cross-country synergies.

We estimate that these measures have resulted in total cost savings of approximately €10 million across
2017-2019, in addition to the various measures and savings introduced in 2020 in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are discussed elsewhere in this document.

**_Increased Digitization_**

Our business and results of operations are impacted by the increasing digitization of the parking
industry, which drives volumes and has resulted in parking convenience being a key factor when
deciding where to park. To grow our business, we increasingly rely on digital marketing, including a
robust social media presence, which continues to be a key driver of parking volumes. In addition, we
are increasing the use of our online sales and pre-booking platforms, which allow consumer to pre-book
parking spaces and purchase season tickets online. Between 2015 and 2019, the number of online prebooking services more than tripled. Furthermore, we believe that the increasing digitization of the
parking industry allows for new partnerships with participants across the broader automotive landscape,
such as fleet lessors, fuel card managers and parking services providers, which drive volumes at existing
sites and which we expect will provide for additional revenue streams, such as subscription fees for
partners’ services offered through our websites, in the future. To respond to the increased demand for
digital parking services, we launched our apps “APCOA Connect” in the United Kingdom and the
Republic of Ireland in 2012 as well as “APCOA FLOW” in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Austria,
Poland and Sweden from 2018, which enables consumers to access mobile, contactless on- and offstreet parking services. We estimate that we generated revenues of approximately €35 million through
these apps in the year ended December 31, 2019.

In addition, the digitization of the parking industry has allowed us to generate revenues from new
parking and services concepts, such as storage opportunities for logistics providers, virtual car rental
services and electronic vehicle charging, which we continue to roll out across our business through our
Urban Hubs initiative.

**_Acquisitions_**

Historically, value accretive acquisitions of attractive parking management service providers have been
a driver of both organic and non-organic growth in our operations, geographical reach, revenue and
profit margin. Our acquisitions have added €0.3 million, €6.8 million and €3.6 million to our EBITDA
(excluding the impact of IFRS 16 for years after December 31, 2018) for the ones conducted in the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Between January 2019 and March 31,

##### 92


-----

2021, we completed five acquisitions. As a result, our results of future periods will not be directly
comparable to past periods.

_Year Ended December 31, 2019_

On May 6, 2019, we acquired all of the shares in OnePark A/S in order to strengthen our presence in
Denmark and further accelerate our growth in that market. Since its foundation in 2012, OnePark has
been operating in the parking management sector, managing more than 30,000 parking spaces in
Denmark. We fully consolidated OnePark on the date of its acquisition. Between May 6, 2019 and
December 31, 2019, OnePark contributed revenues of €11.1 million and net profit of €2.7 million. If
the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2019, OnePark would have contributed revenues of €16.3
million and net profit of €3.5 million. The transaction costs for the acquisition of OnePark amounted to
€0.5 million, which we recognized in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019.

On August 8, 2019, we acquired all of the shares in Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited,
Mobile Research Solution Limited and Parking and Enforcement Agency Ltd. (collectively, NCPS) in
order to strengthen our presence in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and further accelerate
our growth in those markets. Since its foundation in 1998, NCPS has been operating in the parking
management sector, managing more than 100,000 parking spaces in Northern Ireland and the Republic
of Ireland. We fully consolidated NCPS on the date of its acquisition. Between August 8, 2019 and

our presence in Germany. Since its foundation in 2017, Alpina has been managing parking spaces in
the greater Munich area. If the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2019, Alpina would have
contributed revenues of €0.3 million and net loss of €26 thousand. The transaction costs for the
acquisition Alpina amounted to €0.1 million, which we recognized in other expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2019.

_Year Ended December 31, 2020_

On January 2, 2020, we acquired all of the shares in Xpert Parkering Sweden AB in order to strengthen
our presence in Sweden and further accelerate our growth in that market. Xpert manages more than
40,000 parking spaces in Sweden. We fully consolidated Xpert on the date of its acquisition. Between
January 2, 2020 and December 31, 2020, Xpert contributed revenues of €6.1 million and net profit of
€1.2 million. The transaction costs for the acquisition of Xpert amounted to €0.3 million, which we
recognized in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.

On December 1, 2020, we acquired all of the shares in Security Park AS, Profectum AS and Automaten
AS (collectively, the “Security Park Group”) in order to strengthen our presence in Norway. The

The transaction costs for the acquisition of the Security Park Group amounted to €0.4 million, which
we recognized in other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**_Foreign Currency Effects_**

We operate car parks in 13 countries of which six countries, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, Poland and Switzerland do not use the euro, our reporting currency, as their national currency.
Accordingly, our results of operations are subject to currency effects, primarily currency translation

exposure; transaction-related exposures at our subsidiaries are limited because revenue and costs are
largely incurred in their respective operating currencies. For our subsidiaries in countries with a
functional currency other than euro, income and losses are translated into euro at average exchange
rates, and assets and liabilities are translated into euro at closing exchange rates. Fluctuations in
exchange rates against the euro will give rise to period-on-period differences in our results of operations.
In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the three months ended March 31, 2021,
50%, 52%, 57% and 60%, respectively, of our revenue for such periods was reported by subsidiaries
whose functional currencies are different than the euro, primarily the British pound sterling, the Danish
krone, the Norwegian krone, Polish zloty, Swedish krona and Swiss franc. We are also subject to foreign
currency effects linked to loans denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the
entity that holds the loan, which creates unrealized foreign currency gains and/ or losses depending on
the fluctuation of the underlying foreign exchange rates.

(1) Primarily relates to refunds or cancellations of control fees.

Revenue decreased by €51.5 million, or 31.4%, to €112.4 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 as compared to €163.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenue in all of our geographies decreased in the three months
ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to reductions
in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Germany this decrease was partly offset by the impact of the new contract at Berlin Brandenburg
airport (€3.4 million) which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of 2020. In Norway, the
decrease was partially offset by revenue generated from the Security Park Group (€1.6 million), which
we acquired in December 2020.

Revenue by Sales Type

_Short term parking - Short-term parking revenue decreased by €42.0 million, or 53.6%, to €36.4 million_
for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €78.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2020, primarily due to reductions in frequencies and volumes caused by movement
restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

€29.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €32.8 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to reduced headcount and other costs required to service
these contracts caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Contract parking - Contract parking increased by €0.9 million, or 4.3%, to €22.8 million for the three_
months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €21.9 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020, primarily due to increased consumer demand for assigned parking spaces when using their car
for commuting due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Control fees - Control fees decreased by €4.3 million, or 22.9%, to €14.5 million for the three months_
ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €18.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
primarily due to reductions in parking violation volumes caused by movement restrictions in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Other services - Other services revenue decreased by €3.6 million, or 26.5%, to €10.0 million for the_
three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €13.6 million for the three months ended March 31,

_Sales deduction - Sales deductions decreased by €0.6 million, or 35.4%, to €1.0 million for the three_
months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
primarily due to lower overall control fee revenue.

_Other Income_

Other income decreased by €2.8 million, or 40.8%, to €4.0 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 as compared to €6.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due
to COVID-19-related booking of rent discounts.

_Rent_

Rent decreased by €14.9 million, or 34.0%, to €28.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
as compared to €43.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to lower
variable rent payments as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our rent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €63.3
million compared to €79.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was
primarily due to lower variable rent payments as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19
pandemic. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our variable rent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would
have been €27.3 million compared to €42.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
decrease was primarily as a result of decreased revenues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On a PreIFRS 16 basis, our fixed rent for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €36.0 million
compared to €37.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to some clients temporarily reducing or switching our rents to be variable in recognition of the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Cost of Material and of Purchased Services_

Cost of material and of purchased services decreased by €2.8 million, or 17.2%, to €13.7 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €16.6 million for the three months ended March 31,
2020, primarily due to lower levels of activity in the business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Personnel expenses decreased by €9.6 million, or 20.4%, to €37.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 as compared to €47.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily
due to reduced staff numbers (including those on furlough schemes) as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses decreased by €3.5 million, or 21.8%, to €12.5 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 as compared to €16.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily
due to lower levels of activity in the business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment_
_as well as right of use asset_

Amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment
as well as right of use assets decreased by €16.2 million, or 29.5%, to €38.7 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 as compared to €54.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020,
primarily due to 2020 including a right-of-use asset impairment in the United Kingdom, and impairment
of assets in Germany.

On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of
property, plant and equipment for the three months ended March 31, 2021 would have been €9.4 million

##### 96


-----

compared to €11.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to an impairment
of our property, plant and equipment in the three months ended March 31, 2020.

_Financial Income_

Financial income decreased by €11.7 million to €3.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021
as compared to €15.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a reduction
on the interest rate of our Existing Credit Facilities in February 2020, which resulted in a loan book
value adjustment.

_Financial Expenses_

Financial expenses decreased by €6.0 million, or 19.5%, to €24.8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2021 as compared to €30.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily
due to lower levels of foreign currency losses.

_Income Taxes_

Income tax expenses increased by €0.8 million to €1.1 million for the three months ended March 31,
2021 as compared to €0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to a write
down of deferred tax assets on interest losses carried forward.

**_Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2020_**

_Sales Revenues_

The following table shows our revenue by sales type for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020:

**Year ended December 31,**
**(in € million)** **2019** **2020**
Short-term parking.................................................................................................... 383.1 222.1
Management agreements .......................................................................................... 126.3 123.2
Contract parking ....................................................................................................... 82.5 87.0
Control fees .............................................................................................................. 76.8 65.9

(1) Primarily relates to refunds or cancellations of control fees.

Revenue decreased by €188.7 million, or 26.2%, to €531.9 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 as compared to €720.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reductions
in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
which was partially offset by increased revenue generation from contract parking. Revenue in all of our
geographies decreased in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31,
2019, primarily due to reductions in frequencies and volumes caused by movement restrictions in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Germany, this decrease was partially offset by the impact of
the new contract at Berlin Brandenburg airport which commenced operations in the fourth quarter of
2020. In Sweden, the decrease was also due to the loss of an airport taxi management contract in the
fourth quarter of 2019, partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of Xpert Parkering Sweden AB in
January 2020 which contributed revenue of €6.1 million in that year. In Denmark, the decrease was
partly offset by the impact of the acquisition of OnePark, which we acquired in May 2019 and
contributed to our revenue for a full year for the first time in 2020. In our non-key geographies, the
decrease in revenues was partially offset by new business contracts in Poland and by the impact of the
acquisition of NCPS in Ireland, which we acquired in August 2019 and contributed to our revenue for
a full year for the first time in 2020.

million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to sales deductions of €5.7 million for the

year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to €63.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019,

offset by an increase in audit and consulting costs as a result of increased M&A activity and other
administrative expenses.

due to additional capital expenditure completed in the year, a €11.2 million right-of-use asset
impairment in the United Kingdom and a €2.9 million property, plant and equipment impairment.

On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of
property, plant and equipment as well as right of use assets for the year ended December 31, 2020 would
have been €38.9 million compared to €31.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

primarily due to annual price increases.

_Control fees - Control fee revenue increased by €16.2 million, or 26.7%, to €76.8 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to €60.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to the impact of acquisitions completed in Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom and
new business contracts which commenced operations or contributed to our revenue for a full year for
the first time in 2019.

##### 100


-----

_Other services_ - Other services revenue remained relatively stable, only slightly decreasing by
€0.4 million, or 0.6%, to €57.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to
€58.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Sales deduction - Sales deductions increased by €0.8 million, or 16.3%, to €5.7 million for the year_
ended December 31, 2019 as compared to €4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily
due to higher levels of control fee cancellations following the acquisition of NCPS in Ireland in August
2019.

_Other Income_

Other income increased by €2.2 million, or 16.8%, to €15.1 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 as compared to €12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to an increase
in capitalized personnel expenses related to certain of our projects as well as an increase in income from
disposal of property, plant and equipment and income from release of provisions for pending losses.
This increase was partly offset by an insurance reimbursement and contract compensation payments in
2018 which did not reoccur in 2019.

_Rent_

Rent decreased by €111.0 million or 34.8%, to €207.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
as compared to €318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the introduction
of IFRS 16, which recategorized most of our fixed rent expenses, offset in part by the impact of new
business and growth in revenue in the year, resulting in higher variable rents.

On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our rent for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €344.7 million
compared to €318.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
new business and growth in revenue in the year, resulting in higher variable rents. On a Pre-IFRS 16
basis, our variable rent for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been €200.6 million
compared to €181.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
growth in revenue in the year. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our fixed rent for the year ended December 31,
2019 would have been €144.0 million compared to €136.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. This increase was primarily due to the impact of new businesses.

_Cost of Material and of Purchased Services_

Cost of material and of purchased services increased by €2.4 million, or 3.9%, to €63.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to €61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018,
primarily due to an increase in maintenance and repair costs, higher costs for external other services,
such as parking facility supervision in Italy and the United Kingdom as well as payment cards, and
increased costs for consumables, partially offset by expenses for cleaning materials and expenses for
waste and equipment costs.

_Personnel Expenses_

Personnel expenses increased by €11.9 million, or 7.0%, to €182.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as compared to €170.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily
due to annual pay rises and increased headcount needed to deliver new business contracts across various
countries.

_Other Expenses_

Other expenses increased by €2.0 million, or 3.1%, to €66.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 as compared to €64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to higher
expenses as a result of an increase in temporary workers.

_Amortization / Depreciation and Impairment of Intangible Assets and of Property, Plant and Equipment_
_as well as Right of Use Assets_

Amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of property, plant and equipment
as well as right of use assets increased by €114.3 million, or 372%, to €145.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2019 as compared to €30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due
to the introduction of IFRS 16.

On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our amortization / depreciation and impairment of intangible assets and of
property, plant and equipment as well as right of use assets for the year ended December 31, 2019 would
have been €31.9 million compared to €30.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase
was primarily due to the impact of additional capital expenditure conducted in the year.

_Financial Income_

Financial income increased by €1.0 million, or 81.6%, to €2.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 as compared to €1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to currency
gains registered in 2019 which resulted from the periodic measurement of loans denominated in foreign
currencies and the cash pool accounts in relation to our affiliated companies.

_Financial Expenses_

Financial expenses increased by €49.1 million to €74.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019
as compared to €25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to added interest
due to the implementation of IFRS 16.

_Income Taxes_

Income taxes decreased by €2.5 million, or 50.0%, to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 as compared to €5.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary liquidity requirements are to service our debt, fund our operations and for other general
corporate purposes. Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating
performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive,
market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other
factors including those discussed in this section and the section entitled “Risk Factors.” Following the
completion of the Transactions, we expect that our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flows from
operations as well as drawings under our New Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.”_

To manage our liquidity and working capital needs, we have entered into certain cash management
arrangements with Deutsche Bank. These arrangements are provided to us on customary terms in the
ordinary course of business and include, amongst others, zero balancing cash pooling and the collection
of direct debits. We will continue to utilize these services following the Issue Date. Any obligations
arising in connection with these cash management arrangements may be secured on the Collateral in
priority to the Notes.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we implemented a
number of measures to safeguard our liquidity, including drawing down a new €78 million term loan
facility (which resulted in additional liquidity of €68 million net of costs) and accessing €40 million of
funds provided by our Sponsor. Furthermore, we made selective use of economic stimulus and
government support programs where available, including furlough programs and government grants to
assist with lease payments. In addition, we reduced or postponed investments and expenses and, in
particular, we implemented a sustainable reduction in maintenance capital expenditures, introduced

short-time working arrangements for employees and reduced or deferred lease and rental payments in
agreement with our landlords.

We anticipate that we will be highly leveraged for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate
future financing cash flows will be limited by the Indenture and New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, which may have important negative consequences for you. See “Risk Factors,”
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”
Any additional indebtedness that we incur could reduce the amount of our cash flow available to make
payments on our then existing indebtedness, including under the Notes offered hereby, and increase our
leverage.

**_Cash Flow from Operating Activities_**

Our cash inflows from operating activities increased by €13.2 million, or 57.9%, from €22.7 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €35.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021.
The increase was primarily driven by a €33.3 million improvement in the cash impact of changes in
payables, from a payable outflow of €14.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020 to an
inflow of €19.2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. This positive impact was partially
offset by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in our group result before income taxes
decreasing by €13.0 million from the three months ended March 31, 2020 to the three months ended
March 31, 2021. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from operating activities for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 would have been an outflow of €1.1 million compared to an outflow of €13.6
million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a positive impact
from working capital, namely increased trade payables and lower trade receivables, partly offset by the
impact of the COVID-19, which resulted in a significantly lower EBITDA compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2020.

Our cash inflow from operating activities decreased by €87.9 million, or 42%, from €209.1 million in
the year ended December 31, 2019 to €121.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. This
decrease was mainly due to the sharp decrease in operating profit caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
during the course of 2020. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from operating activities for the year
ended December 31, 2020 would have been an outflow of €31.6 million compared to an inflow of €64.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in a lower EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our cash inflow from operating activities increased by €152.1 million, from €57.0 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €209.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by the introduction of IFRS 16 and the resultant changes in presentation, although the
improved operating cash flow also contributed to the increase on a like-for-like basis. On a Pre-IFRS
16 basis, our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have
been a cash inflow of €64.4 million compared to a cash inflow of €57.0 million for the year ended
December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to an increased inflow from working capital in
2019.

**_Cash Flow from Investing Activities_**

Our cash outflows from investing activities decreased by €9.5 million, or 62.0%, from €15.4 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2020 to €5.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. This
decrease was primarily driven by payments for granted loans of €4.8 million in 2020 which was incurred
in 2020 but not in 2021 and payments for acquisitions of affiliated companies decreased by €3.4 million.
On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from investing activities for the three months ended March 31,
2021 would have been an outflow of €5.4 million compared to an outflow of €15.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was mainly due to our higher outflows in the three months
ended March 31, 2020 due to the acquisition of Xpert Parkering Swede AB and loans to our Belgian
joint venture, ParcBrux BV.

Our cash outflows from investing activities decreased by €22.7 million, or 34.4%, from an outflow of
€66.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 to an outflow of €43.3 million in the year ended
December 31, 2020. The decrease was mainly due to the lower level of capital expenditure in the year
ended December 31, 2020. Cash flow from investing activities in 2020 include €10.8 million of cash
used for acquisitions (less cash and cash equivalents acquired). On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow
from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been an outflow of €41.9
million compared to an outflow of €64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease
was due to our capital expenditure reduction initiative, which decreased capital expenditure year-onyear, the acquisition of Security Park AS in Norway and a higher spend on loans to our Belgian joint
venture, ParcBrux BV.

##### 104


-----

Our cash outflows from investing activities increased by €38.2 million, from €27.8 million in the year
ended December 31, 2018 to €66.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by the greater number and value of acquisitions in the year ended December 31, 2019
resulting in total cash outflows from investing activities in the amount of €40.9 million (less cash
acquired in the amount of €2.7 million), while we only acquired one business in the year ended
December 31, 2018 for a low single digit million euro amount. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow
from investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been a cash outflow of
€64.4 million compared to a cash outflow of €27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This
decrease was primarily due to investments in the company acquisitions conducted in 2019.

**_Cash Flow from Financing Activities_**

Our cash outflows from financing activities increased by €41.9 million, from €2.7 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2020 to €44.6 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021. This increase
was primarily driven by the lower outflow incurred in 2020. In the three months ended March 31, 2020,
we paid a €90 million dividend to our principal shareholder, which was partly offset by a €131.0 million
inflow from payments received from long-term financial debt. This positive impact did not reoccur in
2021 and with other movements within this section remaining stable year-on-year, there was a higher
outflow in 2021. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from financing activities for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 would have been an outflow of €8.1 million compared to an inflow of €33.5
million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to financial
liabilities which increased in the three months ended March 31, 2020, offset by a dividend payout we
made in the three months ended March 31, 2020 which did not reoccur in the three months ended March
31, 2021.

Our cash outflows from financing activities decreased by €60.9 million, or 47.9%, from €127.2 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019 to €66.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. In the year
ended December 31, 2020, payments received from long-term financial debt increased to €205.1
million. In addition, we repaid lease liabilities and financial liabilities in the amount of €140.7 million
(compared to €101.2 million in 2019) and incurred interest payments, bank charges and transaction
costs in the amount of €80.5 million (compared to €68.1 million in 2019), including interest on lease
liabilities in the amount of €52.1 million (compared to €50.6 million in 2019). In addition, in the year
ended December 31, 2020, we paid a dividend to our principal shareholder which resulted in a cash
outflow of €90.0 million, partly offset by an equity injection by our principal shareholders which
resulted in a cash inflow of €40.0 million. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been €85.1 million compared to €16.0
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the increase in
financial debt which was partly offset by the dividend payment to our shareholder.

Our cash outflows from financing activities increased by €100.1 million, from an outflow of €27.1
million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of €127.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by a redemption of liabilities from finance
leases as a result of the the implementation of IFRS 16. In the year ended December 31, 2019, interestbearing loans from third parties increased to €42.2 million, primarily to fund the company acquisitions
conducted in 2019. In addition, we repaid lease liabilities in the amount of €101.2 million (compared
to €6.4 million from finance leasing in 2018) and incurred interest payment, bank charges and
transaction costs in the amount of €68.1 million (compared to €20.5 million in 2018), including interest
on lease liabilities in the amount of €50.6 million. On a Pre-IFRS 16 basis, our cash flow from financing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 would have been a cash inflow of €16.0 million
compared to a cash outflow of €27.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to increases in borrowings to fund the company acquisitions conducted in 2019.

**Capital Expenditures**

Our capital expenditures include (i) expansion capital expenditures comprising new business and digital
infrastructure capital expenditures, (ii) renewal capital expenditures, (iii) maintenance capital
expenditures and (iv) cars & overhead capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures exclude, in each
case, finance leases.

Expansion capital expenditures comprise new business and digital infrastructure capital expenditures:

- New business capital expenditures relate to investments in new business contracts in order to
get them operational. Examples include the new installation or the replacement of prior operator
equipment with new parking equipment (barrier systems, lane branding, servers, cash machines
and other payment points).

- Digital infrastructure capital expenditures relate to investments in our digitalization strategy,
including the inclusion of the car park onto our FLOW platform.

Renewal capital expenditures comprises investments related to renewed contracts and include the
upgrade of existing equipment or refurbishing the appearance of car parks (new lane branding, paint,
lighting etc.).

Maintenance capital expenditures relate to the maintenance of car parks within our lease portfolio.
Examples include necessary repairs of broken equipment, lighting, or regulatory required upgrades, for
example to cash or card payment machines.

Car & overhead capital expenditures include investments in cars for operational and overhead staff as
well as investments related to headquarters or non-operational functions, such as ERP updates,
information technology hardware & software.

The level of capital expenditures at any given parking facility varies depending on whether the facility
is subject to a lease or management contract. Our total capital expenditures in the years ended December
31, 2018 and 2019 were relatively stable at €32.2 million and €37.1 million, respectively. In response
to the COVID-19 pandemic situation, in the year ended December 31, 2020, we deferred all nonessential capital expenditures to 2021, resulting in a reduction of our non-growth capital expenditures
by 9.4%, to €10.6 million, in the year ended December 31, 2020. We also deferred some growth capital
expenditures to 2021, resulting in a reduction of our expansion capital expenditure by 28.0%, to € 13.6
million, in the year ended December 31, 2020.

The following table sets forth our combined capital expenditures (excluding finance leases) for the
periods indicated on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis.

Expansion capital expenditures in the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased by €0.7 million to
€3.0 million from €3.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily
due to a reduction in digital infrastructure capital expenditures due to ongoing strict control of our
capital expenditures following the COVID-19 pandemic. Renewal capital expenditures in the three
months ended March 31, 2021 increased by €0.1 million to €0.8 million from €0.7 million in the three
months ended March 31, 2020. This increase was driven by renewal investments across eleven parking
facilities. The biggest investment we undertook in the first quarter of 2021 was Parking Westblaak in
the Netherlands. Maintenance capital expenditures in the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased
by €0.7 million to €0.3 million from €1.0 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to ongoing strict control of our capital expenditures following the COVID19 pandemic. Car & overhead capital expenditures in the three months ended March 31, 2021 decreased
by €0.4 million to €0.5 million from €0.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. This
decrease was primarily due to due to ongoing strict control of our capital expenditures following the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Expansion capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €5.3 million to €13.6
million from €18.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to
ongoing strict control of our capital expenditures following the COVID-19 pandemic. Renewal capital
expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by €0.4 million to €2.9 million from €2.5
million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our largest renewal investments in 2020 included
Southwark (On Street Enforcement) in the United Kingdom, Berlin Alexa in Germany and Stuttgart
Bosch Areal. Maintenance capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €0.4
million to €4.1 million from €4.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to ongoing strict control of our capital expenditures following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Car & overhead capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by €1.1 million
to €3.6 million from €4.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily
due to ongoing strict control of our capital expenditures following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Expansion capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €1.6 million to €18.9
million from €17.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to
increased investment in our digital strategy for the development and rollout of our APCOA FLOW app.
Renewal capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by €0.6 million to €2.5
million from €3.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to
lower levels of contract renewals requiring investment in replacement parking equipment. Maintenance
capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €0.9 million to €4.5 million
from €3.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our largest maintenance expenditures in 2020
included Parking de Montbenon in Switzerland, Billund airport and Køge Strædet shopping center in
Denmark. Car & overhead capital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by €1.4
million to €4.7 million from €3.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2019, we conducted
major car purchases in Sweden, particularly relating to our Stockholm on-street contract, and invested
in our headquarters for renovation purposes and IT infrastructure in the countries in which we operate.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements.

**_Other Financial Obligations: Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

Our employees are granted certain pension entitlements and similar benefits under our pension plans.
For a description of our pension plans and similar obligations, see note 36 to our 2020 Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Financial Risk Management**

We are exposed to financial risks in the form of liquidity risks, tax risks, credit risks, currency risk and
interest rate risk during the course of our ordinary business activities.

##### 107


-----

Non-financial or non-quantifiable risks, such as business risks or reputational risks, are not considered
here.

**_Liquidity Risks_**

Liquidity risks relate to the prospect of our Group not being able to fulfil its financial obligations. We
manage our liquidity by maintaining liquid reserves and bank credit lines alongside the cash inflows
from its operating business, and by having access to the capital market through continuous dialogue.
Operational liquidity management comprises the daily pooling of liquid funds in the Group’s cash pool,
which the Group Treasury function coordinates. In this way, liquidity surpluses and shortages can be
managed both in accordance with the requirements of the Group as a whole and those of the individual
Group companies.

For budget planning purposes, a monthly liquidity plan was prepared for 2021, which was updated and
extended to 2022. Liquidity at the level of both the Group and the national companies is monitored
continuously. A Group liquidity status report is compiled daily for this purpose. In addition, regularly
(once a week in times of large uncertainty, every three weeks in times of more stability) all units prepare
a rolling 17-week liquidity forecast by planning category.

Since March 2020, our liquidity risk has increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on
our revenue. We introduced a number of early and comprehensive measures in response to the COVID19 pandemic to safeguard our liquidity. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

**_Tax Risks_**

Tax risks can arise for our Group if local tax authorities fail to agree with our assessment of a specific
case. This risk is taken into consideration by obtaining tax advice and monitoring the relevant matters.
The resulting tax risks could have a moderate short-term bearing on our finances.

**_Credit Risks_**

Credit risks arise from the possibility that contractual partners to a transaction prove unable to fulfil
their financial obligations, thereby causing financial losses for our Group. Receivables default risks are
low as a result of our business model. This risk is further minimized by the wide geographical
distribution of such receivables, and their spread across a large number of individual debtors. The
elevated default risk in the parking facility management business unit arising from non-payers is
reflected through value adjustments to individual accounts receivables.

**_Currency Risks_**

Currency risks for our Group arise primarily from investments, financing measures and operative
activities. Our national subsidiaries are provided with the necessary financial means in their local
currencies so that no significant currency risks are generated for the national subsidiaries. We do not
hedge against currency risks that do not influence the Group’s cash flow (risks arising from the currency
conversion of foreign financial statements into the Group’s reporting currency, so-called translation
risks). As debt funding for our Group is provided in the Group currency (euro) and partly differs from
the currencies of the local APCOA companies, a translation risk arises from exchange rate fluctuations.
This risk is monitored on a monthly basis with hedging measures being implemented where required.
Additionally, currency risks arising from cash flows are monitored on a monthly basis.

**_Interest Rate Risks_**

Risks of interest rate changes arise based on potential changes in the market interest rates and can lead
to a change in the fair value of fixed-interest financial instruments, and fluctuations in interest payments
on variable interest rate financial instruments. In the medium term, we expect interest rates to remain
low and assess the risk of substantial rate increases to be minor. The relevant reference interest rate of

##### 108


-----

our Group is EURIBOR, and due to the agreed floor of 0%, a slight increase does not affect interest
payments. Based on this assessment and to avoid additional financial costs (especially front-end fees),
we have currently decided against interest rate hedging of our variable rate liabilities. Following the
Offering, we will be exposed to additional interest risk. See “Risk Factors—The Floating Rate Notes
_and drawings under the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at floating rates that could_
_rise significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow.” The company monitors and assess_
interest rate risks on a monthly basis so it can react quickly to changes in the market.

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our management must make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
Financial Statements, based on historical experience, existing and known circumstances, authoritative
accounting pronouncements and other factors that management believes to be reasonable, but actual
results could differ materially from these estimates. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is
unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated for these key estimates. However, we made appropriate
accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the
extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our Financial Statements may
be materially affected.

We apply estimates and judgments by management especially in the following accounting policies.

**_Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

Our business activities have been significantly affected by the pandemic and the associated uncertainties
since March 2020. In particular, due to the still not fully foreseeable global consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the estimates and discretionary decisions made in connection with the assets and
liabilities reported in the balance sheet are subject to a greater level of uncertainty.

In updating the estimates and judgements, management took into account the information available
concerning expected economic trends and country-specific government policies.

This information was included particularly in impairment tests for the cash-generating units; in the case
of impairment of trade receivables, the expected credit loss model was reviewed in relation to the
assessment of future economic conditions in the context of COVID-19. Furthermore, this information
was taken into account in the tax planning prepared by the Norwegian subsidiary, as sufficient taxable
income exists in the long-term against which the loss carry forwards can be offset.

**_Trade Receivables_**

All trade receivables are initially recognized at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted for
impairment to reflect the expected default. The calculation is based on historical default rates, which
are adjusted to reflect current economic developments. As a rule, a decline in the volume of receivables
reduces such value adjustments on a portfolio basis accordingly, and vice versa. If individual
receivables are at risk of default, estimates and assessments based on the respective client’s
creditworthiness are included.

**_Impairment_**

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit, an asset and an intangible asset
with an indefinite useful life is based on management estimates. The recoverable amount is the higher
of the fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Management normally determines these values in
line with valuation methods based on discounted cash flows. These discounted cash flows are calculated
on the basis of five-year forecasts which are prepared in line with financial plans authorized by the
Management Board. The cash flow forecasts take into consideration historical data and are based on the
Management Board’s best estimates of future development. Cash flows beyond the planning period are
extrapolated applying a standard growth rate that is determined in consideration of the expected long
##### 109


-----

term development potential of the relevant markets and publicly available long-term inflation
expectations as well as the possibility of passing these on to customers in the form of price increases.
Weighted average costs of capital are utilized to discount the cash flows. These are based on a peer
group and were determined using capital market data. The most important assumptions on which the
determination of fair value less costs to sell and value in use is based include estimated cash flows,
estimated growth rates, weighted average costs of capital, and tax rates. The measurement of intangible
assets with indeterminable useful lives is additionally dependent on the underlying license rates. These
premises and their underlying methodology can have a significant impact on the respective values and
ultimately on the amount of possible impairment of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives, and other assets.

**_Pensions and Similar Obligations_**

Obligations for pensions and similar commitments and related expenses and income are calculated in
accordance with actuarial valuations. Such valuations are based on key assumptions, including
discounting factors, wage and pension trends, and life expectancies. The discount factor applied reflects
the interest rates that can be achieved as of the balance sheet date for high-value fixed-interest
investments with matching maturities. The underlying assumptions can differ from actual outcomes due
to a fluctuating market and economic situation. This can exert significant effects on the obligations of
pensions and other post-retirement benefits. The resultant differences are recognized directly in other
comprehensive income under equity in the period in which they arise, and do not affect profit and loss
as a consequence.

**_Other Provisions_**

The calculation of provisions is associated with significant estimates. Other provisions are formed for
a large number of individual risks whose payment dates or amounts are uncertain. Determining these
other provisions requires the making of estimates. These provisions also relate to provisions against
risks arising from legal disputes and processes, insofar as these fulfil the criteria for making provisions.
Assessing the level of such provisions entails not only an assessment of circumstances in the specific
case that is being asserted, but also making recourse to the results of comparable proceedings and
appraisals by lawyers and other factors, as well as assumptions about event probabilities and the
bandwidths of potential utilization.

**_Income Tax_**

The recognition of tax provisions is based on estimates. It should also be determined whether the
recognition of deferred tax assets is permitted, or whether a valuation adjustment to deferred tax assets
is required. The likelihood that deferred tax assets arising from timing differences and losses carried
forward can be offset against taxable profits in the future must be evaluated. Deferred tax assets must
also be recognized to the extent that sufficient taxable temporary differences are available. Uncertainties
exist concerning the interpretation of complex tax regulations as well as concerning the amount and
date of future taxable income.

**Leasing**

The measurement of liabilities from leases and rights of use assets requires assumptions to be made
regarding key parameters or their probabilities and dates of occurrence or exercise, as well as the
determination of an appropriate capitalization rate. In determining the term of leases, all facts and
circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise renewal options or not to exercise
termination options are taken into consideration. Term changes arising from the exercise of renewal or
termination options are only included in the contract term if their exercise is reasonably certain. For
APCOA PARKING Group this is regularly the case if the exercise option lies within the detailed
planning period and is reflected in planning.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued, which are adopted by us as of the
specified effective date. We believe that the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant
impact on our Financial Statements.

**Introduction**

Parking plays a pivotal role in daily activity around private and professional mobility, local and
international travel, leisure and general location based activities, transportation, quality of life and
environmental issues. Generally, the parking infrastructure and parking operations and management
business, has limited demand risk and limited direct competition. Additionally, the industry benefits
from a degree of regulatory protection and stability because it provides a critical service to
municipalities. The number of car parking spaces has been growing in Europe driven by a variety of
factors which include urbanization and an increase in the number of cars. The profitability of the sector
is generally improving, supported by scale efficiencies, the implementation of cost savings programs
and the utilization of digital based technologies, among others.

In aggregate, there are 24 million parking spaces in APCOA’s geographies, of which approximately
60% are off-street and 40% are on-street. APCOA’s top 6 countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Italy,
Sweden, Denmark and Norway) account for 18 million of these spaces, of which 11 million are offstreet.

Despite approximately 40% of European parking spaces being on-street, major industry players are
focused on the off-street segment due to legislation that restricts private operators from operating onstreet car spaces. Parking spaces located in cities and shopping centers are the two largest sectors in
Europe, accounting for 70% of regulated off-street parking spaces.

**Parking Market by Segment**

Based on segment, the parking market is divided between on-street and off-street car parks.

**On-street parking spaces are regulated spaces on the roadway with some type of signaling, control or**
surveillance and can be paid or be for free. Parking is short-term, and this segment is typically very
much exposed to city policies and regulatory changes. In this segment, parking operators usually offer
meter management services (i.e. management and maintenance of parking meters) and revenue
collection (i.e. issuance and collection of fines through enforcement services) on behalf of the
municipality.

**Off-street parking spaces are parking spaces for public-use in dedicated facilities. These can be both**
indoor and outdoor, single or multi-storey and used short-term (hourly) or long-term (monthly and
yearly). They tend to be located in high footfall locations e.g. city centers and airports. These spaces
can be: i) publicly or privately managed; ii) paid or for free, and; iii) in-structure or on-surface. Instructure parking refers to multilevel or underground car parks while on-surface refers to uncovered car
parks at street level with horizontal signs and access control (barrier, attendant, ANPR etc.). An
additional category of off-street parking is Park & Ride, consisting of parking spaces close to coach,

##### 112


-----

rail stations or other means of transport that allow commuters to leave their vehicle and commute via
bus, rail, etc. for the remainder of the journey.

The off-street segment is the most relevant in terms of overall economics generated given the
significantly higher revenue per space and EBITDA margins compared to on-street (lower margin
profile for on-street parking is primarily driven by cost-plus outsourcing enforcement contracts).

Within off-street parking, spaces located in cities and shopping centers represent the largest segment
accounting for c. 70% of the total outsourced market, followed by spaces located in airports.

**Car Parking Location**

Parking spaces located in city and shopping centers and airports account for a large proportion of the
market.

Parking spaces located in city and shopping centers typically have high turnover with shorter stays
lasting a few hours or a day. Landlords are mainly municipalities, infrastructure funds, companies,
private investors, shopping centre operators / owners in addition to a large number of less sophisticated
private landlords.

Parking spaces located in airports typically have a lower rotation given travelling passengers stay for
days to weeks at a time (except for drop-off parkers). Landlords are mainly sophisticated airport
operators / owners given the importance and size of the business with relevant negotiation power upon
contract renewal. Given the growing importance of car parking economics within airport activities, in
a few cases airport operators have decided to keep the management of parking spaces in-house in order
to realize all car park economics despite a lack of operating experience. Contracts are usually large and
the underlying volume risk is linked to air traffic volume. Volume risk is mitigated by an ongoing shift
in the airport parking market to management contracts (primarily fixed fee) and the introduction of
specific clauses within lease agreements limiting downside risks for airport parking operators.

**Parking Market by Operating Model**

By operating model, the car park market can be split by: (i) management contracts, (ii) lease contracts,
(iii) concessions and (iv) full ownership.

**Management contracts represent service agreements with short to mid-term contract length, usually**
3-8 years, where the operator is responsible for operating a car park on behalf of the landlord or
concession owner. Overall risks to the operator under these contracts are very limited given low
investments required, no exposure to traffic risk and limited location risk. Facility maintenance
activities are generally up to the landlord and other required investments are very limited from the
operator perspective. The operator is not subject to traffic risk as most contracts primarily involve fee
based payments given that strategic decisions like tariff policy, etc., remain with the landlord of the car
park. There is limited exposure to location risk given the length of these contracts.

Management contract business represent approximately 30-40% of total European market spaces, with
a typical contract contribution margin of 10-20%. The lower economics generated by this segment in
terms of revenue and margin can be explained by the lower underlying risk of the business, given a
revenue model based on broadly fixed fees agreed with the landlord, where the revenue generated by
the consumers that park go directly to the landlord, hence no volume risk, and limited investment and
location risks.

**Lease contracts represent rental agreements with mid-term contract lengths, usually between seven to**
20 years (including options to extend), where the operator runs the parking facility and pays an annual
rent to the lessor that can be fixed and/or variable depending on specific success factors. Overall risk
borne by the operator under these types of contracts is higher than with management contracts but
sensibly lower compared to concession and full ownership agreements, given lower investments

##### 113


-----

required, and lower location risk. Under lease contracts the operator is responsible for installation &
maintenance of parking equipment. Other investments required are usually limited and shared with the
landlord, however higher than the ones required under management contracts. The operator is subject
to full traffic exposure given the revenue stream is mainly based on car park ticket fares from users.
Lease contracts represent the largest proportion (approximately 40-50%) of total European market
spaces, with a typical contract contribution margin of 15-25%. There is limited location risk compared
to concession or full ownership agreements given the limited 7-20-year contract length.

**Concessions represent long-term contracts with duration typically between 30-50 (sometimes up to 99)**
years, where the operator acts as a temporary owner responsible also for building maintenance activities.
In greenfield concessions the operator is responsible for both building and operating the new car park
on behalf of a concession-owner to whom it pays royalties. In brownfield concessions the operator runs
an existing car park on behalf of a concession-owner to whom it pays royalties, but the operator is not
involved in the construction of the car park and hence initial investment requirements are lower than in
greenfield concessions. In both cases the operator is exposed to high investment requirements and full
traffic risk, given the revenue stream is mainly based on car park ticket fares from users. Furthermore,
the operator is subject to any long-term location risk that might arise.

Under **full ownership the operator owns the parking facilities. This model requires high capital**
investment including build-up of the facility or buy-out of existing property and ongoing maintenance
investments. The operator is exposed to high investment requirements and full short and long-term
traffic and location risk, given the revenue stream is mainly based on car park ticket fares from users.

By number of spaces, concession and full ownership operating models represent approximately 5-15%
of European parking spaces, with a typical contract contribution margin of 30-40%. Margins in this
segment are the highest in the market given the higher capital invested and risk exposure compared to
other operating models.

**Car Parking Locations**

The car park industry can be divided into various sectors and locations with different characteristics:

**Sector** **Key Characteristics**

**Structural Growth Drivers of the Parking Sector**

**_Personal Car Fleet Growth and Urbanization_**

In Western Europe, the vehicle parc is expected to continue growing steadily at +0.8% CAGR from
2021-2025E, and remain an important driver of the parking industry’s turnover. Additionally, the
Western European urban population is forecasted to increase by +0.4% CAGR from 2021-2025E. This
increase is expected to drive demand for parking in cities.

**_Favorable Pricing Dynamics that Support Larger Companies_**

Larger companies in the parking industry benefit from the high barriers to entry, particularly in offstreet parking which include:

- Operational economies of scale which support the pricing and winning of new contracts

- Pricing power advantage stemming from operating car parks in close proximity to each other

Limited supply of new parking spaces, especially in city centers, which benefits the larger players with
established positions and long-term contracts

**_Shift in Cities from On-street to Off-street Parking_**

Across Europe, particularly in large city centers, local municipalities are disincentivising on-street
parking due to urban planning, traffic and environmental concerns. They continue to do this through
increasing pricing, reducing spaces and introducing maximum allowed parking times.

These factors are supporting the shift to off-street parking which is expected to increase as a percentage
of total regulated parking spaces over time. As a result of these trends it is expected that people will
increasingly use off-street parking upon arrival in a city and then use other forms of transport to
commute within the city center.

Percentage of Regulated On-street and Off-street Parking Spaces (2018)

**_Increasing Level of Outsourcing_**

Outsourcing share of parking operations is expected to grow for a number of reasons, which include the
need of owners to maximize utilization of their assets, increased adoption of technologies e.g. digital,
economies of scale and budget pressures on local municipalities.

As of 2018, the level of outsourcing across APCOA’s countries of operations was approximately 40%
and there remains significant opportunity for an increase in outsourcing share, particularly in Germany.

**_Pricing Inflation_**

Pricing inflation, driven by relatively low price elasticity and advanced pricing techniques is expected
across sectors, especially in city centers.

**_Net New Build_**

Increasing net new build is driven by construction activity, supported by low interest rates, high liquidity
and growing demand for parking across most sectors.

**Industry Trends**

**_Car Sharing and Autonomous Vehicles_**

The parking industry is expected to be shaped in the long-term by key global trends such as the
increasing penetration of electric vehicles, connected cars and drivers, shared parking slots, autonomous
driving vehicles and a decline in car ownership.

Increase in electric vehicle usage and connectivity between cars and drivers is expected to have a
positive impact on the parking market growth by 2025. Electric vehicles are expected to bring additional
revenues for car park operators through fees for chargeable parking spaces. Increasing connectivity
between cars and drivers in parking slots (i.e. real time update on parking slot availability) is expected
to generate additional returns via dynamic pricing and increased stickiness to first-movers.

##### 116


-----

In five years’ time, shared parking slots could enable the entrance of new players in the market and
slow demand for traditional parking operators which, on the other hand, can leverage on their size to
execute acquisitions or partner with new operators.

In 2030–2040+ the “traditional” market is likely going to be impacted by increasing penetration of
shared AVs and robo-taxis leading to uptake of on-demand shared mobility which may dampen volume
growth of traditional parking. Beyond 2030, the market is expected to grow at 1.8–2.5% p.a.

Autonomous driving vehicles could represent the only real disruption in the market with cars potentially
able to look for cheaper parking nearby or free parking farther away from the drop-off location. It might
on the other hand offer greater opportunity for real individual & personalized transport. Given the
current status of autonomous development, this scenario is unlikely to breakthrough before 2025-2030.
Technical/regulatory barriers could further postpone and mitigate the envisaged long-term market
effects. Penetration of AVs is expected to reach 10–15% of total car parking by 2040 and is likely
leading to changes in the mobility landscape with the rise of shared mobility solutions driven by robotaxi fleets in large cities.

**_Technological Trends_**

The use of technology is increasing across the car parking sector. In more mature markets, technology
allows for more efficient use of parking facilities for car park users as well as an increase in revenue
and cost reduction for car parking operators. Operators increasingly leverage technology to enhance
their customer offering and yield management, leading to increased customer loyalty and repeat
business.

Recent examples of technological innovations include:

- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR): integrates with various devices, such as**
access control systems and CCTV cameras, to capture images of vehicle license plates. Main
applications include ticketless parking fee management, parking access automation, vehicle
location guidance, car theft prevention, automated payment process and others

- **Electronic parking guidance systems: real-time message boards directing drivers to nearby**
parking facilities to help decrease the time required to locate a parking space. Major cities such
as Paris, Barcelona and Munich have installed such advanced parking guidance systems

- **Pay-by-phone: improves parking fee collection and the payment services can be outsourced to**
a third-party vendor, who charges customers a service fee, thereby passing down any costs

**_Mobility Hubs_**

New mobility trends are also enabling car parks to extend their offering and become mobility hubs by
leveraging their unique locations in city centers. As a result, the “traditional” car parking business will
be reshaped into a multi-revenue stream business. Car parks have the potential to become intermodal
mobility hubs, catering to new consumer needs such as EV charging, car sharing parking, last mile
vehicles parking (e.g. electric bikes).

New use cases enabled by mobility hubs will also emerge and allow car parking operators to diversify
and tap new revenue streams in last-mile distribution, delivery pick-up locations, food delivery or selfstorage. Multiple operators around the globe have recognized this trend and are developing new

##### BUSINESS

**Overview**

We are a leading parking infrastructure operator and services provider in the European market, with a
large and diversified portfolio of leased and managed parking facilities across 13 European countries.
We operate off-street parking facilities under leases from private and public landlords, and also operate
on- and off-street parking facilities for clients under management contracts. As of March 31, 2021, we
operated approximately 11,700 parking facilities with over 1.6 million parking spaces. We believe we
are either the leading or number two parking facility operator by number of parking spaces in each of
our ten largest country markets.

We benefit from a large, structurally attractive and growing parking market that we believe will benefit
from ongoing outsourcing, mobility and other industry trends such as growth in the number of vehicles
in Europe, urban areas, electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, car hiring and sharing and more recently use
of the car parks as infrastructure for the e-commerce value chain and customer delivery. During 2018,
the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues of which
approximately €11 to 12 billion was spent on outsourcing parking management. We believe we are well
positioned to capture the benefits from these trends and the general economic recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic expected in 2021 and 2022 because we create significant, stable and recurring
value for our clients, for whom parking facilities are often a non-core operation, by providing a large
scale platform that is focused on driving higher revenues by increasing volume, pricing and utilization,
at a lower cost of operation.

Our operations benefit from a diverse portfolio of lease and management contracts as well as
geographical, business sector and customer diversification, which made our business more resilient
during the COVID-19 pandemic, while at the same time allowing us to leverage operational similarities
to benefit from scale economies. Our parking facilities are spread across most of Europe (with certain
clusters for operational efficiency) and apart from one large market (Germany), five other countries
(Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Norway) each contributed approximately 10% of
our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We operate in a wide
range of business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and
hospitality, and parking enforcement, with limited correlation between them. Furthermore, many of our
parking facilities are not dedicated to a single institution, business or purpose but are instead multifunctional and used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether it is for work, shopping,
restaurant or cultural activities, or other purposes. We have very low contract concentration, with over
5,900 contracts across over 11,700 parking facilities.

The breakdown of our revenue generated by fee type and client contract as well as the breakdown of
our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution generated by country of operation and business sector for the
year ended December 31, 2019 is as follows:

**Business Sector**


We have made significant investments in recent years in our information technology and digital delivery
in order to make our facilities and services more attractive to both motorists and landlords. We offer
motorists various services related to on-street and off-street parking via smartphone applications and
end customer-oriented websites. These services cover the entire parking customer experience, from
searching for and reserving a parking space, navigating to the parking garage, contactless entry and exit,
and electronic payment. This saves motorists from having to draw a ticket, walk to the ticket machine
or cash machine and pay with cash, making the parking process easier, faster and more comfortable for
the end customer. These digital services also allow for additional yield management through
differentiated pricing according to the number of available spaces, distribution channel, location and
size of specific parking spaces and customer groups.

We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models, lease contracts and management
contracts. In each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring
significant capital expenditures and thus through an “asset light” approach that is flexible and scalable,
because we operate the facilities as opposed to owning them. Our long-term underlying contract
structures provide us with stability of revenues and the ability to forecast and plan. As of March 31,
2021, our average contract life (including extensions) for our top 100 contracts (based on weighted
average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019) was approximately
31 years with an average remaining life of approximately 12 years.

- _Lease Contracts. We lease parking sites from our clients, where we are responsible for running_
the parking operations and driving site-revenue. We receive parking fees directly from the
consumers parking in our leased sites and we pay rent to the lessor, either as a fixed rent, a
variable rent or a combination of fixed and variable rent payments. We focus on driving yield
at the site by increasing parking volume and price. We have a mix of short and long-term
parking customers at our leased sites. Short-term parking includes customers who pay on a perhour or per-day basis. Short-term parking generated 53% of our total revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2019. Long-term, or contract parking revenue, includes customers holding
season tickets, including monthly, quarterly and annual season tickets, and individual customers
and business customers who may contract for multiple spaces. Long-term contract parking
generated 11% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Short-term parking
customers provide immediate payment in cash, by debit or credit cards, or through payment
apps at the location of our parking facilities. In addition, in some countries, including Norway
and Sweden, short-term parking customers are charged via invoice after the parking event has
been completed, for which we charge an additional fee payable by the consumer. Contract
parking customers provide advance payments which contribute to revenue stability and a
favorable net working capital profile. We are responsible for providing car parking technology
at the site and all expenses relating to operating and maintaining the parking equipment during
the term of the lease, with minimal responsibility for the physical upkeep of the facility and as

##### 120

a result have limited capital expenditure obligations for maintenance of the facility. Our lease
contract business generated 76% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

- _Management contracts. Our management business represents the fees we receive for managing_
parking facilities under contracts with third parties including public authorities as well as
private landlords and other private entities. Under these contracts we also advise on driving
revenue and traffic to the site. We are responsible for running the parking operations and
providing the car parking technology, which is often purchased through us but paid and owned
by the client. We are incentivized to meet a fixed contractual service level for which we receive
a fixed management fee from our client, and may also receive additional incentive fees. We do
not pay rent to our client, and the clients benefit from the fees paid by customers parking their
cars at these locations (which they receive either directly or through us, but which we typically
do not recognize as revenue). At sites under management contracts, we focus on maximizing
operational efficiency and scale and do not bear the risk of reduced traffic volumes and make
limited to no capital investments. Our management contract business generated 24% of our
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our parking enforcement services (issuing penalty notices on private land and administering fines in
public spaces) help our clients increase parking compliance and safety and reduce abuse, over-stays and
unwanted parking. These services include the patrolling of parking facilities owned or leased by our
clients, the issuance and collection of parking fines, the management of debt collection and the provision
of impartial representation and appeals services. We offer our parking enforcement services mainly in
Germany, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. In the year
ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of €157 million, or 21.8% of our total revenue from
parking enforcement services.

We also provide an extended range of ancillary services, including traffic management, taxi
management, shuttle management, valet parking, trolley services, parking space monitoring, security
and cleaning, advertising space marketing, e-solutions such as online booking platforms, apps and
electronic payment methods, collection services to parking facility owners as well as 24/7 support and
advising property owners on commercial and technical asset management as well as, in certain
circumstances, the planning, financing, construction and operation of multi-storey car parks and parking
spaces.

In addition, we have recently introduced “APCOA Urban Hubs,” which expands our core business
through new partnerships with participants across the mobility, logistics, electrification and technology
sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the acceleration of the e-commerce penetration, on-demand
proximity services, proliferation of new mobility models and increased automation. These services
require substantial city-based infrastructure. Our APCOA Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with
dedicated parking areas that can be used for alternative services, such as the long-term and short-term
storage of goods, trans-shipping for trucks and electric bikes for last mile deliveries, fleet parking for
logistics companies, shared vehicle and other mobility services and EV charging stations for fleet and
micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. In addition, APCOA Urban Hubs offer fixed
infrastructure such as the installation of 5G antennas, solar panels and wind energy generation. Our
APCOA Urban Hubs typically require low capital expenditures from us as our partners usually bear the
cost of installation of any required infrastructure. We created APCOA Urban Hubs with the aim of
establishing a new business segment for the use of parking spaces by B2B partners initially with an
increasing B2C offering in the medium term. To date, we have opened 179 APCOA Urban Hubs
focusing primarily on Germany, Denmark and the United Kingdom. As the COVID-19 pandemic has
accelerated the need to find alternative uses for parking spaces, we expect that APCOA Urban Hubs
will be a substantial part of our business going forward, reducing risk by providing further
diversification of our revenue streams. We have recently signed contracts with significant participants
in this evolving market, in addition to pursuing a healthy pipeline of additional Urban Hubs
opportunities.

##### 121


-----

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was €720.6 million, our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted
EBITDA was €83.7 million and our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA was €99.3 million.

**Strengths**

We believe that we have several competitive advantages in the car park sector in Europe, including our
local market leadership positions, long-term contract revenues, resilient and diversified business profile,
advanced digital and technology systems, local density and efficient operations and a strong
management team.

**_Leading Parking Infrastructure Operator in Europe_**

We are one of the leading car park infrastructure operators in the European parking market. We operate
approximately 11,700 parking facilities, and have increased our parking facilities from 1.3 million in
2016 to over 1.6 million parking spaces as of March 31, 2021. We believe we have the leading or second
largest market share by number of parking spaces in each of our ten largest markets. Our leading
position helps provide strong brand value, which has allowed us to achieve above-market growth in
recent years in our key countries. Our well-developed operational capabilities provide us with a highly
scalable platform through which we can add additional facilities and services at a moderate incremental
cost. We have been able to efficiently consolidate other European parking operations by acquiring
smaller operators, including Real Estate Schaffhausen GmbH, Alpina Deutschland GmbH, OnePark
A/S, Security Park AS, Profectum AS, Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, Mobile
Research Solutions Limited and Xpert Parkering Sweden AB. We have a large presence in the top cities
by population in each of our markets, which leads to density-related synergies. Our pan-European
presence allows us to serve our clients across a wide range of European geographies and makes us a
partner of choice for key pan-European property owner and investor corporate accounts. We believe
that our attractive locations, digital offering with direct customer interactions and internal data on
frequencies and customer behavior help us drive favorable pricing.

We are able to use our scale to operate our car park portfolio in an efficient manner, which allows us to
realize synergies and also makes us an attractive partner for our clients. For example, our scale enables
us to share resources among our car parks (in particular, in clusters where we operate multiple parking
facilities in close proximity) including maintenance and supervisory staff, as well as management
resources in respect of parking customer service, client support, accounting, marketing, human
resources, insurance and tax matters. Due to our size and scale, we are better equipped to make
significant investments in IT and parking lot technology and to leverage such investments across our
operations compared to smaller competitors. Our information technology services cover the entire
parking customer experience from searching for and reserving a parking space through to navigating to
the parking garage, contactless entry and exit and electronic payment. In 2018 we launched our APCOA
FLOW platform, which is based on a central, open and scalable digital platform which connects the
vast majority of our leased parking garages, including parking technology, with its customers and their
vehicles via a cloud solution including smartphone apps. We are also in the process of upgrading our
APCOA Flow platform to provide real time data on occupancy and availability of our parking facilities,
thereby enabling us to better anticipate and predict customer demand. APCOA FLOW also provides us
with a direct channel to our end customers, allowing us to offer tailor-made products, differentiated
prices and convenience thereby increasing customer loyalty and frequency of use. These operational
efficiencies and incremental revenues generated through information technology initiatives and
investments allow us to offer a compelling product to customers and landlords. APCOA FLOW is also
a key element of our new APCOA Urban Hubs initiative.

**_Large and Structurally Attractive Growing Market_**

During 2018, the European parking market generated approximately €28 to 29 billion in revenues, with
approximately €11 to 12 billion spent on outsourcing parking management of which over €6 billion was
spent on off-street management in our top six markets. The European parking market grew by 4-5%
annually from 2013 to 2018, primarily as a result of new outsourcing, increased pricing and increased

##### 122


-----

volume through better utilization and new builds, in particular in larger cities. We expect that
outsourcing will continue to increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as clients seek to lower
their costs by partnering with operators like us who can provide economies of scale and provide
alternative uses such as through our APCOA Urban Hubs initiative. The countries in which we operate
have seen steady parking revenue growth and increasing personal car fleet levels over the past decade.
The large and growing car fleet in Europe included over 240 million vehicles in 2019. From 2013 to
2019, the number of passenger car registrations in Europe increased by between 12 and 15 million
vehicles per year. In 2020 this trend was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Summary—
_Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic.” The off-street parking industry in Europe is highly fragmented_
with a limited number of large players who have the scale to operate their business as efficiently as we
do.

Our client acquisition strategy is largely focused on first time outsourcing. We believe there is continued
strong outsourcing penetration potential in Europe, as currently approximately 50% of the European
parking market by revenue is run by business or property owners and not otherwise outsourced to
specialized parking operators. In addition, we believe that there will be continued growing demand for
outsourcing in parking due to the increased adoption of technologies, the increased consumer demand
for digital services, the increased level of sophistication required in yield management, increased budget
pressure on municipalities and the necessity to decrease costs through economies of scale.
Approximately 80% of our average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution from new business during 2018,
2019 and 2020 results from first time outsourcing.

We believe that off-street parking is expected to benefit from key trends in the industry, including, for
example: the regulatory shift away from on-street parking with reduced on-street parking provisions in
city centers, increasing prices of on-street parking and the introduction of electric cars, which require
EV charging spaces that off-street parking can offer. As a result, based on the market report prepared
by an international management consultant firm, outsourced parking consumer spend is expected to
grow at a CAGR of approximately 4% between 2018 and 2023.

-----

We also believe that parking facilities will benefit from the ongoing transformation of off-street car
park facilities into multi-modal urban hubs. We have focused on four case-use groups to increase our
revenue derived from urban hubs: mobility modality, new technology and services, logistics and
electrification. Modality improvements provide inter-modal and multi-modal transports from one
location. Ride share providers use parking facilities as hubs to provide these journeys, or rent shared
cars, electric scooters or bikes from these facilities. New technology and services involves integrating
proximity and community services from our locations through our digital platform. In addition, in
October 2020 we demonstrated, together with Bosch/Daimler, automated valet parking for vehicles
with autonomous driving capabilities at Stuttgart airport. Logistics services includes using urban
facilities as fulfillment centers for logistics, storage and distribution services, such as Amazon drop
boxes and overnight delivery package storage. Electrification includes providing connected charging
services for EVs, fleet and micro mobility like electric scooters and bikes. We currently provide
consumers access to over 2,000 third-party owned charging stations at our parking facilities, which is
being further expanded.

There are significant barriers to entry for new entrants in the car park industry in Europe, including
required investments in building the required operational know-how and digital infrastructure and the
economies of scale that result from achieving local density. In addition, our long-standing relationships
with our clients enable an ongoing dialogue with them as contracts approach renewal and provide us
with an opportunity to sign pre-emptive renewals usually involving upgrading the parking equipment
in return for a new long-term contract. Our focus on outsourcing, not ownership, allows us to develop
key accounts for whom we operate multiple locations across multiple geographies.

**_Diversified Portfolio with Long-Term Contract Base_**

Our business benefits from a portfolio of parking facilities and parking spaces which is highly
diversified in terms of the geographical distribution, number of contracts, type of contract, number of
clients, number of customers and types of customers we serve. Our parking facilities are diversified
across most of Europe and even our largest market (Germany) only represents approximately 33% of
our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution, with five other countries (Denmark, Italy, Sweden, the
United Kingdom and Norway) each contributing approximately 10% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract
Contribution in the year ended December 31, 2019. We cover parking facilities for a wide range of
business sectors, such as city and shopping, travel, healthcare & education, events and hospitality, and
parking enforcement. Furthermore, many of our parking facilities are typically not dedicated to a single
institution, business or purpose and are multi-functional, in the sense that they are used by motorists
that visit a variety of locations, whether for work, shopping, other cultural activities or other purposes.
We believe our limited reliance on any single geography, customer base or contract helps reduce our
cash flow volatility. Our top ten car parks represented 18% of our total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2019, while our largest car park represented less than 5% of our revenue during the same
period. We are highly selective when evaluating contract opportunities and we only provide such
services to the extent that they comply with our margin and profitability criteria.

We operate parking facilities under long-term leases with a typical initial duration of ten to fifteen years,
with an option to extend for another five to ten years mostly at our sole discretion and management
contracts with a typical duration of three to eight years. Our top 100 existing lease and management
contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December
31, 2019) have an average of approximately 12 years remaining. The average duration for our top 100
contracts (based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution) has increased from 23.5 years
in 2016 to 31.1 years in 2021. We have very low contract concentration, with over 5,900 contracts
across over 11,700 parking facilities. We typically have over 96% annual retention. In addition, on
average, contracts representing only 5% of our total Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year
ended December 31, 2019 are up for renewal in each of the next five years. We benefit from significant
revenue visibility in that more than 90% of our revenue typically comes from contracted car parks prior
to the start of any year and such contracted car parks typically provide a stable and predictable revenue
generation. We have a disciplined and proactive contract renewal framework to maximize retention
while safeguarding profitability.

##### 124


-----

We believe we are well-positioned for a recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic due to
the structure of our portfolio, which provides long-term revenue visibility. Furthermore, we continued
to invest in new businesses and acquire new contracts during the pandemic, securing new business
contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. As of
May 31, 2021, we valued our unweighted pipeline of new parking contracts at approximately €80
million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution. Our current unweighted pipeline of new contracts has
constantly remained high at approximately €75 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution since
January 2020 and over €65 million since the fourth quarter in 2018. We expect this to contribute
significantly to our portfolio, revenue and margin growth going forward once utilization levels recover
to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.

**_Asset-Light Business Model With a Flexible Cost Base and Optimal Return on Capital_**

We operate our clients’ parking assets through two business models: lease contracts and management
contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our operations under lease contracts generated 76%
of our revenues, and operations under our management contracts generated 24% of our revenues. In
each of these models, we run parking operations for our clients without incurring significant capital
expenditures and through an asset light approach that is flexible and scalable, because we operate the
facilities as opposed to owning them. Our asset light model benefits from an attractive payback period
of approximately one year on new business investments, mainly in parking and equipment technology.
Our long-term underlying contract structures provide visibility and stability and we seek to negotiate
for contractual flexibility in the event of material adverse changes on sites that are outside of our control.
For the facilities we operate under leases, we generate our fees based on tariffs charged directly to car
park users, which allows us to apply our yield management expertise to increase volumes and prices.
We have a balanced level of fixed lease costs (42% of fixed rent as a percentage of total rent in the year
ended December 31, 2019 on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) because most of our leases provide for a mix of fixed
and variable rent payments, the variable portion of which is based on the actual revenue earned by us
at the location subject to the lease. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 58% of our €345 million of
pre-IFRS 16 rent expense was variable rents. In the year ended December 31, 2020, when our business
was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the variable rents provided an immediate expense
buffer with our variable rent expense decreasing by €111 million compared to our original budgeted
variable rent expense for the period. In the year ended December 31, 2020, 46% of our pre-IFRS 16
rent expense was variable. The management fees charged by us under our management contracts
typically increase each year in line with inflation, and often include additional incentive fees depending
on the performance of the facility. Compared to the substantial decrease in our lease contract revenue
due the COVID-19 pandemic, our management contract revenue during the year ended December 31,
2020 only decreased by 10% compared to the previous year, as our clients continued to need our
services and were required to make payments despite lower parking volumes.

**_Strong Financial Profile, with Successful Management Execution resulting in Growth, Profitability_**
**_and High Cash Conversion_**

Our business model provides us with long-term cash flow visibility as a result of our strategic focus on
operating our facilities through long-term contracts, recurring business through seasonal parking
customers, parking playing a central role in the local economy as well as our ability to accurately
estimate our revenue and profitability and analyze trends in working capital and capital expenditure.
Our long-term cash flow visibility is furthered by the favorable and stable regulatory environment in
the markets in which we operate as well as by certain contractual protections for us in our lease and
management contracts.

Between 2015 and 2019, we achieved 20 quarters of consecutive year-on-year profit growth up to the
end of 2019 (measured on the basis of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution). Parking demand in a
particular market is typically correlated to the total size of the car fleet in that market (rather than GDP),
which enhances the stability of our revenues over long periods and helps provide resilience through
periods of economic downturn. Our revenue has benefitted from positive structural trends such as
increasing motor vehicle fleet in our markets, a move from on-street parking to off-street parking and

##### 125


-----

increasing levels of outsourcing, but it has also benefitted from the successful implementation of
strategic expansions by our management team, focusing on clients who outsource operations or
management of their parking facilities for the first time, and achieving high retention rates of typically
over 95% for the past five years. In addition, between 2015 and 2019, we increased our Pre-IFRS 16
Adjusted EBITDA profit margin from 8.8% to 11.6%, primarily as a result of the implementation of
cost savings and operational efficiency measures and better yield management through, for example,
dynamic pricing that we offer across 69 of our sites, all of which were implemented by our current
management team which joined in 2016 and early 2017. Our revenue increased at a CAGR of 2.3%
between 2016 and 2019, primarily driven by like-for-like growth and the acquisitions of OnePark A/S
and Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited, offset by the non-renewal of our contract with
Oslo Airport, which we decided not to pursue aggressively due to low margins. This like-for-like
revenue growth was driven by a combination of tariff increases, length of stay and volume management
across all core countries. In addition, between January 2019 and March 31, 2021, we completed five
bolt-on acquisitions with attractive synergies. We believe our scale, stability and industry experience
facilitates our ability to win new business, with a 75% win rate in 2020 for all contracts bid on.

Our management team has also implemented a differentiated approach to both our key pan-European
and local clients, which has resulted in an increase in the share of new business that is generated from
relationships with key accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 60% of our new
business was generated by key accounts, compared to 11% in 2016. We typically have separate
agreements for each of our facilities with our key accounts, with differing durations and renewal dates.
We believe we have strong relationships with our key accounts and that there is continued growth
potential. As of March 31, 2021, we had over 4,800 clients.

Our parking facilities, once operational, require relatively low levels of capital expenditures. Our
limited maintenance capital expenditures, which averaged less than 1% of revenue in the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are driven by the capital-light nature of our business. Our cash flow
generation benefits from an advantageous working capital cycle through the collection of upfront
payments (through season tickets) from our long-term parking customers and revenue collection
directly upon exit from a car park for our short-term parking customers. We implemented a net working
capital optimization program in 2017 aimed at extending supplier terms and payment cycles and
improving collection and payment processes. As a result of our low capital expenditure and working
capital requirements, we benefit from a high level of cash conversion and achieved an adjusted cash
conversion ratio of 92.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis. We
consistently increased our adjusted free cash flow (before expansion capital expenditures) from 2016
to 2019 by a CAGR of 30.4%.

We believe our growth prospects are further boosted by our new APCOA Urban Hubs initiatives as
well as new business wins, with €21 million of signed new parking business not yet fully reflected in
our Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Clear Strategy Targeting Low-Risk Growth Opportunities from Multiple Sources_**

We believe we are well positioned to continue expanding our business by targeting a diverse range of
low-risk growth opportunities across our traditional parking markets and expanding our new APCOA
Urban Hubs initiative.

We expect that demand for traditional parking across our sectors will continue to normalize as
vaccination programs are now well underway across all of our countries, with more than 50% of the
adult population in each of our top six countries having received at least one dose of the COVID-19
vaccine. Accordingly, we continue to monitor growth opportunities in this sector. In addition, despite
the difficult market environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we further expanded our contract
portfolio, winning new business contracts in 2020 equivalent to €13.2 million in annualized Pre-IFRS
16 Contract Contribution, which we expect will contribute to our portfolio growth going forward. We
will continue to make technological developments focused on improving service delivery and margins
in our traditional parking sectors, as well as further refine our pricing mechanisms in order to improve
yield. We believe our continued focus on key accounts, with whom we believe we have strong
relationships, and first time outsourcing differentiates us from our competitors and provides continued
growth potential.

We also believe there are growth opportunities in the less traditional parking markets. For example, we
plan to continue our expansion of our parking enforcement services in Scandinavia and roll out ANPRbased services in the rest of Europe for the retail and healthcare sectors in particular.

We also believe we are well positioned to continue growing through our new APCOA Urban Hubs
initiative, which expands our core business through new partnerships with participants across the

mobility, logistics, electrification and technology sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic led to the
acceleration of the e-commerce penetration, on-demand proximity services, proliferation of new
mobility models and increased automation. These services require substantial city-based infrastructure,
which we are ideally placed to provide at a lower cost than our partners could find for many other types
of infrastructure. Our APCOA Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with dedicated parking areas that
can be used for alternative services. Our wide network of parking facilities, proximity to consumers and
digital capabilities provide a strong asset to these partnerships.

**_Experienced Management Team_**

Our executive management and country management teams have significant experience and
understanding of the car park sector and have a combined experience of over 150 years in the industry,
of which the country management team has over 130 years of experience in the industry. Our executive
management team has focused on increasing revenues through creating a much wider contract pipeline
combined with a higher new project win rate, an increased retention rate, consistent like-for-like growth,
cost optimization and selective strategic acquisitions. We have increased our focus on managing
existing contracts efficiently and have implemented a reward-based culture that promotes excellence
among our local management teams. We have adopted a differentiated approach to pan-European and
local key accounts. As a result, from the year ended December 31, 2016 to the year ended December
31, 2019, our Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA increased at a CAGR of 9.5%. Our management team
has also sought to anticipate and embrace new trends and technology in the car park sector and uses for
our facilities, which has enabled us to be a pioneer in the deployment of efficient pricing, revenue
management, digitalization programs and user-friendly applications.

In addition, our local management teams are well connected to industry bodies and groups as well as
municipalities and maintain strong and long-standing local relationships with the relevant regulatory
authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We benefit from the extensive sector expertise of
our operational managers.

**Strategy**

Our key strategies are as follows:

**_Increase Like-for-Like Sales at our Existing Facilities_**

We plan to continue to seek to increase like-for-like growth at our existing facilities by increasing
volume, effectively managing pricing, creating a differentiated parking experience through digital
parking tools and targeted marketing campaigns. Dynamic pricing has developed as an important
instrument to optimize pricing and yield, and we plan to continue to refine our pricing mechanisms.
Depending on various factors such as day of the week, time of day, occupancy or specific space location
and size, parking tariffs can be dynamically adjusted at car park and specific space level. We plan to
continue to seek ways to manage demand at the individual car park level through efficient pricing as
we believe dynamic pricing offers significant revenue enhancement potential.

We plan to continue to implement measures that seek to create a seamless customer experience. We
have invested in ANPR and our APCOA FLOW mobile application, allowing frictionless and ticketless
entry, exit and payment. Besides automatic number plate recognition, customers can access our sites
through radio-frequency identification (“RFID”), Bluetooth or quick response (“QR”) codes. In
addition, we have installed several user-friendly information technology applications to enhance the
customer experience at our car parks, including electronic payment devices. We have installed cashless
and contactless payment mechanisms and have begun using differentiated parking tariffs based on
supply and demand. Over 3 million customers have downloaded our apps to benefit from this increased
convenience. We plan to continue to implement these initiatives at more of our parking facilities and to
continue to develop new ways to make our parking facilities more attractive to customers.

##### 128

In addition, at many of our facilities we have installed a robust infrastructure of charging facilities for
EVs. The installation and capital expenditure costs are usually covered by our partners, the revenues
from the sale of electricity is shared between us and our partners and we benefit from additional parking
tariffs. In Denmark and Sweden, customers can use our APCOA FLOW app to pay for the electricity
when charging their EVs at one of our facilities or across our partners’ networks, and we are in the
process of implementing this feature in Norway. We believe providing these services will increase
frequency at our sites by offering differentiated and environmentally-friendly services to customers who
own electric and hybrid vehicles, broadening our consumer base.

**_Retain Existing Clients and Grow New Business Pipeline_**

Our retention rates in 2019 and 2020 for our leases and management contracts were approximately 98%,
which shows the stability of our underlying business. We have adopted a differentiated approach to key
pan-European and local clients in order to ensure that we are retaining key accounts. We plan to seek
to continue to retain clients through forward-thinking account management and will continue to
proactively analyze our clients’ infrastructure to ensure we are addressing their needs.

Due to our market leading position, scale, high quality operations, competitive contract pricing and
smart technology offering, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our diversified
portfolio by capturing new contracts in value enhancing locations from both existing clients seeking to
award new contracts and from organizations looking to outsource the management of their parking
facilities, including first time outsourcers. Due to our scale, long-standing industry experience and local
density, we believe we are able to achieve significant synergies that allow us to offer competitive terms
and win new business. Our selection of facility locations is driven by our long-term strategy to operate
and expand in high margin locations and seek local density. Despite the effect of the COVID-19
pandemic on our business, in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the three months ended March 31,
2021 we signed new contracts which we estimate will contribute an aggregate amount of approximately
€53.6 million to our revenue and approximately €13.2 million to our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution
and approximately €14.8 million to our revenue and approximately €3.9 million to our Pre-IFRS 16
Contract Contribution, respectively. On average, the Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution margin of new
business won during 2020 is approximately 500bps above the existing core portfolio of contracts as of
2019. Our current unweighted pipeline of new contracts has constantly remained high at approximately
€75 million of Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution since January 2020 and over €65 million since the
fourth quarter in 2018.

We plan to expand our operations by capturing new opportunities that meet our stringent investment
criteria, including sites that enhance our pricing strategy through a resilient local competitive dynamic,
permit operational cost reductions given our ability to have a single work force servicing multiple
locations and maintain strong relationships with local landlords. In addition, we are often able to expand
our locations to further facilities once we have entered a local market by virtue of our existing
relationships with local landlords and the ability to benefit from synergies with existing parking
facilities. There is also a large opportunity in the transfer of unpaid parking to paid parking, mainly in
the retail space as well as in underused office and residential buildings. We will seek to grow
opportunities from first time outsourcing by persuading clients to launch paid parking, effectively
creating new markets.

We believe that we are able to serve a broader market of companies than most traditional operators due
to our focus on operating as opposed to owning the car parks. We believe that our focus on operations
allowed us to establish unique relationships with our large clients as, contrary to certain traditional
operators, we do not compete with our landlords for the purchase of available car park real estate. These
established relationships with private and municipal landlords allow us to be in a better position than
certain of our competitors to secure contracts relating to our landlords’ newly acquired car parks. In
addition, we have introduced a number of initiatives to expand our operations. For example, our
APCOA Urban Hubs initiative extends the use of the parking facilities we operate beyond the core
function of “parking,” providing alternative uses for parking spaces that are unused, such as short term
storage of goods, shared vehicle and other mobility services, EV charging stations and the installation

##### 129


-----

of 5G antennas. We plan to continue to seek to transform additional parking areas into urban hubs and
expect that APCOA Urban Hubs will be a substantial part of our business going forward.

We believe our position as one of the leading operators of parking facilities in Europe, combined with
our long-standing relationships with a diverse group of landlords and local authorities and favorable
industry dynamics, including high barriers to entry, as well as our new initiatives, will provide us with
a number of opportunities to grow our contract base and pipeline of new opportunities.

**_Continue to Seek Accretive Acquisition Opportunities_**

We plan to continue to selectively identify and target acquisition opportunities in order to increase our
scale. We believe there is still a high level of fragmentation in the European market for parking space
management. The majority of providers are local operators with fewer than 20 car parks. As a result,
we believe we have potential for growth through further consolidation. In 2020 we acquired Security
Park Group in Norway and Xpert Parkering in Sweden, with both businesses delivering a positive
EBITDA in 2020. We plan to continue to seek EBITDA enhancing, value accretive, highly synergistic
acquisitions.

**_Enhance Mobility Solutions and Partnerships_**

We are currently expanding our core business under the brand “APCOA Urban Hubs.” Through this
program, we seek to open up our physical and digital parking infrastructure to partners who are seeking
and are in need of city based infrastructure to support their operations or to deliver consumer based
services. Specifically, partners seek to use our parking areas for logistics, vehicle and other mobility,
electrification and new technology services. Examples include locker boards, logistics fleet parking and
EV charging stations, long-term storage and the installation of 5G antennas. What these services all
offer in common is that, by linking the physical infrastructure with the digital infrastructure, an
alternative use of the parking areas is enabled that extends beyond the core function of “parking.” We
believe that as a result of the trends of urbanization, new mobility and increasing e-commerce, our panEuropean network, comprising more than 11,700 parking facilities, offers great development potential
for our company and its partners. We will continue to seek to transform additional parking areas into
urban hubs.

**History**

APCOA was founded in 1949 in Ohio as the Airport Parking Company of America, Inc. In 1966, ITT
Corporation acquired the company. Subsequently, in 1970, APCOA Autoparking GmbH was founded
in Germany under ITT’s German division, beginning APCOA’s operations in Germany and Austria.
Over the next three decades, APCOA expanded across Europe, entering key markets such as the United
Kingdom (1981), Italy (1985), the Netherlands (1989), Poland (1998), and Belgium (1998). In 1991,
ITT Corporations spun off APCOA’s European operations in a management buy-out financed by
venture capital company CWB Capital Partners. In 1995, the Group listed on the Frankfurt, Düsseldorf
and Stuttgart Stock Exchanges. In 1999, a majority of the company’s shares were acquired by
Salamander AG. The same year the company entered the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish markets. In
2002, EnBW-AG purchased Salamander AG, and subsequently APCOA was delisted from the
Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2003.

In 2004, Investcorp acquired 98.3% of APCOA Parking AG’s shares from EnBW AG through its
Parking Holdings GmbH entity. In 2005, the company changed the name of Parking Holdings GmbH
to APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH. By the end of 2005, the company was delisted from the Düsseldorf
and Stuttgart Stock Exchanges. In 2007, Eurazeo acquired APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, and that
same year the company founded its subsidiary in Ireland.

In 2014, APCOA implemented a reorganization of its capital structure through a UK scheme of
arrangement, resulting in the Sponsor becoming the controlling shareholder of the Group.

**Our Services**

We provide our clients with a broad range of parking management services, parking enforcement
services and ancillary services.

**_Parking Management Services_**

Our parking management services focus on the operation of public and private parking spaces and
parking garages. We provide parking management services as either a leaseholder of the parking facility
or an owner- or leaseholder-appointed operator. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated
revenues of €720 million from parking management services.

_Lease Contracts_

Lease contracts are our largest contributor to our overall results, representing 76% of our revenue for
the year ended December 31, 2019.

We focus on leasing parking facilities in top-tier locations across urban areas and other areas of high
traffic density in Europe, such as city & shopping, healthcare & education, travel, and events and
hospitality. As of March 31, 2021, our diversified portfolio of parking facilities comprised
approximately 7,000 leased sites in 13 countries, providing for approximately 740,000 parking spaces.
Our lease contracts include a number of car parks with prime locations, such as Verona Cittadella and
Berlin Brandenburg Airport. Many of these locations are in highly transited areas that attract a large
number of visitors for a variety of purposes and have limited free or paid alternative parking options.

Through our lease contracts, we serve a diverse group of real estate owners and leaseholders, including
private individuals, family offices, institutional investors, pension funds and local authorities. Our
clients own or lease the parking facilities and partner with us for the provision of parking management
services.

Pursuant to our lease contracts, we are responsible for collecting the parking fees directly from
consumers and our revenue is equal to the consumer spend at the parking site. As a result, we seek to
maximize yield from the asset through pricing and volume initiatives. We collect parking fees from
consumers either on a time period basis for short-stay tickets (such as per-hour or per-day tickets) or on
a monthly, quarterly, seasonal or annual basis pursuant to subscription agreements. In the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, we generated short-term revenues of €356 million, or 53% of total
revenue, €383 million, or 53% of total revenue, and €222 million, or 42% of total revenue, respectively,
and contract parking revenues of €81 million, or 12% of total revenue, €82 million, or 11% of total
revenue, and €87 million, or 16% of total revenue, respectively. We usually have full pricing autonomy
at our parking facilities, except for certain locations such as airports and shopping centers. We generally
determine parking fees based on supply and demand at individual parking locations, taking into account
the local competitive environment. In return, we pay rent to the owner of lessor of the asset on a
monthly, quarterly or annual basis.

We offer our clients a variety of lease contracts, including fixed rent, which provides for fixed rent
payments that are set independently of the revenue generated at the parking facility, variable rent, which
provides for variable rent payments that depend on the amount of revenue generated at the parking
facility, or a mixture thereof. Fixed rent typically includes rent adjustment clauses that are linked to the
consumer price index or similar benchmark indices. For the year ending December 31, 2019, 42% of
our rents were fixed and 58% of our rent were variable (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis).

Our lease agreements usually have an initial duration of ten to fifteen years, with an option to extend
for another five to ten years mostly in our sole discretion. Typically, our leases include several downside
protection mechanisms, such variable rent arrangements, rent adjustments related to key frequency
drivers (such as the anchor tenant, tenancy percentages of shopping centers, etc.) or related to traffic
restrictions (such as roadwork, renovation work in garages, diesel/car ban, congestion/tolling, etc.), and

##### 131


-----

termination rights in case of revenue dropping below a certain threshold. In addition, additional costs,
including for energy, taxes and maintenance, are typically capped.

Under our lease agreements, we frequently provide, pay for and own, the car parking technology, such
as barrier systems and payment machines, and are responsible for running the parking operations at our
client’s facilities. In addition, we are responsible for all site-related operating expenses, such as
personnel expenses, cost of materials and other operating expenses as well as any site-related capital
expenditures. Our leasing model requires minimal capital investment, which is mainly spent on parking
technology. Our lease agreements have a typical capital expenditure payback period of one to two years.

We typically operate our parking facilities on a 24-hour a day/seven-day a week basis. Most of the
features of our parking facilities are automated, including entry and exit controls and ticket machines.
Consumers can obtain information about subscriptions and tariffs online, over the phone and onsite at
our parking facilities as well as through our digital offering APCOA FLOW. In addition, consumers
can pre-book parking spaces through our websites. We staff and operate parking facilities subject to
lease contracts with our own employees. Upon request from our clients, we also assist with site
development during the building phase as well as the preparation of site operating concepts with
individual tariffs and on-site support following thorough location analysis.

_Management Contracts_

Management contracts represented 24% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Through our management contracts we provide parking management services to clients who view
parking as a key driver of their core business and want to retain pricing autonomy over the site owned
or leased by them, such as airports, local authorities, shopping centers and hospitals. By using our
services, our clients can achieve higher service quality for consumers and lower operational expenditure
due to benefits of scale that come from engaging a dedicated parking operator.

In a typical management contract, our client owns the parking facility, makes the strategic decisions on
tariff policies and quality control, and benefits from the income and service generated through the
parking operations managed by us. We are responsible for running the parking operations, advising the
client on how to drive revenue and providing the car parking technology, which is often purchased
through us but paid and owned by the client. In exchange for our services, we receive a management
fee, which is intended to cover our costs for running a site, in addition to a fee for managing the site,
and is regularly adjusted based on the consumer price index or similar benchmark indices, such as the
London Living Wage, and not subject to parking volumes or consumer spend. In some cases, the
contracts also include a variable incentive fee element based on the amount of revenue generated and
certain other quality indicators.

Pursuant to our management contracts, the owner or lessor of the parking facility is responsible for all
site-related capital expenditures while we are responsible for operating expenses, such as personnel
expenses, cost of materials and other operating expenses. We typically operate the parking facility with
our own employees. Our management contracts require limited or no capital investment.

Our management contracts generally have a duration of three to eight years and include certain
downside protection mechanisms, such as grace periods in case of strikes, regular fee increases
generally linked to the consumer price index benchmark indices, such as London Living Wage, and no
or only very low penalties, with the total penalty amount generally lower than Contract Contribution.

As of March 31, 2021, our management contract portfolio included approximately 4,700 parking
facilities covering approximately 830,000 parking spaces.

##### 132


-----

**_Parking Enforcement Services_**

We offer parking enforcement services to help our clients increase parking compliance and safety and
reduce abuse, over-stays and unwanted parking. These services include the patrolling of parking
facilities owned or leased by our clients, the issuance and collection of parking fines, the management
of bailiffs and the provision of impartial representation and appeals services.

Our parking enforcement services include on-street enforcement for public roads (“On-Street” services)
as well as park and control (“PAC”) or park and guard (“Park & Guard”) services for privately owned
parking facilities. Our clients include local authorities, private parking companies and property owners,
such as restaurants, retailers, hotel chains, and hospitals. In the case of “On-Street” services, the
consumer pays any fines directly to the municipality and we receive a management fee from the owner
of the parking facility. With these contracts, we do not recognize the value of any control fees issued in
our own account. In the case of PAC and Park & Guard parking enforcement services, we collect
parking control fees directly from the consumer and we subsequently may pay a portion of the fees
collected to the site owner. We offer our parking enforcement services mainly in Germany, Austria,
Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland and the United Kingdom. In particular, our PAC services
in Germany and Austria has increased from generating less than €4 million of our revenue in 2016 to
€20 million of our revenue in 2019.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated revenues of €157 million from parking enforcement
services.

**_Ancillary Services_**

In addition to parking management services and parking enforcement services, we also provide our
clients with an extended range of ancillary services, including valet parking, traffic and taxi
management through our Traffic Management System, trolley management, e-business solutions such
as car park reservation systems (including parking pre-booking, contract parking management systems,
online ticket sales and online marketing measures), advertising space marketing, parking space
monitoring, and security and cleaning services. We also offer consultancy services, whereby we provide
support to landlords and real estate owners by offering advice on conception and planning, marketing
and PR recommendations, design and technology issues, as well as market analysis of customer profiles
and demand. Our support begins as early as the planning phase for new constructions and renovations.
We also conduct feasibility studies to determine the profitability of the project and provide and deal
with the authorities, optimizing processes for architects, developers and planners.

In the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated €57.7 million of our total revenues from ancillary
services.

**Our Sectors**

We provide our services across five sectors: (i) City & Shopping, (ii) Travel, (iii) Healthcare &
Education, (iv) Events & Hospitality and (v) Parking Enforcement, which include our Park & Control
(PAC), Park & Guard and “On-Street” parking enforcement services.

Our clients in the City and Shopping sectors include municipalities, owners and operators of shopping
centers and other retail outlets, investors in office space and other infrastructure. Many of our parking
facilities are typically not dedicated to a single institution or purpose and are multi-functional, in the
sense that they are used by motorists that visit a variety of locations, whether it is for work, shopping,
cultural activities or other purposes. Within our locations we are focused on building local density that
allows us to reduce operational costs given our ability to have a single task force servicing multiple
locations. Many of our rent agreements in the City and Shopping sector include downside protection
mechanisms, related to key frequency drivers (such as the anchor tenant, tenancy percentages of
shopping centers, etc.) or related to traffic restrictions (such as roadwork, renovation work in garages,
diesel/car ban, congestion/tolling, etc.).

##### 133


-----

Our clients in the Travel sector mainly include governments and owners and operators of airports and
railway stations. Several of our airport contracts include ancillary services such as taxi management,
shuttle management, valet parking, trolley services, parking space monitoring, security and cleaning
services. We have long-standing and strong relationships with our key clients in the airport segment.
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic most of our landlords have agreed to waive any guaranteed
minimum rents in our airport lease contracts, thereby making them fully variable rents and thus
providing downside protection in the face of reduced travel volumes throughout the pandemic. In a
number of locations, our landlords also reduced the variable rent percentages. Our management
contracts in the Travel sector have continued to operate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, although
some have required lower levels of manpower to service them, resulting in lower management contract
cost recharges to the client, and therefore lower revenues for APCOA, whilst limiting the impact on our
Contract Contribution.

Our clients in the Healthcare & Education sector include public and private hospitals as well as
universities. Many clients in this sector consider parking to be an important service to offer to their
visitors in addition to an important revenue generator for them. As such, we operate a mixture of both
lease and management contracts, depending on the client’s requirements and our view of the risk profile
of a contract. Our healthcare sites are usually characterized by limited available spaces with different
customers to be served: staff, patients and visitors. The efficient management of these customers flows
requires increasingly digital technology. Similarly in the Education sector there is a mix of teaching and
other staff, students and visitors, again with limited spaces that require careful management. Particularly
in the Healthcare sector we increasingly help the hospitals to expand parking capacity by planning and
coordinating the building of new facilities which we then manage through contracts with a duration of
over 15 years. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, revenues in this sector have remained more
resilient than other sectors, as healthcare centers in particular remained open and continued to have high
level of car park users (such as for their staff).

Our clients in the Events & Hospitality sector include operators of exhibition and event venues and
hotels (including both sporting and cultural venues). Parking revenues in this sector are highly
dependent on the number of events held or visitors to these locations and our contract and rent structures
reflect the characteristics of each location. Events require substantial ad hoc resources when large scale
events take place, such as the International Mobility Show in Germany or football matches at the
Wembley Stadium in the United Kingdom. We provide these ad hoc resources, organize the car flow,
provide the parking equipment and drive revenue which is largely pre-booked.

**Our Geographies**

We operate our business in 13 countries across Europe. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top
six key markets (comprising Germany, Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Norway, and the United Kingdom)
generated 84% of our Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution.

##### 135


-----

**_United Kingdom_**

Headquartered in Uxbridge. As of March 31, 2021, we operated approximately 750 parking facilities
providing for approximately 275,000 parking spaces. Key clients for our parking management services
in the United Kingdom include Heathrow Airport, Network Rail and Northwick Park Hospital.

As of March 31, 2021, 6.9% and 93.1% of our contracts in the United Kingdom constituted lease
contracts and management contracts, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our operations
in United Kingdom generated 7% of our Contract Contribution.

**New Business**

Between January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2021, we signed new contracts which we estimate will contribute
an aggregate amount of approximately €246 million to our revenue and approximately €41 million to
our EBITDA on a Pre-IFRS basis. On average, the Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution margin of new
business won during 2020 is approximately 500bps above the existing core portfolio of contracts. The
average payback period on new business investments amounts to approximately one year.

In our City and Shopping sectors, we added the Im Klapperhof property in central Cologne, one location
in Amsterdam and two shopping centers in Norway. In our Travel sector, we started operations at the
new Berlin airport. In the Events & Hospitality sector, we signed new contracts for the operation of the
car park of the future SportsDome in Hamburg’s HafenCity as well as the Gdansk zoo. In our Healthcare
sector, we concluded agreements for the operation of the car parks at the University Hospital in Aalborg,
Denmark, the municipal hospital in Braunschweig, the University Hospital in Hull and East Yorkshire
as well as an extension for the NHS Northwick Park hospital in the United Kingdom. New contracts for
our parking enforcement services activities include the addition of 229 locations with the Rewe Group
in Austria, the successful tender for the municipality of Monte Argentario in Italy as well as the
successful tender for parking enforcement services in the city of Diest, Belgium

Our approach to new business starts by screening across databases, construction archives or trade fairs,
using our detailed business opportunities database on our group-wide CRM platform in order to find
new contract opportunities. We then identify key accounts, both at a pan-European and at the local
level. Sites are carefully selected based on their capacity to generate long-term revenue with limited
risks around accessibility or negative regulation. We seek to constantly expand our specific city
footprint as this drives efficiencies, increases consumer relevance and provides for pricing
opportunities. Our contractual framework seeks to protect us from unexpected volume downturns and
to provide us with tariff freedom. The higher the quality of the sites the better the conditions we can
offer to our clients. We use a differentiated commercial proposition for each sector and our sales
leadership and expertise is driven by commercial asset management studies and site acquisition
consulting and support. We generally incur limited capital expenditures in connection with entering into
new contracts, which on average have a pay-back period of one year.

In order to identify new outsourcing opportunities, we have doubled our sales force between 2016 and
2019. As of March 31, 2021, our sales force included 75 full-time equivalents (“FTEs”) across all
regions. Our sales team is further divided into “Hunters” (58 FTEs), responsible for the identification
of new outsourcing opportunities, and “Farmers” (17 FTEs), key account managers responsible for
cultivating long-standing relationship with major landlords.

**Digital Solutions**

Since 2016, we have invested more than €36.1 million in digital initiatives to enhance our digital
capabilities and provide our clients and customers with a differentiated and individualized parking
experience. We believe these digital initiatives will help generate new revenue opportunities, increase
customer frequency and enhance customer loyalty. Our key digital initiatives include digital marketing,
online pre-booking, automatic number plate recognition, new partnerships across the broader

##### 136

automotive landscape, developing our APCOA FLOW platform and investing in new parking and
service concepts.

**_Digital Marketing_**

We continue to optimize our website in order to increase web visits and are working to increase our
presence online, such as by optimizing our presence on Google Maps and Waze. Through our digital
marketing initiatives we also aim to increase our presence across various social media platforms, such
as Facebook. In addition, we use Google’s advertising services to promote contract parking at our sites.

**_Online Sales and Pre-Booking_**

Through our online platforms, consumers can pre-book parking spaces and purchase long-term tickets
online at a variety of airports, city centers, rail stations and shopping center car parks. Between 2015
and 2019, the number of online pre-bookings more than tripled. We incentivize consumers to use our
pre-booking services by providing consumers with rewards and benefits by using such services,
including discounts and exclusive offers. In addition, consumers who sign up for pre-booking services
can receive regular discounts and promotions from their favorite stores and brands.

**_APCOA FLOW_**

Launched in 2018 in Germany, our APCOA FLOW mobile app connects parking and mobility and is
available on both Google and Apple iOS devices. It provides consumers a seamless parking experience
by, among other things, automatically identifying and guiding motorists to the most convenient car park
for their final destination, telling motorists how many spaces to park are available, allowing them to
seamlessly enter and exit car parks without paper tickets through Radio-Frequency Identification
(“RFID”) and ANPR technologies that automatically recognize every individual vehicle or driver, and
enabling automatic payments. We continually expand our digital platform and are looking to add future
enhancements to our mobile app, including the ability to reserve and book parking spaces in advance,
and connect barrier-free car parks and fee-based on-street parking. In addition, we use our APCOA
FLOW mobile app as part of our APCOA Urban Hubs brand. See “—APCOA Urban Hubs.” Our
APCOA FLOW mobile app works with existing barrier technologies, meaning it is cost-effective to
implement, without needing to purchase a new parking system.

As of March 31, 2021, over 75% of our paid parking facilities in the countries where APCOA FLOW
is operational were connected to the APCOA FLOW or Connect mobile apps. Our APCOA FLOW
mobile app is currently available for download in Germany, Italy, Sweden, Austria, Poland, Denmark,
Norway, Belgium and the Netherlands. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, a similar offering continues
to exists under the APCOA Connect brand, which was launched in those countries in 2012 and 2016,
respectively. Over 4,900 of our sites are accessible through APCOA FLOW and APCOA Connect and
this number is expanding every year.

We believe that our APCOA FLOW mobile app allows car park operators to forge deeper and more
personal relationships with consumers, resulting in a more personalized parking experience and
increased loyalty, which in turn drives volumes and revenue generation. For the year ended December
31, 2020, approximately 5% of our revenue was transacted through our app, and as of March 31, 2021,
APCOA FLOW and APCOA Connect had over 4.6 million registered users.

**_APCOA Urban Hubs_**

Under our brand “APCOA Urban Hubs,” we are currently expanding our core business through new
partnerships with participants across the mobility, logistics and electrification industries. Our APCOA
Urban Hubs offer this infrastructure with dedicated parking areas that can be used for alternative
services, such as the short-term storage of goods, transhipping from trucks to EV bikes for last mile
delivery, parcel lockers, long-term storage for consumers, fleet parking for logistic companies, COVID19 test centers, food delivery, shared mobility services, and e-charging stations, as well as fixed

infrastructure such as the installation of 5G antennas, solar panels and wind energy generation. Our
APCOA FLOW digital platform enables reservation, contactless access and automatic billing for the
use of the physical infrastructure. Examples of our Urban Hubs include a joint mobility hub with
Berlin’s public transport companies, where various sharing offerings from mobility service providers
are available, a Stuttgart parking garage which is used by a logistics service provider as a temporary
warehouse for the distribution by electric tricycles of goods on the last mile within the city center, as
well as the demonstration of the first garage for automated valet parking at Stuttgart airport. In addition,
through concessions with industrial partners such as E.ON in Germany as well as our own investments,
we are in the process of expanding our offering of currently 2,000 electric charging stations across our
operations. As part of our offering of electric charging stations, we also sell electricity to consumers.

To date, we have opened 179 APCOA Urban Hubs focusing primarily on Germany, Denmark and the
United Kingdom. We believe the pipeline of potential APCOA Urban Hubs business is worth €36
million of Contract Contribution (which is in addition to the parking pipeline).

**Information Technology**

Our information technology (“IT”) system operates on the basis of a decentralized model with a groupwide governance framework. Our group-wide IT team sets group level standards and our digital strategy
while local IT teams are responsible for system implementation and data management. In general, local
country IT organizations enjoy a level of autonomy and flexibility that enables them to be highly
responsive to local market needs. We generally aim to outsource risk of commodity IT operations and
services while focusing on value-driven core business IT functions, resulting in an overall lean
architecture.

Our APCOA FLOW digital parking platform (for navigation, access, parking, and payment) is our
major digital innovation. In connection with our APCOA FLOW app, we have partnered with a
specialist company, AGILE Parking Solutions, to develop, operate and maintain the FLOW platform.
The goal is to standardize all countries on the platform.

**Property**

As of March 31, 2021, we had leasehold interests in 84 offices across the 13 jurisdictions in which we
operate, with a total annual rent commitment (including utilities and incidentals) of approximately €5.4
million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Intellectual Property**

We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio which consists primarily of trademarks, designs
and domain names. We also have three patent applications in Italy in relation to specific systems for
managing car parks. Our key trademarks include APCOA, APCOA FLOW, APCOA Parking, Park &
Control and EuroPark. As of March 31, 2021, we had 313 domains which we actively monitored. In
addition, APCOA Parking UK’s IP portfolio includes a proprietary ANPR system and car park space
pre-booking software.

In addition, pursuant to an Indian law governed shareholder’s agreement dated August 11, 2017, we
have entered into a joint venture with and acquired a stake in AGILE Parking to develop the technology
used as part of the APCOA FLOW service. The joint development agreement with AGILE Parking
contains broad exclusivity provisions, which restrict the Group’s ability to carry out parking operations
in South Asia, Taiwan and South East Asia. The arrangement also involves two licensing agreements
which address the ownership and ongoing use of both background and foreground IP and pursuant to
which we are granted a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sub-licensable and royalty free license to the
IP developed under the Joint Development Agreement.

##### 138


-----

**Joint Ventures**

In certain jurisdictions, including Belgium, Switzerland and India, we have entered into joint ventures
to operate certain of our sites. Our joint ventures include ParcBrux in Belgium, APCOA Parking
Switzerland in Switzerland and AGILE Parking Solutions in India. Our key joint venture is ParcBrux
BV in Belgium, which we established together with another parking facilities operator in 2019.
ParcBrux BV is responsible for managing parking facilities in the Brussels metropolitan area.

**Suppliers**

We regularly engage with various suppliers of parking infrastructure equipment and parking
management systems, such as Skidata, Flowbird and Scheidt & Bachmann, and information
technology. We generally manage our procurement on a local basis and we believe that we do not
materially depend on any single supplier.

**Our Clients**

Our clients are the contractual counterparties with whom we enter into lease or management
agreements. Key clients include municipalities such as Stockholm, Southwark council and the city of
Palermo, hospital chains such as Locum Hospitals in Sweden, semi-public entities such as First Great
Western Trains and Heathrow airport in the UK, and private companies such as Primevest, the panEuropean property investor. We manage our relationships with these counterparties on a centralized
and local basis.

We believe we have a diversified client base, with no client accounting for more than 5% of our revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2019. In addition, our top five and top ten car parks accounted for
13% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The below chart shows our contract concentration based on revenue for the year ended December 31,
2019:

Our business benefits from a high contract contribution retention rate, which was 93%, 98%, 98% and
99% in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and the twelve months ended March 31,
2021, respectively. At the same time, none of our top five and only one of our top 20 clients have been
with us for less than ten years, with an average across the top 20 of approximately 19 years. As of March
31, 2021, our average expected contract life (including APCOA extensions) for our top 100 contracts
(based on weighted average Pre-IFRS 16 Contract Contribution for the year ended December 31, 2019)
was approximately 31 years with an average remaining life of approximately 12 years. Only four out of
the top 20 contracts are up for renewal before the end of 2026, providing us significant revenue
visibility.

**Environmental, Safety and Governance**

As a company involved in traffic and car park management, we believe it is our responsibility to grow
and develop as a company in innovative, responsible, and sustainable ways. We have several
environmental initiatives in place and in progress, mainly around energy consumption, and have
received five ISO 14001 certificates and have specific environmental trainings in two of the countries
in which we operate. On the social front, we serve cities, generally have very good labor relations and
aim to have a diverse and inclusive employee base. In addition, over the last year we have improved
our governance program. Going forward, we plan to institutionalize reporting and set-up ESG
communications; clearly define our ESG statement and our overarching targets; and document our
current achievements and implement evident best practices.

Below is a summary of the various environmental, safety and governance initiatives we have taken in
recent year.

**_Environmental Initiatives_**

We are committed to invest our knowledge and resources in lessening the adverse effects of heavy
traffic on our roads. We work closely with navigation system companies to reduce congestion in major
cities, which is often caused by motorists looking for a parking space. In addition, we provide clear,
consistent signage to direct motorists quickly to APCOA managed car parks.

We are also committed to encouraging, developing and implementing new technologies for pollution
reduction. Our car park concepts can help reduce CO2, smog and noise emissions in the inner-city areas
through innovative technological solutions and careful planning. To this end, we have installed electric
car charging bays in many of the car parks we manage. In addition, by outfitting our car parks with the
latest technology, we have been able to replace traditional pay stations and barriers at most of our sites
with new digital options that improve efficiency and reduce paper waste by doing away with traditional
parking tickets. We have also helped to develop low CO2 shuttle buses at major international airports,
including London Heathrow, and bring down environmental impact through our car park management
operational procedures. Our plan to achieve CO2 neutrality in the future consists of prioritizing
sustainability and analyzing the status quo, setting up teams and targets, creating and implementing an
action plan to reduce our carbon footprint, supporting climate projects to compensate for emissions we
cannot reduce, and communicate our achievements.

We are increasingly converting our own fleet to hybrid or fully electric. We have subscribed to the
EV100 initiative on a group level and have over the last five years converted the majority of our leased
car parks to LED lightning. We use LED lighting and proximity sensors on ticket machines to reduce
power use in the car parks we manage. We also install solar panels on the roofs of major multi-storey
car parks, including at Stuttgart Airport, and feed surplus generated energy back into the national grid.
Over 1,500 (or 13%) of our sites are powered by green energy. We estimate that there is a potential for
emission reduction of over 40% with the change to green energy.

We partner with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and utility companies to provide
electrical charging stations across our car parks and currently operate 2,000 charging stations across our
sites. Our APCOA Urban Hubs initiative will also help to substantially decrease the footprint of our
logistics partners and will see a rapid expansion of our EV charging facilities. Currently 1,200 (or 10%)
of our sites have EV charging facilities, with over 2,300 EV chargers throughout our parking facilities
network. In addition, 53 of the 900 cars in our fleet are EVs.

**_Health and Safety_**

We continuously strive to ensure that health and safety is at the forefront of everything we do, with
particular emphasis on how we can improve the working conditions of our employees through best
practice and common sense policy implementation.

##### 140


-----

**_Our People_**

We care about corporate social responsibility and sustainability that can be measured by the people who
use, supply and benefit from our services. We are proud to employ a diverse range of people, from all
walks of life. We continue to carry out voluntary diversity monitoring to ensure that each place of work
represents the local community it serves. For many years the parking industry has traditionally struggled
to balance gender, with men across all job levels having much higher rates of recruitment than that of
their female counterparts. We have focused on the type of employment we offer and providing more
flexible working opportunities has seen the year on year increase of female employees continue in a
positive trend. We also offer special assistance to young mothers and differently abled and elderly
people, and in some of the countries we operate we have established apprenticeship and training
programs for our employees.

We employ a very diverse employee pool and aim to increase the diversity with every new hire. At the
head office, out of 52 employees, 38% are female and 62% are male, and collectively they hold over 15
nationalities. We have a very strong governance program with obligatory on-line and monitored training
program around compliance.

**Employees**

The following table provides an overview of our FTEs as of March 31, 2021:

**As of March 31,**

**2021**
Workers ............................................................................................................................... 3,622
Employees ........................................................................................................................... 331
Management ........................................................................................................................ 26
**Total ....................................................................................................................................** **3,980**

In certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate there are employee representation bodies in place,
such as works council and/or collective bargaining agreements, including in Austria, Denmark, Norway,
Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom. We believe that our relations with employees are
satisfactory. In the last three years, we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages that have
had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

**Insurance**

We purchase comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that can occur at the parking
facilities that we operate, including, among others, product liability, property damage, business
interruption, cyber liability, and vehicle liability. As is customary, these policies have deductibles that
must be paid before the insurance companies are required to reimburse us for costs and liabilities
relating to covered claims. We also have directors’ and officers’ insurance as well as life and personal
insurance for our employees. We believe that our insurance coverage, including the maximum coverage
amounts and terms and conditions of the insurance policies, are both standard for our industry and
appropriate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our insurance coverage
_may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our insurance costs may_
_increase.”_

**Regulation**

Our operations are subject to various applicable local regulations, including regulations on parking
tariffs, parking enforcement, planning permissions (such as number of spaces that must be used for
certain contracts or planning permissions needed for our APCOA Urban Hubs), environment and safety,
which may have to be complied with when operating a parking facility. In addition, in all of our markets,
contracts with municipalities and other public authorities are subject to public tendering processes,
which require us to comply with the relevant legislation applicable to such tenders.

##### 141


-----

**Legal Proceedings**

We are subject to litigation from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, such as with our
landlords in regards to repair obligations and other provisions of our leases. See “Risk Factors—Risk
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal_
_proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could materially_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition,” “Risk Factors—Risk_
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—We may face complaints or litigation from season ticket holders_
_with respect to our long-term parking facilities,” “Risk Factors—Risk Relating to Our Business and_
_Industry—Instances of theft, fraud, bribery, corruption and privacy breaches involving our_
_management, employees, business partners or agents could expose us to penalties and reputational_
_damage and could hinder our ability to acquire or renew contracts or even continue our operating_
_activities” and “Risk Factors—Risk Relating to Our Business and Industry—We conduct business in_
_multiple jurisdictions and are exposed to changes in tax laws, tax rates and their application and_
_interpretation in the markets in which we operate, and we have been (and may continue to be) subject_
_to significant claims related to tax disputes and audits.” Although our legal and financial liability with_
respect to such proceedings cannot be estimated with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of
these legal proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition or results of operations.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (in addition to other permissions under the
limitation on indebtedness covenant) the ability (without double counting against the limitation on
indebtedness covenant) to incur additional indebtedness (including under one or more uncommitted
additional facilities within the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and/or any additional notes
and/or other facilities or notes documented outside the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) up
to (after taking into account the commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility) an aggregate
amount of the greater of €100.0 million and 100% of LTM EBITDA (as defined in “Description of the
_Notes” and subject to certain customary additions including the amount of prepayments and buy-backs)._

**_Availability_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility may be utilized from (and including) the date of the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement to (and including) the date falling thirty (30) days prior to the termination
date of the New Revolving Credit Facility.

##### 149

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilizations of the New Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to
EURIBOR (in respect of Loans denominated in euro), SONIA (in respect of Loans denominated in
Sterling) or LIBOR (in respect of Loans denominated in a currency other than euro or sterling), plus an
applicable margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio
of consolidated senior secured net debt to consolidated pro forma EBITDA (the “Senior Secured Net
Leverage Ratio”).

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
the New Revolving Credit Facility. If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in
respect of loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility. If SONIA is less than zero, SONIA
shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the New
Revolving Credit Facility from (and including) the date on which the New Revolving Credit Facility is
first utilised to (and including) the last day of the availability period applicable to the New Revolving
Credit Facility at a rate of thirty (30) per cent. of the applicable margin for the New Revolving Credit
Facility. Such commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of the availability
period applicable to the New Revolving Credit Facility and on the date the New Revolving Credit
Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the relevant lender cancels its commitment.

Any letter of credit or bank guarantee issued under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be subject
to such issuing bank and fronting fees as may be agreed between the Issuer and the applicable issuing
bank and a letter of credit or bank guarantee fee equal to the margin that would have been applicable to
a cash drawn under the New Revolving Credit Facility in the applicable currency.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the last day of the interest period
relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under the New
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the termination date of the Revolving Credit Facility, being
the date falling sixty (60) months after the issue date of the Notes (the “Closing Date”) or, if later, the
date falling six (6) months prior to the final maturity date of the Notes. Amounts repaid by the borrowers
on loans made under the New Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed, subject to certain
conditions.

In respect of the letters of credit, each will be repaid on the termination date of the New Revolving
Credit Facility, being the date falling sixty (60) months from the Closing Date or, if later, the date falling
six (6) months prior to the final maturity date of the Notes, provided that if any letter of credit has an
expiry date ending on or after the termination date applicable to the New Revolving Credit Facility, on
such termination date each letter of credit shall be repaid unless the relevant issuing bank agrees that
such letter of credit shall continue as between that issuing bank and the relevant member of the Senior
Secured Group on a bilateral basis and not as part of or under the documentation for the New Revolving
Credit Facility.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement allows for voluntary prepayments (subject to de minimis
amounts). The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also permits each lender to require the
mandatory prepayment of all amounts due to that lender upon a “Change of Control.”

##### 150

A “Change of Control” for the purposes of the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be defined as per
the Notes, including a change of control with respect to Topco ceasing to own 100% of the shares in
the Issuer (or any successor entity as a result of the merger of the Issuer).

**_Guarantees and Security_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by each Guarantor on a joint and several basis.

The New Revolving Credit Facility will be secured by the same security interests as for the Notes as set
forth under “Description of the Notes—Security.” The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will
provide that material subsidiaries will guarantee the New Revolving Credit Facility.

Subject to certain adjustments and the agreed security principles that apply to the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Issuer is required to ensure that members of the Group that (x) are material
subsidiaries (wholly owned members of the Group representing more than five (5) per cent. of
Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”)) and/or (y)
collectively contribute in aggregate at least eighty (80) per cent. of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined
in the section entitled “Description of the Notes”) are guarantors of the New Revolving Credit Facility
(i) on the date which is one hundred and twenty (120) days from (and excluding) the Closing Date; and
(ii) thereafter on the date when the annual financial statements of the Issuer are required to be delivered
to the agent in connection with the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (and, to the extent such
requirement is not satisfied on such date, the Issuer shall ensure that it is so satisfied within ninety (90)
days of such date).

The provision and the terms of the security and guarantees set forth above will in all cases be subject to
certain limitations and are at all times and in all cases subject to the requirements of applicable law and
the other matters set forth in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

**_Representations and Warranties_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain representations and warranties (subject
to certain agreed qualifications and with certain representations being repeated), including: (i) status,
binding obligations, non-conflict with other obligations, power and authority, governing law and
enforcement and validity and admissibility in evidence; (ii) no insolvency and no default; (iii) taxation;
(iv) base case model; (v) no proceedings pending or threatened; (vi) ranking; (vii) good title to assets;
and (viii) centre of main interests; (ix) financial statements; and (x) compliance with sanction, antibribery and anti-corruption laws.

Certain representations and warranties will be made on the date of the Agreement and the date of first
utilization and will be repeated on the date of each subsequent utilization, on the first day of each interest
period (other than in the case of roll over cash drawings) and at certain other times.

**_Covenants_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains certain of the incurrence covenants and related
definitions (with certain adjustments and exceptions) that are set forth in the Indenture.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires the Issuer and certain of its restricted
subsidiaries to observe certain other customary positive and negative covenants, subject to certain
exceptions and grace periods, including covenants relating to: (i) authorizations; (ii) compliance with
laws; (iii) centre of main interests; (iv) provision of guarantees and security and further assurance; and
(v) compliance with sanctions, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes (x) (prior to the first date on which
the drawn super senior leverage ratio financial covenant is required to be tested only and not, for the
avoidance of doubt, thereafter) a financial covenant requiring the Group to maintain a certain minimum

##### 151


-----

liquidity (the “Minimum Liquidity Covenant”), and (y) (solely from the first test date in respect of the
drawn super senior leverage ratio financial covenant (as determined in accordance with the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) and not, for the avoidance of doubt, prior to such date) a financial
covenant requiring the drawn super senior leverage ratio not to exceed a flat ratio to be set with
headroom versus the Group’s Pro Forma Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA described in this Offering
Memorandum (the “Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio”).

The Minimum Liquidity Covenant is calculated as the amount which is the sum of (x) cash and cashequivalent investments, plus (y) the aggregate unutilised amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility,
any ancillary facilities and any other facilities (howsoever described) which constitute permitted
indebtedness which are undrawn and uncancelled and which are capable of being drawn as cash
advances, plus (z) any other committed sources of liquidity available to the Group at such time. The
Minimum Liquidity Covenant, if breached, will result in an event of default unless the breach is cured
or remedied.

The Minimum Liquidity Covenant is tested on the last day of each calendar month falling prior to the
date on which the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio covenant is required to be tested, commencing
with the first complete calendar month following the Closing Date.

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio is calculated as the ratio of consolidated drawn loans under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, less the amount of cash, cash equivalents and temporary cash
investments of the Group (the “Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt”) to Consolidated _pro forma_
EBITDA for the twelve month period preceding the relevant quarterly testing date.

The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio covenant is tested quarterly on a rolling basis, subject to the
aggregate outstanding principal base currency amount of all Loans outstanding under the New
Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any utilizations drawn on or prior to the Closing Date (and any
rollover loan in respect thereof), any utilizations by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees),
ancillary facilities, or any amounts used to fund any original issue discount and any other flex-related
payments or other fees, costs and expenses (and any rollover loan in respect thereof)) less any cash,
cash equivalents and temporary cash investments held by the Group exceeding 40% of the total
commitments of the New Revolving Credit Facility (or, if higher, the total commitments in respect of
the New Revolving Credit Facility as at the date of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) on
the relevant test date (the “Test Condition”). The Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio covenant, if
breached, will result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement unless
such breach is cured or remedied.

The Minimum Liquidity Covenant and the Drawn Super Senior Leverage Ratio are based on the
definitions and adjustments in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which may differ from
similar definitions in the Indenture and the equivalent definitions described in this offering
memorandum.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the
shareholders of the Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Issuer to
(i) increase the consolidated pro forma EBITDA under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
(ii) decrease Drawn Super Senior Facilities Debt, or (iii) prepay the New Revolving Credit Facility so
that the Test Condition is no longer satisfied. The equity cure rights pursuant to (i) and (ii) above may
not be exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility and
the equity cure rights pursuant to (i) above may not be exercised more than twice in any consecutive
four quarter periods. A breach of the Minimum Liquidity Covenant may be cured by the provision of
additional available liquidity, provided that such additional liquidity is made available within the
timeframe set forth in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

If any financial covenant has been breached but is complied with on the next test date or other relevant
period prior to the next test date (the “Second Test Date”) or (in relation to the Drawn Super Senior

##### 152


-----

Leverage Ratio covenant) the Test Condition is not satisfied on the Second Test Date, then any event
of default arising as a result shall be automatically deemed cured.

**_Events of Default_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as
under the Notes. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement provides for additional
events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i)
inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made; (ii) repudiation, rescission, invalidity and
unlawfulness of the New Revolving Credit Facility financing documents; and (iii) material failure to
comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance
with English law although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and
related definitions scheduled to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will be interpreted in
accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Issuer,
certain Guarantors and the Trustee will enter into the Intercreditor Agreement between, among others,
the agent, arrangers and lenders under our New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Security
Agent. We expect the Trustee to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the Issue Date.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms and
conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Issuer, the
Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third
Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third Party
Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to
which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and
turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes and of
the Trustee. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the

The Notes and the Note Guarantees will be Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement. On the Issue Date, no Senior Lender Liabilities, Second Lien Lender
Liabilities, Second Lien Notes Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be outstanding. Such liabilities and
liabilities in respect of other new debt financings may only be incurred and/or designated if not
prohibited under the terms of the Debt Documents, including, without limitation, the covenants
applicable to the Notes described under “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants.”

_Guarantees and Security: Topco Creditors_

The creditors in respect of the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Creditors”) have the right to take, accept
or receive the benefit of:

(i) any Topco Shared Security from any member of the Senior Secured Group or from a Third
Party Security Provider in respect of the Topco Liabilities if and to the extent legally possible
and subject to any agreed security principles, at the same time it is also offered either:

(A) to the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or applicable

Liabilities; or

(II) to the Security Agent under a parallel debt structure, joint and several creditor
structure or agency structure for the benefit of the other Secured Parties (or
applicable class thereof), and ranks in the same order of priority as described
under “Priority of Security” above, provided that all amounts received or
recovered by any Topco Creditor with respect to such Topco Shared Security
are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below;_

(ii) any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance from any member of the Senior Secured Group in
respect of the Topco Liabilities in addition to any guarantee, indemnity or assurance in the

Party Security Provider to the Secured Parties under the Debt Documents if, subject to any
agreed security principles:

(A) (except for any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance permitted by the Finance
Documents), the Secured Parties other than the Topco Creditors (the “Priority Secured
Parties”) already benefit from such a guarantee, indemnity or other assurance or at the
same time it is also offered to the Priority Secured Parties and ranks in the same order
of priority as described under “—Priority of Debts” and “Priority of Security” above,
as applicable; and

(B) all amounts received by any Topco Creditor with respect to such guarantee, indemnity
or assurance are immediately paid to the Security Agent for application as set out under
“—Application of Proceeds” below; and

(B) from any member of the Senior Secured Group:

(I) in connection with any escrow or similar arrangements relating to amounts held
by a person which is not a member of the Topco Group prior to release of those
amounts to a member of the Topco Group;

(II) in connection with any actual or proposed defeasance, redemption,
prepayment, repayment, purchase or other discharge of any Secured Liabilities
not prohibited by the Intercreditor Agreement; or

(III) as otherwise permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement.

No security (other than pursuant to the secured documents relating to Topco Independent
Transaction Security or Topco Shared Security or as described above) shall be granted by a
member of the Senior Secured Group in respect of any Topco Liabilities.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements that will constitute, for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management
Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior
Liabilities or Hedging Liabilities (each a “New Debt Financing”). The conditions include certification
by the Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional, supplemental financing arrangement
under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt
Financing, each agent in respect of any Priority Secured Liabilities and the Security Agent (and each
other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security
document) is authorized and instructed to enter promptly into any new security document, amend or
waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security
or Topco Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) and/or to effect the ranking, priority
guarantees and security of the New Debt Financing subject to certain conditions, including as regards
the terms of any such new security in relation to such New Debt Financing (which shall be, unless
otherwise agreed by the Issuer or otherwise required by the Issuer to the extent that the existing
Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is not being amended or released and
the new Transaction Security or new Topco Independent Transaction Security only secures the New

##### 158


-----

Debt Financing, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its
subsidiaries who, after the Closing Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is
otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or
which is otherwise acquired after the Closing Date (together an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any
security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing
which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set
out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject
to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist and there is no requirement to offer
that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt
Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by
any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i)
over any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the
Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject
to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other
than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such
Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or
other assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation in relation to such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including
any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors, members of the Group and Third Party Security Providers may make payment in respect
of the Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities and
Cash Management Facility Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured
Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time,
provided that following certain acceleration events under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement
or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any
Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following an Insolvency Event (defined
below), payments may only be made by Issuer, the members of the Group or Third Party Security
Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under
“Application of Proceeds” provided that there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments
received, other than those related to an enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal
(as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following
an acceleration event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of an
event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Second Lien Debt_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities and the Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities (together, the “Senior Secured Liabilities” and together with the Second Lien
Liabilities and Topco Liabilities being the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the “Senior
Secured Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the members of the Group and Third Party Security Providers
may only make specified scheduled payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, in accordance
with the finance documents governing such Second Lien Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain
conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

##### 159


-----

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalized
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement and any Senior
Secured Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to
permit it or is otherwise permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement), no payment stop notice has been
issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Second Lien Liabilities and no Senior Secured Payment
Default (as defined below) has occurred and is continuing.

Certain specified payments in respect of Second Lien Liabilities are also permitted at all times,
notwithstanding that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These
payments and basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Topco Liabilities in (ii)
of the next paragraph.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date (the “Second
Lien Discharge Date”) on which all Second Lien Liabilities have been discharged (the “Priority
Discharge Date”), the Issuer, the members of the Group, Topco Borrowers and Third Party Security
Providers may only make specified scheduled payments to the Topco Creditors or any Topco Borrower
(in respect of the Topco Liabilities) or a Topco Investor (in respect of any Topco Proceeds Loan
Liabilities only) (together the “Topco Group Liabilities”) to the Topco Creditors or any holding
company of the Issuer or other lender in respect of a Topco Proceeds Loan (in respect of the Topco

Lien Notes (a “Second Lien Payment Default”); and

(C) the payment is of (1) any amount of principal or capitalized interest in respect of the
Topco Liabilities which is (x) not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities), or any
required consents to permit such payment have been obtained or (y) required in
connection with a Non-Distressed Disposal

(as defined below) or any other transaction not prohibited by the terms of any Finance
Documents or for claims and other proceeds sought before the occurrence of an acceleration
event has occurred and is continuing or the enforcement of any Transaction Security pursuant
to such acceleration event, (2) any other amount which is not an amount of principal or
capitalized interest (such other amounts including all scheduled interest payments (including,
if applicable, special interest (or liquidated damages) the accrual of cash interest otherwise
payable during a period when a Topco Payment Stop Notice is outstanding and default interest
on the Topco Liabilities accrued and payable in accordance with the terms of the relevant Topco
Finance Document (as at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts
payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Topco Liabilities and amounts in
respect of currency indemnities in any Topco Finance Document, (3) made in pursuance of a
debt buy-back program approved by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, Majority Super
Senior Creditors and Majority Second Lien Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts
due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or
(other than in respect of paragraph (N) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default and/or a
Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and (if the Topco Borrower is a
guarantor or borrower under any prior ranking debt facilities at such time, other than in respect
of paragraph (L) below) irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking debt facilities
have accelerated their debt, the payment is not prohibited to be made at such time by any prior
ranking financing agreements (in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities and the Second Lien
Liabilities), or the payment is (without double counting any equivalent applicable basket in any
Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees
under any original fee letter relating to the Topco Finance Documents, (B) of commercially
reasonable advisory and professional fees, costs or expenses for restructuring advice and
valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or

below)not exceeding €1,500,000 in aggregate, but excluding the costs of any litigation against
a Senior Secured Creditor or Second Lien Creditor (or their affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed
to a Topco Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs necessary to protect, preserve or enforce
security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums, amendment fees (including any
original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and any expenses incurred in
respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Topco Finance Documents (including in relation to
any reporting or listing requirements under the Topco Finance Documents), (F) of any other
amount not exceeding €5,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) in aggregate in any
financial year of the Issuer, provided that any such amount not so applied may be carried
forward and utilized in the subsequent financial year (where it shall be deemed to have been
used first), (G) of any amount of the Topco Liabilities which would have been payable but for
the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and no new Topco Payment
Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalized and added to the principal amount of
the Topco Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result of the accrual of cash
interest payable in respect of the Topco Liabilities during such period or any such amount
described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain events of
default have occurred under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities or would
occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior
Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Group Liabilities documents which is
continuing, all or part of the Topco Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Issuer (a “Debt for Equity
Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Topco
Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control as defined in any prior ranking finance
agreement or Topco Finance Document and that any Liabilities owed by a member of the Senior
Secured Group to another member of the Senior Secured Group, to the Subordinated Creditors
or to any other holding company of the Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity
Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities and Second Lien Liabilities pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Creditors and Second Lien Creditors are
granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated
Liabilities owed by any member of the Senior Secured Group, (I) of non-cash interest made by
way of capitalizing interest or issuing a non-cash pay financial instrument which is
subordinated on the same terms as the Topco Liabilities, (J) of audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes

Secured Group or such payment is funded from proceeds received by the Topco Borrower from
the Senior Secured Group without breaching the terms of the Debt Documents, (M) if the
payment is of a principal amount of the Topco Liabilities and made in accordance with a
provision in a Topco Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or any other

##### 161


-----

provision that permits the repayment in full of the participation of any Topco Creditor (without
a related requirement to repay all other Topco Creditors), including a provision (if any) in a
Topco Finance Document which is substantially equivalent to the prepayment of a single lender
in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (N) if
no Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default has occurred and is
continuing the payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or
after the final maturity date of the relevant Topco Liabilities (provided that such maturity date
is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant Topco Finance Document
as of the date of first issuance or borrowing (as the case may be) of the applicable Topco
Liabilities; or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors, Super Senior Creditors and Second Lien Creditors
give prior consent to that payment being made.

A reference in the section above to a payment shall be construed to include any other direct or indirect
step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Topco Liabilities which are otherwise prohibited under
the Intercreditor Agreement.

On or after the Priority Discharge Date, the Debtors, the Topco Borrowers and the Third Party Security
Providers may make payments in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities in accordance with the Topco
Finance Documents and the Topco Proceeds Loan Agreement (as applicable).

_Topco Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Topco Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date falling one Business Day
after the date on which, following the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Secured
Liabilities (a “Senior Secured Event of Default”) or an event of default under the Second Lien Liabilities
(a “Second Lien Event of Default”), the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super
Senior Creditors, Senior Secured Creditors or Second Lien Creditors gave the instructions for the
relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a “Topco Payment Stop Notice”) to the agent under any Topco
Facility (the “Topco Agent”) and the trustee under any Topco Notes (the “Topco Notes Trustee”)
advising that the Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default is continuing and
suspending payments by the Senior Secured Group of the Topco Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Topco Liabilities;

(iii) if a Topco Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Topco
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant Senior Secured Event of Default or Second Lien Event of Default
has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Second Lien Creditors
gave the instructions for the relevant Topco Payment Stop Notice to be delivered) delivers a
notice to the Topco Borrower, the Topco Agent and the Topco Notes Trustee cancelling the
Topco Payment Stop Notice;

(vi) the Priority Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Topco Creditors take any enforcement action that is permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement (see “—Permitted Topco Enforcement” below).

##### 162


-----

No Topco Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a Senior Secured
Event of Default or a Second Lien Event of Default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the
relevant event

of default. No more than one Topco Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same
event or set of circumstances, or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Topco Group Liabilities as a result of the issue of
a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that
failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Topco Group Liabilities, or (ii) the issue of an
enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents documenting any
Topco Group Liabilities (a “Topco Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Topco Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalization of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor from the
liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue) under the
applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The
accrual and capitalization of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall
continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Topco Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default or Second Lien Payment Default, that Topco Payment Stop Notice
ceases to be outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default or
Second Lien Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor or Topco Borrower then promptly pays to the Topco Creditors or any party
that has acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a creditor under a Topco Proceeds Loan (the
“Topco Investors”) (in respect of the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities only) an amount equal
to any payments which had accrued under the Topco Finance Documents or the Topco Proceeds
Loan Agreement (as applicable) and which would have been Permitted Topco Payments but
for that Topco Payment Stop Notice or Senior Secured Payment Default or Second Lien
Payment Default (as the case may be),

(iii) then any event of default which may have occurred under a Topco Finance Document or Topco
Proceeds Loan Agreement and any Topco Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as
a result of that suspension of payments shall be waived without any further action being
required.

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, at any time prior to the
latest to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date (as defined below), the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Second Lien Discharge Date and the first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been
fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any creditor (other than a
Senior Secured Creditor) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group
or Third Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to
the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either

##### 163


-----

(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) other than where specific set-off provisions apply, any amount by way of set-off which does
not give effect to a payment permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the
Debt Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of
any Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of
any other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Senior Secured
Group or any Third Party Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of
an acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such
an acceleration event, other than, in each case, any amount received or recovered in
accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”,

and, in the case of any Intra-Group Liabilities, any amounts received or recovered in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement (to the extent permitted to be received or recovered
notwithstanding the occurrence and continuation of an Acceleration Event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) other than where specific set-off or New Debt Financing provisions apply, any distribution in
cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed by
any Debtor, any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds” and
which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
Debtor, member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider,

That creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received
or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent
and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount
equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to
the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement;
and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time prior to the
Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any Debtor, any member
of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement
of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the
enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts
which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “—Application of Proceeds.”

##### 164


-----

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to any Obligor, Material Subsidiary (being each original
obligor under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, subject to certain adjustments and the
agreed security principles that apply to the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, each member of
the Group that has an EBITDA representing more than 5% of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Group)
or Third Party Security Provider, (a) the passing of any resolution or making of an order for insolvency,
bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganization, (b) a moratorium
is declared in relation to any of its indebtedness, (c) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or
any of its assets, or (d) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each
case), (i) frivolous or vexatious proceedings and which, if capable of remedy, are discharged, stayed or
dismissed within 20 Business Days of commencement or, if earlier, the date on which it is advertised
(or such other period as agreed), (ii) proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied
will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or (iii) as permitted under any Senior Secured Credit Facility
Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of an Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third Party
Security Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute
proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution
to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The
Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out
under “—Application of Proceeds” below.

To the extent that any member of the Senior Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider’s liabilities
to creditors are, with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in
the case of a Senior Secured Creditor, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off
shall pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that setoff to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—Application
_of Proceeds” below._

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the
extent that the realization proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each creditor irrevocably authorizes the Security Agent to take
Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and receive distributions, file claims
and take other actions necessary to make recovery in relation to the Debtors, member of the Senior
Secured Group or Third Party Security Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent
reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement_**

_Regime Enforcement of Security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent may not take any action to enforce the
Transaction Security or the Topco Independent Transaction Security without the prior written consent
of an Instructing Group, Majority Second Lien Creditors or Majority Topco Creditors (as applicable)
otherwise as specified in the provisions described below.

##### 165


-----

An “Instructing Group” means:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge Date”),
Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing more than 50%
of the credit participations of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior
Liabilities) (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing
more than 50% of the credit participations of the Super Senior Secured Liabilities (the
“Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall
mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
enforcement regime described under “—Enforcement of Transaction Security” below;

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date
but before the Priority Discharge Date, Second Lien Creditors representing more than 50% of
the credit participations of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”);
and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, Topco Creditors
representing more than 50% of the credit participations of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority
Topco Creditors”).

_Enforcement of Transaction Security_

The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless instructed otherwise in
accordance with the provisions described in this paragraph. If the Transaction Security has become
enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish
to issue enforcement instructions their respective representatives (and, if applicable, the hedge
counterparties) shall deliver a copy of those instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the
Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge counterparties which did not deliver such
Initial Enforcement Notice and those enforcement instructions shall be consistent with the Enforcement
Principles.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of
enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial
Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior Discharge has not occurred within six months of the Initial

sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third
Party Security Provider or Debtor):

company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or
holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) (if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a
Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those
liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document,
the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

intend that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Creditor or a Secured Party for
the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement), to execute and deliver or enter into any
agreement to dispose of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured
Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third Party Security Providers and Debtors; and

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all
or any part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that
Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

##### 172


-----

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or
liabilities to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to
which those obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those
obligations; and

(B) (provided the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities or the
Topco Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of the obligations in respect of
those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on behalf of the Receiving
Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of those intra-group
liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above in (iv)) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of
an enforcement of the Transaction Security and, to the extent that any disposal of liabilities has occurred
pursuant to (iv) above, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities pursuant to (iv) and (v) above) effected
by, or at the request of, the Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair
market price in the prevailing market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any
obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher
price), and shall in all cases comply with the requirements set out in the paragraphs below (as
applicable) and act in accordance with them (as applicable).

to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent
is not authorized to release any Debtor, Subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities
or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid
(or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable
to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to

guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor
unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured
Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent
liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject
of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) immediately following that
release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities would otherwise be released
pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to have those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the Issuer
specified by such creditor, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized (at the cost of the
relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing
liabilities, guarantee liabilities or other liabilities.

proceeds received or recovered in connection with such sale or disposal are fair from a
financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement (it being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no
obligation to select or engage any investment bank, firm of accountants or third party
financial adviser unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded
to its satisfaction).

be deemed to be the case if there are no bidders or if each Senior Agent and
Senior Secured Notes Trustee (acting reasonably and in good faith) determines
that there are no bona fide and fully committed bids in cash or substantially all
in cash in excess of the outstanding amount of the Senior Secured Liabilities);

Liabilities and Topco Liabilities are entitled to participate as prospective
buyers and/or financiers; or

(II) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognized investment
bank, firm of accountants or third party professional firm which has delivered
an opinion (including an enterprise valuation) in respect of such sale or
disposal that the amount is fair from a financial point of view, taking into
account all relevant circumstances including the method of enforcement (it
being acknowledged that the Security Agent shall have no obligation to select
or engage any investment bank, firm of accountants or third party professional
firm unless it shall have been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to
its satisfaction).

_Order of Application—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement, all amounts from time to time
received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Topco Document in connection
with the realization or enforcement of Topco Independent Transaction Security or any guarantees

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalization_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after
the first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments
amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position
that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended
or waived only with the consent of the Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent that an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class
of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or
adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the agent
or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under “—Application of Proceeds” or “—Turnover”
above and the order of priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made
without the consent of each of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance
documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and

##### 178


-----

the Topco Liabilities, (i) each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash
Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), (iii) each Hedge Counterparty
(only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of creditors), and (iv)
the Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorized by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such
instructions or authorizations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented
or authorized to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or
trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below) or as permitted
by the Debt Documents, (i) the Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend the terms of, release
or waive any of the requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party, (ii) the
Security Agent may, if the Issuer consents, amend, release and/or retake any Transaction Security
Document where such amendment, release and/or retake is required in order to ensure the validity,
perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created under such Transaction
Security Document, together with any related or consequential waiver (including by reason of a failure
to register such Transaction Security Document with Companies House within the prescribed time limit
set out in section 859 of the Companies Act 2006, in which case the Security Agent shall also
irrevocably waive any payment or other obligation or default arising out of such failure to register) and
any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be binding on each party, and (iii) to authorize
any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document creating Transaction Security
which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction Security or the
manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed, prior written consent is required from (w) each of the agents or
trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the
Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, (x) each Cash
Management Facility Lender (only to the extent that the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under
the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any
other creditor or class of creditors), (y) each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent that the proposed
amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge
Counterparty under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights
and obligations of any other creditor or class), and (z) the Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the
Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case
may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “—Amendments and Waivers:
_Transaction Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement,_
relating in particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) to any
amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the

##### 179


-----

provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or
the provisions set out under “—New Debt Financings,” “Non-Distressed Disposals” and “—Distressed
_Disposals” above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant_
provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Issuer and the
Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any
action or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement
or another applicable agreement (but excluding any indenture), any creditor fails to respond to the
request within ten Business Days (or any other period of time notified by the Issuer, with the agreement
of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) or fails to provide details of its
credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded or be deemed to have zero participation in respect
of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable.
However, this provision shall not apply to any noteholder in respect of a request where such noteholder
is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative but shall otherwise apply to all
noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following an initial public offering of a member of the Senior Secured Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Issuer is entitled to give notice that the terms of the Debt Documents will
automatically operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Senior Secured Group (and all related
provisions) will now refer to the member of the Senior Secured Group or holding company of the Issuer
who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity”,
and if any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown
Entity shall be the Topco Borrower) and its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations
shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity, (iii) certain provisions of
the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease to apply
to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the
Debt Documents (including any Transaction Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third Party
Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) or Topco
Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor
Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50%
of any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility
and noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant
IPO), the Issuer and each subsidiary of the Issuer shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor
and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document
required to facilitate such matters; provided that such amendment, release or replacement or other
document or instrument does not impose personal obligations on the Security Agent or any applicable
agent or trustee or affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnities or immunities of the Security Agent
or any applicable agent or trustee under the applicable Debt Documents.

_Agreement to Override_

Subject to the exercise by the Security Agent or any Agent of any of its respective rights or benefits
contained in the Intercreditor Agreement or in any Debt Document, to the extent any step or action is

##### 180


-----

permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (or permitted subject to the consent of specified parties
under the Intercreditor Agreement), the parties agree that such step or action will be permitted under
the other Debt Documents (or permitted thereunder subject to the consent of such specified parties or
satisfaction of certain conditions contained therein) and if there is any conflict between the terms of, or
the requirement for any conditions in, the Intercreditor Agreement and any other Debt Document, the
terms of, or the requirement for any conditions in, the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail (save to the
extent that to do so would result in or have the effect of any member of the Group contravening any
applicable law or regulation, or present a material risk of liability for any member of the Group and/or
its directors or officers, or give rise to a material risk of breach of fiduciary or statutory duties), in each
case notwithstanding any restriction or prohibition to the contrary, any provision expressed or purported
to override any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or the requirement to fulfil any additional
conditions, in each case, in any other Debt Document.

**Rolled Company Indebtedness and Other Obligations**

**_Bank Loans_**

We are a party to several bilateral overdraft, loan, working capital and credit line agreements in Italy,
Belgium, Norway, Poland and Switzerland, which we utilise to finance our ordinary course of business
activities as well as our liquidity and working capital needs. In addition, during the year ended
December 31, 2020, we incurred several state-aid loans in Switzerland and Poland to help us mitigate
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The obligations under these financing
agreements are in certain instances guaranteed by certain entities in the Group and/or secured, including
by pledges over receivables. As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, €11.2 million
was outstanding under these financing arrangements (excluding intercompany loans).

**_Finance Leases and Sale- and Lease-Back_**

We are a party to certain pre-IFRS 16 finance leases in several of our countries of operations. We mainly
incur finance leases in connection with real estate, vehicles and parking equipment. The outstanding
amount under these leases is secured on the underlying asset as well as by third-party guarantees. As of
March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, €37.3 million was outstanding under these
finance leases. In addition, in 2019, we entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement with IntReal
International Real Estate Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH relating to a parking facility in
Heidenheim for €4.8 million.

**_Guarantees_**

In the ordinary course of business, from time to time, the owners and landlords of our parking facilities
request letters of guarantees of our rent payments due to them from the Issuer and/or commercial banks.
We do not consider these guarantees to be indebtedness. As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate
outstanding amount of such bank guarantees was €24.8 million.

**_Other Arrangements_**

Park & Control PAC GmbH has financial liabilities relating to an installment purchase for sensors of
approximately €4.5 million. Under this arrangement, 21,000 sensors are installed to monitor parking
durations on retails sites and assist in issuing control fees if users are running over the maximum allowed
parking duration.

**Loans to and Investments in Joint Ventures**

As of March 31, 2021, APCOA PARKING Belgium NV has made loans totaling €9.5 million to our
ParcBrux joint venture. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of (x) Real Estate Schaffhausen,
our APCOA Parking Switzerland joint venture made an initial investment by way of a shareholder loan
of €2.2 million (equivalent), of which we funded €1.5 million with the remainder being provided by the

##### 181


-----

other two joint venture partners, and (y) our stake in the AGILE Parking Solutions joint venture, we
made an initial investment of €1.7 million (equivalent). As of March 31, 2021, €1.2 million (equivalent)
remained outstanding under our loan to APCOA Parking Switzerland.

##### DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” under the
heading “Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the
“Issuer” are to APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH only and references to the “Third Party Security
_Provider” are to Park LuxCo 3 SCA only and, in each case, not to any of their respective Subsidiaries._
References to “we” or “us” are to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

The Issuer will issue €         million aggregate principal amount of       % Senior Secured Notes
due 2027 (the “Fixed Rate Notes”) and €         million aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2027 (the “Floating Rate _Notes” and, together with the Fixed Rate_
Notes, the “Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by
Guarantors (as defined herein).

The Notes will be issued under an indenture to be dated as of       , 2021 (the “Indenture”), between
the Issuer, the Third Party Security Provider, the Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as
trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, calculation agent and as
transfer agent, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar, and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch,
as security agent (the “Security Agent”), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. The Indenture will not be qualified under, incorporate, include,
by reference or otherwise, or be subject to any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
as amended, including Section 316(b) of such Act.

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture and the Notes and
refers to the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate those agreements
in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of the
Notes. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.” Copies of the Indenture, the form of the
Notes, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under the caption “Listing and General Information.”

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate
portions of the proceeds of the Notes being used to (i) refinance the proceeds under the Existing Term
Loans utilized for refinancing the debt for the (direct or indirect) acquisition of the Italian Guarantors
and related fees, costs and expenses, and (ii) to fund cash to balance sheet for general corporate and
working capital purposes, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers (CUSIPs, ISINs
or common codes) for each such tranche. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests” and “Italy—_
_Limitations to the Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to
understanding the relative ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect
of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking enforcement action, subordination of certain
indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for
amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement
and the pursuit of other remedies. The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

As of the Issue Date, each of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes
of the Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under “—Certain Definitions—

##### 183


-----

_Unrestricted Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries.” Any future Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants
in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

**The Notes**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that
is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, including obligations of the
Issuer under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (if any);

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property and assets that do not secure the Notes, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

- be guaranteed by the Guarantors as described under “—The Note Guarantees”;

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future obligations of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer
that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors;

- mature on        , 2027; and

- be represented by one or more registered notes in global registered form, but in certain
circumstances may be represented by Definitive Registered Notes (see “Book-Entry; Delivery
_and Form”)._

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral or from certain distressed disposals of the Collateral on a pari passu
basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that on an enforcement of the Collateral or certain distressed disposals of the
Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such event after (i) the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) certain hedging obligations, (iii) certain cash management obligations and (iv) other
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a super priority basis under the Indenture have been paid in
full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Issuer is a holding company and all of its operations are conducted through the Subsidiaries. After
giving effect to the Transactions, the only significant asset of the Issuer will be proceeds loans in respect
of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes. Therefore, the Issuer will depend on the cash flow of certain
of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. Under applicable local
regulations, cash and cash equivalents held by Subsidiaries of the Issuer can only be upstreamed to their
direct or indirect parent entities, including to the Issuer for purposes of servicing the Notes, to the extent
that sufficient cumulative distributable profits and cumulative reserves exist within these legal entities
and that they continue to meet relevant minimum capital requirements. As of March 31, 2021, after
giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on that date, the Issuer and its
consolidated Subsidiaries would have had €718.0 million of financial indebtedness (on a pre-IFRS 16
basis). In addition, we have €80 million commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
of which (i) €30.5 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to which bank
guarantees may be issued, (ii) €17 million will be made available as ancillary facilities pursuant to
which cash loans may be drawn, and (iii) €32.5 million will be available for utilisation in accordance
with the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility. The New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to be

##### 184


-----

undrawn on the Issue Date, except for €20.1 million of non-cash guarantees currently issued under the
Existing Revolving Credit Facility and Existing Guarantee Facility which will remain outstanding
pursuant to the ancillary facilities described in the preceding sentence.

**The Note Guarantees**

**_General_**

As of the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes will be guaranteed by APCOA
PARKING Deutschland GmbH, Park & Control PAC GmbH, APCOA Scandinavia AS, APCOA
Parking Norway AS, APCOA Parking Holding Danmark ApS, APCOA Parking Danmark A/S,
APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A., Park & Control S.r.l., APCOA PARKING Belgium NV, APCOA
Parking Austria GmbH, Park & Control PAC Austria GmbH, APCOA Parking Sverige AB, APCOA
Parking Holdings (UK) Limited, APCOA Parking (UK) Limited and APCOA Parking Nederland B.V.
(the “Initial Guarantors”). In addition, if required by the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the_
Agreed Security Principles, certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may provide a Note Guarantee in the
future (the “Additional Guarantors” and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the “Guarantors”). The
Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Guarantors.

The Note Guarantee of each Guarantor will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (including
Indebtedness Incurred under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations);

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that
is expressly subordinated in right of payment to such Note Guarantee (if any);

- be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of such
Guarantor that is secured by property and assets that do not secure such Note Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness; and

- be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of such
Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including obligations to trade creditors.

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral or from certain distressed disposals of the Collateral on a pari passu
basis with all indebtedness that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that on an enforcement of the Collateral or certain distressed disposals of the
Collateral, the Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from such event after (i) the Revolving Credit
Facility, (ii) certain Hedging Obligations, (iii) certain cash management obligations and (iv) other
Indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture have been paid in full. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The obligations of a Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the
relevant Note Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value
or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules,
“thin capitalization” rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations
of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations
under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by
reference to the net assets and legal capital of the relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Note Guarantees
will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. The Note Guarantees will be
further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles which apply to and restrict the granting

##### 185


-----

of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes
where, among other things, any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements and may be precluded if the cost of such grant is disproportionate to the
benefit to the creditors, including the Holders, of obtaining the applicable guarantee. By virtue of these
limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Note Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts
payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Note
Guarantee.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Structure and the Financing,” “Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations,”_ “Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security
_Interests” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

As of December 31, 2019, the Issuer’s subsidiaries that are Guarantors held 56% of our total
unconsolidated assets (on a Pre-IFRS 16 basis). In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Issuer’s
subsidiaries that are Guarantors generated 83% of our total unconsolidated net sales revenues and 81%
of our total unconsolidated Pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA, in each case, before intercompany
eliminations. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors
and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of nonGuarantor Restricted Subsidiaries (if any) generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Note Guarantee therefore will be structurally
subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor
Restricted Subsidiaries (if any). Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries (including non-Guarantor Restricted
Subsidiaries), the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture
will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not
considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under the Indenture. See “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” As of March 31, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions,_
the non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries had €1.5 million of financial indebtedness.

**_Note Guarantees Release_**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital
Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company), if the
sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture and the Guarantor ceases to be a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale or other disposition;

- upon the sale or disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of all or substantially
all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if
the sale or other disposition does not violate the Indenture;

- upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations in respect of the Notes issued
under the Indenture or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge
of the Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

- upon the release of the Guarantor’s guarantee under any Indebtedness that triggered such
Guarantor’s obligation to guarantee the Notes under the covenant described in “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”;_

##### 186


-----

- in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

- as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

- in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization; or

- as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation.”

The Trustee and Security Agent, as applicable, shall take all necessary actions reasonably requested in
writing by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance
with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set
forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and Security Agent, as applicable, without the consent of
or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee and Security Agent,
as applicable.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €         million in aggregate principal amount of Notes. The
Notes will mature on     , 2027. The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If the due date for any payment in respect of any
Notes is not a Business Day or a business day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business
Day or business day at such place, as the case may be, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of     % per annum and will:

- accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

- be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on      and     , commencing on     , 2022;

- be payable to the Holders of record of such Notes on the Business Day immediately preceding
the related interest payment date; and

- be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months on the
aggregate principal amount outstanding.

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal
outstanding on the Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to EURIBOR (which is subject
to a 0% floor) plus         %, as determined by an agent (the “Calculation Agent”) appointed by the
Issuer to calculate EURIBOR for the purposes of the Indenture, which shall initially be Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch.

Interest on the Floating Rate Notes will be payable quarterly in arrears
on        ,        ,         and         of each year, commencing on        , 2021. The
Issuer will make each interest payment to the Holders of record on the immediately preceding Business
Day. The Issuer will pay interest to the Holders of record on the Business Day immediately preceding
the applicable interest payment date. The Floating Rate Notes will bear interest from the Issue Date or,
if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid.

##### 187


-----

The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate, and calculate the aggregate amount of interest
payable on the Floating Rate Notes in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”).
The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the
Floating Rate Notes outstanding at the commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such
amount by the actual number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 365; provided that
interest shall only be paid in respect of Floating Rate Notes outstanding on the applicable interest
payment dates.

All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest
one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point being
rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or 0.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or 0.0487655)). All
euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with
one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest
Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be
binding on all parties. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any
liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be made, by
the Calculation Agent.

The Calculation Agent will, upon the written request of the Holder of any Floating Rate Notes, provide
the interest rate then in effect with respect to the Floating Rate Notes. The rights of holders of beneficial
interests in the Floating Rate Notes to receive payments on such Floating Rate Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. The
Applicable Rate on the Floating Rate Notes will in no event be higher than the maximum rate permitted
by applicable law.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the defined terms used in the Indenture relating to the
calculation of interest on the Floating Rate Notes:

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination
Date will be        , 2021.

“EURIBOR” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum)
for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR1 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels
time, on the Determination Date; provided, however, that EURIBOR shall never be less than 0.00%. If
Reuters Page EURIBOR1 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the
Issuer will request the principal London office (or, at the Issuer’s option, the principal Frankfurt office,
Paris office, Amsterdam office or Brussels office) of each of four major banks in the eurozone interbank market, as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a
percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, to
prime banks in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euros for a
three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination
Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer will
request each of three major banks in London (or, at the option of the Issuer, Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam
or Brussels), as selected by the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m., Brussels time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the
day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so
provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two
such rates are so provided then the rate for the Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to

##### 188


-----

the immediately preceding Interest Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt
if for any Interest Period the rate determined based on the procedure specified in this paragraph is less
than 0%, EURIBOR shall mean 0% for purposes of determining the Applicable Rate for such Interest
Period.

“eurozone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending
on but excluding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that the first Interest
Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and exclude        , 2021.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (a) €1.0 million and (b) an amount that is representative
for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“Reuters Page EURIBOR1” means the display page so designated by Reuters (or such other page as
may replace that page on that service, or if no such page is available, such other page as may replace
that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor).

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro.

If the Issuer determines that the EURIBOR rate is no longer being calculated or administered, or it
becomes illegal for the Calculation Agent to determine any amounts due to be paid, as at the relevant
Determination Date, any alternative rate which has replaced EURIBOR in customary market usage for
the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as
identified by the Issuer, in consultation with an Independent Financial Advisor appointed by the Issuer,
and promptly thereafter notified by the Issuer to the Holders and the Calculation Agent, shall be the
new rate replacing EURIBOR; provided, however, that if the Independent Financial Advisor determines
that there is no clear market consensus as to whether any rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary
market usage, the Independent Financial Advisor shall determine an appropriate alternative rate, and
the decision of the Independent Financial Advisor will be binding on the Issuer, the Calculation Agent
and the Holders; provided further that any such alternative rate adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall
in all cases never be less than 0.00%. Following the adoption of an alternative rate pursuant to this
paragraph, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such alternative
rate.

**Additional Notes**

The Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s
compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”
and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Fixed Rate
Notes (the “Additional Fixed Rate Notes”) and additional Floating Rate Notes (the “Additional Floating
_Rate Notes” and, together with the Additional Fixed Rate Notes, the “Additional Notes”) under the_
Indenture, which shall have terms substantially identical to the existing Fixed Rate Notes or Floating
Rate Notes, as applicable, except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an
Officer’s Certificate supplied to the Trustee:

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(4) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear
interest and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such

##### 189


-----

interest rate or rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment
dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be
determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest is
payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the
currency in which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional
Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms
and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof,
the denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed;

(8) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes; and

(9) any relevant limitation language with respect to Note Guarantees and Security Documents.

Except as otherwise provided for in the Indenture, the Notes (together with any Additional Notes) shall
be treated as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture, including with respect to waivers,
amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for any applicable series.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the
_Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Notes and any Additional_
Notes that are actually issued under the Indenture.

Additional Notes may be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Issue
Date (the “Initial Notes”), but only if they have terms substantially identical in all material respects to
the Initial Notes; provided that, if the Additional Notes are not fungible with the Initial Notes for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, such Additional Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code or common
code or other identifying number, as applicable, from the Initial Notes.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

The rights of Holders to receive payments of interest on the Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business
Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to
payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled
to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay. If a regular record date is not a
Business Day, the record date shall not be affected.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below)
will be made by one or more Paying Agents by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered Holder thereof (being the common depositary or its nominee for
Euroclear and Clearstream).

Principal, interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities
(“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying
Agents maintained for such purposes in the City of London. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Notes may be paid, at the option of the Issuer, by wire transfer to the account of the Holder
entitled thereto as shown on the register of Holders of Notes for the Definitive Registered Notes. See
“—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes” below.

##### 190


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Notes (including the initial Paying Agent).
The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the “Transfer Agent”).

The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the initial Transfer Agent will be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of the
Notes outstanding from time to time and, together with the Transfer Agent, will facilitate transfers of
the Notes on behalf of the Issuer. A register of the Notes shall also be maintained at the registered office
of the Issuer. In case of inconsistency between the register of the Notes kept by the Registrar and the
one kept by the Issuer at its registered office, the register kept by the Issuer shall prevail.

Upon written notice to the Trustee, the Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer
Agent for the Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Notes. The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Notes.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

- each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers
pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Fixed Rate
_Notes”) and each series of Floating Rate Notes sold within the United States to qualified_
institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented
by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “144A
_Global Floating Rate Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Fixed Rate Notes, the “144A_
_Global Notes”). The 144A Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and_
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream; and

- each series of Fixed Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Fixed Rate Global Notes”) and each series
of Floating Rate Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Floating Rate Global Notes” and, together
with the Regulation S Fixed Rate Notes, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with
the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue
Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on transfer
and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under “Book-Entry;
_Delivery and Form” and “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between_
participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream
pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

##### 191


-----

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes
(the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Book-Entry Interests of the same series only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
person who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” “Transfer Restrictions” and in
accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

No Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Global Fixed Rate
_Notes”), and no Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Global_
Fixed Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed Rate Notes”), may be transferred or exchanged for
any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Global Floating
_Rate Notes”) or any Definitive Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the_
Global Floating Rate Notes (the “Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and no Book-Entry
Interest in the Global Floating Rate Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be
transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Global Fixed Rate Note or any Definitive
Registered Fixed Rate Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from
and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the relevant Book-Entry
Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set
forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be
subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized below and
described more fully under “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form” and “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes
may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of €100,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer
or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging Holder to, among other things,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account
of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with
such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the applicable Notes;

##### 192


-----

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of the applicable Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be entitled to treat
the registered Holder of a Note as the owner thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Notes and Note Guarantees
will be secured by first-priority security interests ranking pari passu with the security interests securing
the Revolving Credit Facility, certain cash management obligations and certain Hedging Obligations
(subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement) as follows:

- a first-ranking pledge over the shares of the Issuer held by the Parent;

- a first-ranking pledge over the structural intercompany receivables owed to the Parent by the
Issuer (if any);

- a first-ranking pledge over material bank accounts of the Issuer;

- a first-ranking share pledge over the shares of each Guarantor;

- a first-ranking pledge over material bank accounts of each Guarantor (except for Guarantors
organized under the laws of Denmark, Sweden and Italy), and subject to certain exceptions and
carve-outs;

- a first-ranking pledge or security assignment agreement, as applicable, over structural
intercompany receivables owed by the Issuer and each Guarantor to the Issuer or other
Guarantors (if any); and

- subject to customary carve-outs, floating charge over all of the assets of the Guarantors
organized under the laws of England and Wales (to the extent not interfering with the day-today operation of their business (as determined by the relevant Guarantor)).

As described above, the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Revolving Credit Facility,
certain Hedging Obligations and any Additional Notes and may also secure certain future Indebtedness.
However, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals of the Collateral only after the Revolving
Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, certain cash management obligations and certain other
indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture, if any, have been repaid
in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” The proceeds
from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the
Holders of the Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this issuance
of Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of
time, or at all.

Under the Indenture, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to Incur certain
additional Indebtedness in the future that may share in the Collateral, including additional Permitted

##### 193


-----

Collateral Liens securing Indebtedness (including Additional Notes) on a _pari passu basis with the_
Notes, including Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain cash
management arrangements and certain priority Hedging Obligations. The amount of such Permitted
Collateral Liens will be limited by the covenants described under the captions “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Under certain_
circumstances, the amount of such additional Indebtedness secured by Permitted Collateral Liens could
be significant.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” certain property, rights and assets may not be pledged, and any pledge over_
property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the Agreed
Security Principles. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security
Principles, which include, among others:

- general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalization,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled
foreign corporation,” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital
maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims,
employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of
a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or
security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the guarantee or security will be limited
accordingly, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any
applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use
reasonable endeavors (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or
security document shall be subject to such limit;

- key factors in the determination of whether or not a guarantee or security will be taken (and in
respect of security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) will be: (i) the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes (including, in the Issuer’s sole determination,
in respect of the Group, its investors and/or its shareholders), interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to any person that is not a member of
the Group and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit
accruing to the Secured Parties (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) of obtaining such
guarantee or security; and (ii) in respect of any guarantee or security which, in the determination
of the Issuer (acting reasonably), may be required to be discharged and/or released in
connection with any corporate, tax structuring or other reorganization of the Group (an
“Anticipated Reorganization”), the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes,
interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs, guarantee fees payable to
any person that is not a member of the Group and all applicable legal fees) of taking, and then
subsequently discharging and/or releasing such guarantee or security in connection with any
Anticipated Reorganization, will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured
Parties of obtaining such guarantee or security;

- the agreement that members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter into
security documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the
fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or
contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal
or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided
that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security
document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall, in relation to a
contractual prohibition or restriction only, use reasonable endeavors (but without incurring

##### 194


-----

material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any
such obstacle or otherwise such guarantee or security document shall be subject to such limit;

- the limitation of guarantees and security so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an
amount to be agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent

- where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security,
security will be granted over the material assets only;

- the express acknowledgement that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security
over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

- the exclusion from any guarantee or security of any asset subject to a legal requirement,
contract, lease, license, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any
government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or
condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable security
document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council
(or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable security document, would give
a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor
to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in
each case will be excluded from a guarantee or security document, provided that reasonable
endeavors (exercised for a specified period of time) to obtain consent to charging any asset

For further information regarding limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses
generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations
under applicable law, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on Validity and
_Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests” and each, a “Security Interest”) as between (a) the lenders under
the Revolving Credit Facility, (b) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (c) the Trustee,
the Security Agent, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and the Holders of the Notes
under the Indenture, and (d) the creditors of certain other present and future Indebtedness permitted to
be secured by the Collateral, respectively, will be established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, which provide, among other things, that the obligations under
the Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the Notes are secured equally and
ratably by first priority Security Interests; however, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Holders of the Notes will only receive proceeds from a distressed disposal of, or the enforcement of the
Collateral after certain priority obligations including (i) obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility,
(ii) certain priority Hedging Obligations, (iii) certain cash management obligations and (iv) certain other
Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred on a priority basis under the Indenture have been paid in full. In
addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into
after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Description of

##### 197


-----

_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain_
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_Security Documents_**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors have granted, or will grant, security over
the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ payment obligations
under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into
by the relevant security provider, the Security Agent on behalf of the secured parties. When entering
into the Security Documents, the Security Agent has acted in its own name, but also for the benefit of
the secured parties (including itself, the Trustee and the Holders of Notes from time to time). Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act as an agent of the lenders under the Revolving
Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations.

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable
laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the
Trustee and the Holders of the Notes. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, Holders of the
Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes,
except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture)
provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the enforcement of the Collateral. See
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, as applicable, will be secured by the
Collateral until all obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Indenture have been
discharged. However, the Security Interests over the Collateral with respect to the Notes and the
Indenture may be released under certain circumstances as provided under “—Release of Liens.” The
Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents with respect to the Notes
and the Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. The Holders may only act through the
Trustee, who will instruct the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of
the Security Interests or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders may not
be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Issuer and the Guarantors will have the right to remain in
possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes, to freely operate the
property and assets constituting Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom
(including any and all dividends, distributions or similar cash and non-cash payments in respect of
Capital Stock of the Guarantors that is part of the Collateral).

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to
enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security
Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the creditors under the Revolving Credit
Facility or certain hedge counterparties. The ability to enforce may also be restricted by similar
arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement and_ “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

##### 198


-----

The creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to hedging obligations secured by
the Collateral and the Trustee have and, by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
appointed the Security Agent to act as their respective agent under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The creditors under
the Revolving Credit Facility, the Holders of Notes, the counterparties to Hedging Obligations secured
by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
(A) authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents
securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with any other incidental
rights, power and discretions; (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment,
renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf; and (B) relieved
the Security Agent from the restrictions pursuant to section 181 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches
_Gesetzbuch) and similar restrictions applicable to it pursuant to any other law, in each case to the extent_
legally possible.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the enforcement or sale of the Collateral would be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and Note
Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional
Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. No
appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature,
some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness, the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Collateral—The_
_Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Notes” and “It may be difficult to_
_realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes.”_

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Indenture will provide that it will be subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and
that the Issuer and the Trustee will be authorized (without any further consent of the Holders of the
Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement and to give effect to its provisions.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed
to have irrevocably:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the Security
Documents and perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are
specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents securing
such Indebtedness, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions;

(2) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements and the Security Documents; and

(3) appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act on its behalf to enter into and comply with
the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements and the
Security Documents (including the execution of, and compliance with, any waiver,
modification, amendment, renewal by the Trustee or the Security Agent on its behalf).

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(as defined below) entered into in compliance with the provisions described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”_

##### 199


-----

**_Release of Liens_**

The Issuer and the Guarantors will be entitled to release the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral
under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) other than the Liens over the Capital Stock of the Issuer held by the Third Party Security
Provider, in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to (a) a Person that is
not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the_
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
_Stock” and is not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary;_
_provided that this clause (1)(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock_
or intercompany loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Receivables
Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become
subject to, a Lien in favor of the Notes following such sale or disposal (subject to the Agreed
Security Principles);

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Liens”;_

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or legal
defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets
of, and Capital Stock issued by, such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in connection with the granting of Liens on such property or assets, which may include
Collateral, or the sale or transfer of such property or assets, which may include Collateral, in
each case pursuant to a Qualified Receivables Financing; and

(8) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement (including upon delivery of a Pushdown Notice as described under
“—IPO Debt Pushdown”) or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (b) as may be permitted by
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

The Security Agent and the Trustee (but only if required) will take all necessary action reasonably
requested in writing by the Issuer to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security
Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is
required by it to effect such release).

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide that on or following certain Equity Offerings (or in
contemplation of certain Equity Offerings with respect to the release of security if required to implement

##### 200

such Equity Offering), the Issuer shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the trustee under the
Indenture (a “Pushdown Notice”)) that the terms of the Indenture and the other Debt Documents (as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) shall operate (with effect from the date specified in the relevant
Pushdown Notice) as described under “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement—Required consents—Provisions following an IPO.”_

**Optional Redemption**

**_Fixed Rate Notes_**

Except as described below and except as described under “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” the
Fixed Rate Notes are not redeemable until     , 2023. On and after   , 2023, the Issuer may redeem

outstanding after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to        , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem during each
calendar year up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate Notes outstanding
(including the original principal amount of any Additional Fixed Rate Notes), upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price of 103% of the principal amount of the Fixed Rate
Notes so redeemed, _plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not_

**_Floating Rate Notes_**

At any time prior to        , 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem the Floating
Rate Notes in whole or in part, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus the Applicable Premium as of, and
accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Floating Rate Notes redeemed to,

At any time and from time to time on or after        , 2022, the Issuer may on any one or more

**_Optional Redemption upon Certain Tender Offers_**

In connection with any tender offer for, or other offer to purchase, any Notes, including a Change of
Control Offer (as defined below) or Asset Disposition Offer (as defined below), if holders of not less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes validly tender and do not
validly withdraw such Notes in such tender offer and the Issuer, or any third party making such tender
offer in lieu of the Issuer, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn by such
holders, the Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem all Notes,
that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to each other Holder
of the Notes, in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, the date of such
redemption.

**_General_**

We may repurchase the Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise. Notice
of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice.”

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes, it will, for so long as Notes are listed on any
securities exchange and the rules of such an exchange so require, inform the exchange of such optional
redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding
immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest up to, but excluding, the redemption date will be paid to
the Person in whose name the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and no additional interest will
be payable to Holders whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

In connection with any redemption of Notes (including with the proceeds from an Equity Offering), any
such redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

If the Issuer elects to redeem the Notes or portions thereof and, in connection with a satisfaction and
discharge or defeasance of the Indenture in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—
_Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge,” requests that the Trustee distribute to the Holders_

##### 202


-----

amounts deposited in trust with the Trustee (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will include accrued
and unpaid interest to the date fixed for redemption) prior to the date fixed for redemption, the
applicable redemption notice will state that Holders will receive such amounts deposited in trust with
the Trustee (i) on or promptly after the date fixed for redemption or (ii) such earlier payment date as
selected by the Issuer.

**_Mandatory Payment_**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar will select
Notes for redemption on a _pro rata basis or in accordance with the procedures of Clearstream or_
Euroclear (as applicable), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange or depository
requirements. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable to any person for
any selections made by it in accordance with this paragraph.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the
“Exchange”) and the rules of The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) so
require, the Issuer shall provide a copy of any notice of redemption to the Authority and, not less than
10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date (except as permitted below), mail such notice to
Holders of the Notes by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. In the case of
Global Notes, such notice of redemption may also be sent in accordance with the rules and procedures
of Clearstream or Euroclear (as applicable). On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue
on the Notes or the part of the Notes called for redemption.

If any of the Notes are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to the relevant
Notes shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion
of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Note, an appropriate
notation will be made on such Global Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal
to the unredeemed portion thereof.

Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for redemption (including with
the proceeds of an Equity Offering) become due on the date fixed for redemption. If such redemption
is subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, the related notice may, for the
avoidance of doubt, state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such
time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived (provided that in no event shall such date
of redemption be delayed to a date later than 60 days after the date on which such notice was sent), or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so
delayed. Notwithstanding anything else in the Indenture or the Notes to the contrary, redemption notices
may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a
defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior written notice to the Holders (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any,
to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all

Additional Amounts (as defined under “—Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts”), if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
any, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder)
or treaties of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding
_Taxes/Additional Amounts”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official position, regarding the application, administration
or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by reason of a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), the Issuer is, or on the next
interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect
to the Notes, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the
Issuer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would
be reasonable); provided that, such Change in Tax Law must not be formally announced before and
must become effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). For the avoidance
of doubt, neither ministerial decrees issued under the German law to defend tax evasion and unfair tax
competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) nor such law
or any such decrees becoming applicable on or after a delayed effective date shall be considered a
Change in Tax Law for purposes of this section.

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Issuer, after such successor
Issuer becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time
such successor Issuer becomes a party to the Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be
given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due, and the Change in
Tax Law giving rise to such obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect, or have a binding
effective date which falls before the payments giving rise to such obligation must be made, at the time
such notice is given. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that
it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that the Issuer cannot avoid its obligation to
pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Issuer
has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The
Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in
which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes/Additional Amounts**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the
Notes or with respect to any Note Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed
or levied by or on behalf of:

##### 204


-----

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on any such Note or Note Guarantee is
made by or on behalf of the Payor (including the jurisdiction of the Paying Agent) or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein; or

(2) Germany or any other jurisdiction in which any Payor is or was incorporated or organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident, or has a
permanent establishment, for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein,

(each of clause (1) through (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law
to be made by any applicable withholding agent in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor or the relevant Paying Agent with respect to any Note or any Note Guarantee, as applicable,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received by each beneficial owner of the Notes (i.e., the person treated as the owner of the
applicable payment for purposes of the applicable tax) in respect of such payments, after such
withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such additional amounts),
will equal the amounts which would have been received by such beneficial owner in respect of such
payments on any such Note or Note Guarantee, as applicable, in the absence of such withholding or
deduction (the “Additional Amounts”); provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be
payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note (or
between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner
is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or
disposition of such Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights
under such Note, the Indenture, a Note Guarantee, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or a Security Document;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request by the
Payor (or any other person acting on its behalf) addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice
at least 30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be made, to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or
identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or
satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction of, all or part of such Tax
but only to the extent the Holder or such beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such
certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed or withheld as a result of the presentation
of the Note for payment (where Notes are in the form of Definitive Registered Notes and
presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first made available
for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to
Additional Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding in respect of any
payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

##### 205


-----

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or other
governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version
of such sections that are substantively comparable), any regulations promulgated thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof, any intergovernmental agreement between a non U.S.
jurisdiction and the United States with respect to the foregoing (and any related law, regulation,
or official administrative guidance) implementing the foregoing;

(7) any Taxes imposed by Germany, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed or
withheld but for the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of a Note being resident in a “noncooperative tax jurisdiction” (nicht kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) as defined in the German
law to defend tax evasion and unfair tax competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung
_und unfairem Steuerwettbewerb) and ministerial decrees issued thereunder, as such law or_
decrees may be amended from time to time;

(8) any Tax imposed on or with respect to any payment to a holder that is a fiduciary, partnership
or other person other than the sole beneficial owner of such payment to the extent that such Tax
would not have been imposed on such payment had the beneficiary, partner or other beneficial
owner directly held the Note, provided that there is no material cost or material commercial or
legal restriction to transferring such Note to the beneficiary, partner or other beneficial owner
and only to the extent such Tax is imposed more than 90 days after the Issuer notifies such
holder of the imposition of such Tax and requests the holder to make such a transfer; or

(9) any combination of the items (1) through (8) above.

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, or the Paying Agent so required will (i) make or
cause to be made any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.

The Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted
or withheld to each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably
practicable to the Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon reasonable request
and will be made available at the offices of the relevant Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Note or any Note Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver
to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the
amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to
pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay
Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor
may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Trustee shall be
entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

##### 206


-----

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payors will pay and indemnify each holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court
or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties with
respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar Taxes or similar charges or levies (including
any related interest or penalties with respect thereto) that are imposed by any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or receipt of, any
Notes, any Note Guarantee, the Indenture, the Security Documents or any other document or instrument
in relation thereto (other than in each case, in respect of a transfer of the Notes by a holder after this
issuance of Notes) or, in each case, the receipt of any payments with respect thereto (limited solely in
the case of the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to taxes not excluded under clauses (1)
through (3) or (5) through (9)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and
any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to any
Payor and to any jurisdiction in which any such successor to a Payor is or was organized, engaged in
business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through
which any payment under, or with respect to the Notes (or any Note Guarantee) is made by or on behalf
of such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading
“Change of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any part
(equal to € 100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, if applicable; provided that Notes
of €100,000 may only be redeemed in whole and not in part) of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price
in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided, however,
that the Issuer shall not be obligated to repurchase any series of Notes as described under this heading,
_“Change_ _of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has unconditionally exercised its right to_
redeem all of the Notes of such series and given notice of redemption as described under “—Optional
_Redemption” and that all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived._

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes and given notice of
redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption” and all conditions to such redemption have
been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer
will deliver a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to
the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right
to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of
Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the
“Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than the later of (x)
60 days from the date such notice is mailed and (y) the date of completion of the change of
control) and the record date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

##### 207


-----

(3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease
to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control
Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue
interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change
of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will,
to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of
all Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate
principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change
of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been
tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

A Holder willing to tender Notes into the Change of Control Offer shall notify its account manager of
its election, who shall in turn notify the Paying Agent and the Trustee of such Holder’s election. Once
such tender has been accepted by the Issuer and notified to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall
promptly credit the bank account of such Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes so
tendered and deduct the corresponding amount of such Notes from such Holder’s Euroclear or
Clearstream (as applicable) account.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event
of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. Holders’ right to require the Issuer to repurchase
Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with
the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer
and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a

##### 208


-----

definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be
limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of
Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness at the option of each lender under the
Revolving Credit Facility.

Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture may
also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such
Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of
their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial
effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions,
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to
specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase
“substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether
a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change
of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as described above. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders”
expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change
of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders
of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers.”

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if, on the date of such Incurrence, after
giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
would have been at least 2.00 to 1.00 and (2) to the extent that the Indebtedness to be Incurred is Senior
Secured Indebtedness, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 5.70 to 1.00.

##### 209


-----

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to any Credit Facility
(including in respect of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder)
and any refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding
(i) the greater of €100 million and 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, plus (ii) in the case of any
refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof, the
aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses

Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
by another provision of this covenant; provided that, if the Indebtedness being guaranteed is
subordinated to the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be subordinated to the
Notes or such Note Guarantee to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed; and (b)
without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness arising
by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted
under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which_
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary and any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other
than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an
Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), the related
Note Guarantees and any “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement,

borrowing or utilization as in effect as of the Issue Date, after giving pro forma effect
to the Transactions;

clause (4), clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant; and

(5) Indebtedness of any Person (x) outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with
(including pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or (y) Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilized to
consummate the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary; _provided that Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this paragraph (5) is in an_
aggregate amount not to exceed (a) the greater of (i) €10 million and (ii) 10% of Consolidated
EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, plus (b) unlimited additional Indebtedness to the extent that
after giving pro forma effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related

##### 210


-----

Incurrence of Indebtedness, either (i) the Issuer would have been able to Incur €1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the first paragraph of this covenant or (ii) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would not be less
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the
related Incurrence of Indebtedness;

(6) Hedging Obligations (excluding Hedging Obligations entered into for speculative purposes (as
determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer));

rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal)
or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase
of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which
refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness, in an aggregate outstanding principal amount
which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this clause (a)(i) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time the greater of
€30 million and 30% of Consolidated EBITDA and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof (provided that, in each case, the Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease,
rental, construction, design, installation or improvement or is created within 270 days
thereafter) and (ii) in respect of real property and entered into or Incurred in connection with
either the development of, or expansion capital expenditure of, such real property for use in the
ordinary course of business of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries and any Refinancing Indebtedness

aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this sub-clause (b),
together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (b)
and then outstanding, shall not exceed the greater of €20 million and 20% of Consolidated
EBITDA at any time outstanding);

such Disqualified Stock was issued pursuant to clause (2) of the first paragraph above) issuable
upon the conversion or exchange of shares of Disqualified Stock issued in accordance with the
first paragraph above, and any refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto; provided that any
such Indebtedness issuable upon the conversion or exchange of shares of Disqualified Stock

of all obligations, or liquidation preference with respect to, such Disqualified Stock;

(14) Indebtedness (a) Incurred pursuant to factoring financings, reverse factoring financings,
securitizations, asset-backed loans and financings, receivables financings or similar

Undertakings) and (b) to the extent not covered in sub-clause (a), in respect of any Qualified
Receivables Financing or any Securitization Facility;

connection with or related to the disposal of Non-performing Leases;

the greater of €25 million and 25% of Consolidated EBITDA; and

(17) Indebtedness of (a) the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred to finance the Parc Brux

aggregate amount exceed the greater of €10 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA at any
time outstanding, when taken together with any refinancing Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to
this clause (17)(b)) in respect thereof.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness Incurred by Restricted
Subsidiaries which are not a Guarantor or the Issuer pursuant to the first paragraph and clause (5) of the
second paragraph of this covenant at any time outstanding shall not exceed the greater of €25 million

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, other than
Indebtedness which will continue to be secured on the Collateral and which benefits from
priority with respect to proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral pursuant to clause
(b)(iii) of the definition of Permitted Collateral Liens, and only be required to include the
amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant;

-----

(2) (a) all Indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Issue Date shall be
deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the
first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant and (b) any
Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred to finance the Parc Brux
joint venture that is outstanding on the Issue Date shall be deemed Incurred under clause (17)(a)
of the second paragraph of this covenant and not pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant
or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included, and for purposes of
determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a
Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean
down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that
Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this
covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the
date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (5), (7), (11), (12), (14), (15), (16) or (17) of the second paragraph above or the first
paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments
relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum
mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness and, for
the avoidance of doubt, certain types of obligations (for example Qualified Receivables
Financings) may not qualify as Indebtedness to the extent such obligations are excluded from
the definition of Indebtedness;

(7) for the purposes of determining “Consolidated EBITDA” in relation to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, Consolidated EBITDA shall be measured at the option of the Issuer
on the most recent date on which new commitments are obtained or the date on which new
Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of revolving facilities) or the date on which new
Indebtedness is Incurred (in the case of term facilities) and for the period of the most recent
four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to such date for which such internal consolidated
financial statements of the Issuer are available;

(8) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second
paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA at
the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction
shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing
Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus
premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance, costs and fees in connection with such
refinancing; and

##### 214


-----

(9) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will
be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will
not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be
(a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b)
the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this
“—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed or first Incurred
(whichever yields the lower Euro Equivalent), in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving
credit facility; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness_
denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro
denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such euro denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount
set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to euro) covering
principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro
will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded
solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any
Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the

satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case, due
within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other
acquisition or retirement and (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness”);

thereafter therefrom);

(b) the Issuer is not able to Incur an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause

succeeding paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(i) 50% of Consolidated Net Income for the period (treated as one accounting
period) from the first day of the fiscal quarter commencing immediately prior
to the Issue Date to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter ending prior to the

Income is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness
that has been converted into or exchanged for Capital Stock of the Issuer (other
than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding (plus the amount of any cash, and the fair market value
of property or assets or marketable securities received by the Issuer or any

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the_
preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included in any of the foregoing clauses
(iv), (v) or (vi); provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) any amounts (such amounts,

for Restricted Payments pursuant to the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such
amounts result from the receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or marketable securities received in contemplation
of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise constitute a Change of Control, (2) the purpose

no Change of Control Offer is made in connection with such Change of Control in accordance with the
requirements of the Indenture and (y) Excluded Amounts shall be limited to the amount of net cash

Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares), Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a
substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through a Designated Contribution, a

If a Parent Entity RP Loan is outstanding, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may distribute
the right to collect a payment under that loan or receivable to a Parent or write off, set off, discount,
surrender, cancel or forgive such loan or right to collect payment, and such distribution, write off, set
off, discount, surrender, cancellation or forgiveness shall not constitute a Restricted Payment.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be paid, transferred or issued by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment.

The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value
of any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by the Board of Directors of the
Issuer.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit the Third Party Security Provider or any Restricted
Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or
assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary and, in the case of the Third Party Security
Provider only to the extent that such property or assets constitute Collateral), whether owned on the
Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which
Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property
or asset that does not constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that
are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of
Guarantors) are directly secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles (but without regard to any
Agreed Security Principles limiting the types or locations of assets that may be pledged to secure the
Notes and the Note Guarantees under the Indenture), equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of
Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so
long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes
Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to clause (a)(2) of the preceding paragraph will
be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the
Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under “—Security—Release of Liens.”

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay
any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(b) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

##### 223


-----

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Revolving
Credit Facility) and any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered into
on the Issue Date, (b) the Indenture, the Notes, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Documents or any related security documents or (c) any other agreement or instrument with

to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which
such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or was designated as a Restricted Subsidiary or on which
such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as
consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate, the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined
with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of this clause (2), if
another Person is the Successor Issuer (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any
Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be
deemed acquired or assumed by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person
becomes the Successor Issuer;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument that extends, renews,
refinances or replaces any of the encumbrances or restrictions referred to in clauses (1) or (2)
of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in any amendment,
supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clauses (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing
or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment
or transfer of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under
the Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
permitted under the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict
the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges or
other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease
Obligations permitted under the Indenture, in each case, that impose encumbrances or
restrictions on the property so acquired in the nature of clause (c) of the preceding paragraph,
or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

##### 224


-----

or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or
disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction) pending the closing of
such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licenses, joint venture agreements and other similar agreements
and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or any applicable
rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority or any governmental licenses,
concessions, franchises or permits, including restrictions or encumbrances on cash or deposits
(including assets in escrow accounts) paid on property;

(9) any encumbrance or restriction on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers or
suppliers, or as required by insurance, surety or bonding companies or indemnities, in each
case, under agreements or policies entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements or
Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument (a) relating to
any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the
provisions of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” if (i) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole
are not materially less favorable to the Holders of the Notes than (A) the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, together with the security
documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on
the Issue Date or (B) as is customary in comparable financings (as determined by the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Issuer) or (ii) the Issuer determines at the time of the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness that such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any
material respect, the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b)
that constitutes an Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the
determination of the Board of Directors or an Officer of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable
to effect such Qualified Receivables Financing; or

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under “—Limitation on
_Liens.”_

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Disposition
is not less than the fair market value of the assets sold (as determined by the Board of Directors
of the Issuer); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Disposition consists of:

(a) cash (including any cash or Cash Equivalents received or reasonably expected by the
Issuer to be received, from the conversion, within 180 days of such Asset Disposition,

##### 225


-----

of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(b) Cash Equivalents;

(c) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries recorded on the Issuer’s consolidated balance sheet or the notes thereto
(or, if Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the
next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither
the Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains directly or indirectly obligated
or liable in respect of such liabilities or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that
is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Issuer
and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any guarantee of such
Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(d) Replacement Assets;

(e) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (4) or (6) in the second
paragraph of this covenant;

(f) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor received from
Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that
such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor
and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Guarantor;

(g) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any
one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €15 million and 15% of Consolidated
EBITDA (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to
subsequent changes in value); or

(h) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (a) through (g) of this clause
(2).

If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, the Net Available Cash
of the Asset Disposition, within 365 days of the later of (i) the date of the consummation of such Asset
Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary to:

(1) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof; provided, however, that, in connection with any prepayment,
repayment, purchase or redemption of term Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to such clause (1),
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such term Indebtedness and will cause the
related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal
amount so prepaid, repaid, purchased or redeemed; (ii) unless included in the preceding clause
(1)(i), offers to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any series of Notes, any other series of Notes
and/or any other Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari
_passu basis with the Notes, with respect to such other Indebtedness, at a price of no more than_
the principal amount of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
Additional Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to the date of
such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and with respect to any series of Notes,
at a price of no less than 100% of the principal amount of the applicable series of Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, Additional Amounts and applicable redemption premium, if any,

##### 226


-----

to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (iii) prepay, repay,
purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any
Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case
other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); provided that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary shall
prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Indebtedness (other than the Notes) pursuant to clause (ii)
only if the Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders
to purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes equal to the proportion that (x)
the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to (y) the total aggregate
principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total aggregate principal amount outstanding of
such Indebtedness (other than the Notes);

(2) (a) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant interest payment date) or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of
the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below), (b) redeem any series of Notes
pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture or (c) make open market repurchases of
the Notes;

(3) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(4) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Similar Business,
if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Similar Business is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make a capital expenditure;

(6) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(7) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(8) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (1), (2)(ii),
(3), (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph or a combination thereof; _provided that a binding_
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date
of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated
and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period, if the
investment has not been consummated by that date;

_provided, that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may elect to invest pursuant to clause (3), (4), (5) or_
(6) of the above paragraph prior to receiving the Net Available Cash (provided that such investment
shall be made no earlier than the earliest of notice to the Trustee of the relevant Asset Disposition,
execution of a definitive agreement for the relevant Asset Disposition or consummation of the relevant
Asset Disposition) and deem the amount so invested to be applied pursuant to and in accordance with
clause (3), (4), (5) or (6).

100% of any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed
to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph (or, if the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio is equal to or less than 5.80 to 1.00 but greater 5.30 to 1.00, 50% of such Net Available Cash, or
if the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 5.30 to 1.00, 0% of such Net Available
Cash) will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds” under the Indenture. Pending the final application
of any such Net Available Cash, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or

##### 227


-----

otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the
Indenture. On the 366th day after an Asset Disposition or such earlier time if the Issuer elects, if the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €20 million and 20% of Consolidated
EBITDA, the Issuer will be required to make within 30 Business Days thereof an offer (an “Asset
_Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding_
Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes,
to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which
the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price
in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any such Pari Passu Indebtedness, an
offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes and 100% of the principal
amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, Additional
Amounts and applicable prepayment or redemption premium, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the agreements governing such
Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable); provided that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior to the end of the 365 day period.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for any purpose not prohibited by the terms of the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer
by Holders and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively,
exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and
such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be repaid or purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate
principal amount of tendered Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating
the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be
calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date
selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in
a currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary upon converting such
portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later
than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset
_Disposition Purchase Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent_
it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset
_Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly_
tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition
Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and
Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer
Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (if applicable). The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Paying Agent shall deliver to the Holders of Notes
the purchase price of Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn and arrange for the deduction of the
appropriate amounts of Notes from such Holders’ accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream (as

##### 228


-----

applicable). Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book
entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to
the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations
and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value
in excess of the greater of €10 million and 10% of Consolidated EBITDA unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction on an arm’s length basis at the time of such transaction or the execution
of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s length dealings with a Person who is
not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
€15 million and 15% of Consolidated EBITDA, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a resolution of the majority of the Disinterested Directors
of the Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause_
(9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in_
paragraphs (1)(b), (2), (11), (14), (15) and (22) of the definition thereof) or any distribution,
write off, set off, discount, surrender, cancellation or forgiveness of a Parent Entity RP Loan;

(2) any issuance, transfer or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or
the funding of, or entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective
bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar
agreement and other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase
Capital Stock of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, longterm incentive plans, profit sharing plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or
similar employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the
Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), between or among Restricted

-----

Subsidiaries or between or among the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Receivables
Subsidiary in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses
provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person
owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (a) the Transactions, (b) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by,
and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect
as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified,
supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with
the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any
material respect, (c) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement and (d) the performance of any obligations of the Issuer or any of the Restricted

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) of the Issuer or an

**_Reports_**

So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the first such report, 150 days) after the end of each of the
Issuer’s fiscal years beginning with the year ended December 31, 2021, annual reports

provided in a previous report pursuant to clause (2) or (3) below); provided that such pro forma
financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable
expense, in which case the Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired
company financial information; (c) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Issuer as of
the end of the most recent two fiscal years and audited consolidated income statements and
statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate

##### 231


-----

(2) within 60 days (or, in the case of the first such report, 90 days) following the end of the first,
second and third fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer, beginning with the quarter
ending June 30, 2021, unaudited quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (a) the Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of
such quarter and unaudited condensed statement of income and cash flow information for the
most recent quarter year to date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date
and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited
_pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Issuer, together with_
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have

only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Issuer will provide,
in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financial information); (c) an operating
and financial discussion of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the

material changes to the operational risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report;
_provided that the information described in clauses (d) and (e) may be provided in the footnotes_
to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuer announces publicly or any
acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries or the Issuer, taken as a whole, or a senior executive
officer or director changes at the Issuer or a change in auditors of the Issuer, a report containing
a description of such event.

Following an Initial Public Offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity and/or the listing of such
Capital Stock on a recognized European or United States stock exchange, the requirements of clause
(1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the
reporting requirements of such stock exchange; provided that (x) the IPO Entity shall provide financial
statements consistent with the requirements of clause (2) above for the first three quarterly periods in
each fiscal year after the Issue Date and (y) to the extent such IPO Entity relies on such stock exchange
reporting requirements to fulfill the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above, a reasonably detailed
description of such material differences between the financial statements of such IPO Entity and the
financial statements of the Issuer shall be included for any period after the Issue Date.

The Issuer shall also make available to holders and prospective holders of the Notes copies of all reports
furnished to the Trustee on the Issuer’s website and if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Official
List of the Exchange and to the extent that the rules and regulations of the Authority so require, copies
of such reports furnished to the Trustee will also be made available at the specified office of the Issuer.

In addition, the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such
parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities
Act for so long as the Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not
“affiliates” under the U.S. Securities Act.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information;
_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a_
change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. No report need include
separate financial statements for any Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the
results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum. The Issuer may comply with any requirement to provide reports or financial statements

##### 232


-----

required by this covenant by providing any report or financial statement of a direct or indirect Parent of
the Issuer.

In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

For purposes of this covenant, an acquisition or disposition shall be deemed to be material if the entity
or business acquired or disposed of represents greater than 20% of the Issuer’s (a) total revenue or
Consolidated EBITDA for the most recent four quarters for which annual or quarterly financial reports
have been delivered to the Trustee or (b) consolidated assets as of the last day of the most recent quarter
for which annual or quarterly financial reports have been delivered to the Trustee.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary
of the Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this
“Reports” covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial
statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this “Reports” covenant shall be made in the English language.

In the event that (i) the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d)
of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC, or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of GAAP information,
certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the
Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports
that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d).
Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

At its election, the Issuer may provide consolidated financial statements of (x) one of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or (y) a Parent, in each case, in lieu of those for the Issuer, in which case references to the
Issuer in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of the preceding paragraph will be deemed to be references to such
Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent, as applicable; provided that if the consolidated financial statements
of such Restricted Subsidiary or the Parent, as the case may be, are included in such report, a qualitative
description of material differences between the consolidated financial statements of such Restricted
Subsidiary or the Parent, as the case may be, and the Issuer shall be included for any period after the
Issue Date.

Delivery of any information, documents and reports to the Trustee pursuant to this “Reports” covenant
is for information purposes only and shall not constitute constructive notice of any information
contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety or substantially
as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) either the Issuer is the surviving entity, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the
“Successor Issuer”) will be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state

##### 233


-----

of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, any State of the United
States of America or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada and the
Successor Issuer (if not the Issuer) will expressly assume (a) by supplemental indenture,
executed and delivered to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Successor Issuer as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Issuer or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Issuer or the Successor Issuer
would be able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1) of the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Issuer or the Successor Issuer for the most recently ended four
full fiscal quarters for which financial statements of the Issuer are available immediately
preceding the date on which the transaction is consummated would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture
(if any is required in connection with such transaction) comply with the Indenture, and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly
authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable
against the Successor Issuer (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee).

Without prejudice to clause (3) in the immediately preceding paragraph, any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any
Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction
undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Indebtedness.”_

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be
the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Issuer will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture, but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets, the
predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of a Person.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose Note Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

##### 234


-----

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the
surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets
as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(a) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or
becomes a Guarantor substantially concurrently with such consolidation, merger, sale,
assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposal;

(b) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or
transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its
Note Guarantee and the Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and
delivered) and all obligations of the Guarantor under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable; and (2)
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; and

(c) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation
or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Indenture;

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall not apply to the extent_
that compliance with clauses (a) and (c)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors
or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of
the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect
to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses.

The provisions set forth in this “Merger and Consolidation” covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor from consolidating with,
merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer,
a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor; (ii) any Guarantor
from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer or
another Guarantor; (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if
the Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume
the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, and clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading
“—The Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; or (iv) the Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or
merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form
of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Issuer” or
clauses (3)(a) and (3)(b) under the heading “—The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any
such transaction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on

##### 235


-----

that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade
Status (the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions
will not apply to the Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(6) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(7) “—Limitation on Additional Guarantees”; and

(8) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Issuer,”_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not
be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during
the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute
a Default or Event of Default. The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as
if it has been in effect since the date of the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension
Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension
Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted
under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.” In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default,_
the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions
in the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the
contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the
Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.

The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under
this caption have been satisfied; _provided that no such notification shall be a condition for the_
suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that
the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit the Third Party Security Provider or any Restricted
Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to
the paragraph below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be
deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit the Third Party Security
Provider or any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in
any of the Collateral.

##### 236


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Third Party Security Provider, the Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens, (ii) the Collateral may be discharged and released
in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (iii) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from
time to time to (a) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency
therein; (b) to comply with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (c) to add Collateral, (d) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or any
security provider and the assumption of such successor of the obligations under the Indenture, the Notes,
the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Security Documents, in each case, including in accordance with
the terms under “—Merger and Consolidation,” (e) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent and (f) in any manner that does not adversely
affect Holders of the Notes in any material respect; (iv) the Third Party Security Provider, the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may discharge and release Security Interests with respect to the
Collateral in connection with the implementation of a Permitted Reorganization and (v) the Security
Interests, and the related Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or released (followed by an immediate retaking of a Lien of at
least equivalent ranking over the same assets); provided, however, that in the case of clause (v) above,
the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released or
otherwise modified or replaced; unless, contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to
the Trustee either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the the Issuer and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of
Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, which
confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release,
modification or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the
Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, as so amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released, modified or replaced, are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation,
imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, to which such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
release, modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this
covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such amendments without the need for
instructions from the Holders.

**_Limitation on Additional Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary shall Guarantee the Indebtedness outstanding under any Credit Facility
relating to Indebtedness (including the Revolving Credit Facility) or any Public Debt of the Issuer or a
Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary (a) is the Issuer or a Guarantor or (b) becomes a Guarantor
on the date on which such Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted
Subsidiary will provide a Note Guarantee; provided, however, that such Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be obligated to become such a Guarantor to the extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Note
Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to or could give
rise to or result in:

(1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance,
fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and
coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable
jurisdiction;

##### 237


-----

(2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
or

(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than
reasonable out of pocket expenses. At the option of the Issuer, any Note Guarantee may contain
limitations on Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain
defenses generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance
or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or
similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law.

Note Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—The Note
_Guarantees—Note Guarantees Release.” A Note Guarantee, granted pursuant to this provision, of a_
Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding under the Revolving Facility Agreement and there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been
Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor had not been
designated as a Guarantor.

The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of
releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
reasonably requested by the Issuer to effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with
these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured
to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—Each Note Guarantee and security may be subject to_
_certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses_
_that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests.”_

**Financial Calculations**

When calculating the satisfaction of, or availability under, any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in
each case, in connection with any acquisition, disposition, merger, joint venture, Investment,
Incurrence, Change of Control or other similar transaction where there is a time difference between
commitment and closing or Incurrence (including in respect of Incurrence of Indebtedness, Liens,
Restricted Payments, Permitted Payments or Investments and in determining whether an event
constitutes a Specified Change of Control), the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any
Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements
(including any commitment letter subject to full documentation) for such acquisition, disposition,
merger, joint venture, investment, Incurrence, Change of Control or similar transaction are entered into
and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and
consistent with the pro forma provisions set forth in the definition of Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio after giving effect to such transaction and other transactions to be
entered into in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable period for purposes of determining the
ability to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any
basket or ratio).

For the avoidance of doubt, (1) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of
fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated Net Income,

##### 238


-----

Consolidated EBITDA, Indebtedness, Senior Secured Indebtedness, Consolidated Net Leverage or cash
and Cash Equivalents of the Issuer or the target company or asset subject to such transaction) subsequent
to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction, such
baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or unsatisfied as a result of such fluctuations
solely for purposes of determining whether the transactions are permitted hereunder and (2) such
baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of consummation of such transaction or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the time of
entry into such definitive agreement (including any commitment letter subject to full documentation),
any such transactions (including any Restricted Payment, Permitted Investment, Asset Disposition,
Change of Control or Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to
have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes
of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the
consummation of such transactions.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and
payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 continuous days (or, in the
case of an obligation set out in “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” 120 continuous days) after
notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding
Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue
Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
(“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross_acceleration provision”),_

and in each case, either (i) the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default
or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €15 million or more or (ii) such
Indebtedness is Incurred pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and secured by Collateral
that is accorded priority status over the Notes with respect to the application of proceeds of
enforcement of Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement, upon any instruction by an
Instructing Group (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to commence enforcement of the
Collateral in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt,
failure to pay rent or any other lease expense (howsoever defined and whether or not due at
such time) shall not constitute an Event of Default under this clause (4);

##### 239


-----

(5) other than on a solvent basis, certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of
the Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €15 million
(exclusive of any amounts for which a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final (the “judgment default provision”);

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) with
respect to a material portion of the Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full
of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall assert in
writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and any such Default
continues for 10 days; and

(8) any Note Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of such Note Guarantee or the Indenture) or is declared invalid or
unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its
obligations under its Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee, by notice to the Issuer, or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of
the outstanding Notes under the Indenture, by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the
Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and
unpaid interest on all the Notes under the Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration,
such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the
event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4)
under the definition of “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default
triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the
holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court
of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal,
premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have
been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may
not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement
or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture by notice
to the Trustee may, on behalf of all Holders, waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default
(except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and

##### 240


-----

rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers
under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered
to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, fees, liability or
expense.

No Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing
for the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holder has offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against
any loss, fees, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request
and the offer of such security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the
Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60 day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes
are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will
provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a responsible
officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its
powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled
to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, fees, liabilities
and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default,
the Trustee will have no obligation to monitor compliance by the Issuer with the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed in writing
of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60
days after being so notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of,
or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee
determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (and with respect to the fiscal year
ending on December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate
indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their
status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”), then at the time such Initial Default is cured,
such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default

##### 241


-----

will also be cured without any further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to
comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or
otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery (prior to acceleration in respect of the relevant breach) of any
such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery
is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Indenture will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain
circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified or secured to its satisfaction. It may not be possible
for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances
the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will
be for Holders to take action directly.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, Notes).

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or in the case of clause (8) below,
75%) of the then outstanding principal amount of the Notes (provided, however, that if any amendment,
supplement, waiver or other modification or consent will only affect the Fixed Rate Notes or the
Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, only the consent of the holders of at least 90% (or, in the case of
clause (8) below, 75%) of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate Notes or
Floating Rate Notes, as applicable, will be required), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to
any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of such Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described under “—Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in currency other than that stated in the Note;

(6) amend the contractual right expressly set forth in the Indenture of any Holder of any outstanding
Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment of principal of, or interest or Additional
Amounts on, if any, such Holder’s Notes after the applicable due date therefor;

(7) [Reserved];

(8) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in
the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of

##### 242


-----

acceleration of such Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release all or substantially all of the Guarantors from their obligations under the Note
Guarantees or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, following an IPO (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) the Note
Guarantee of a Guarantor and the release of the security interest over the Collateral may be released
with the consent of the requisite creditors under the Intercreditor Agreement as further described under
“Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required consents—
_Provisions following an IPO.”_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Security
Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) to add to the covenants or provide for a Note Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or
surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the
Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the
Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) to make such provisions as necessary (as determined by the Board of Directors or an Officer of
the Issuer) for the issuance of Additional Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Note Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—
_Limitation on Additional Guarantees,” to add Note Guarantees with respect to the Notes, to add_
security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Note Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security
Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Notes when
such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the
_Notes” was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security_
Documents or the Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor trustee or
security agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee
or Security Agent to any Notes Document;

##### 243


-----

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged
or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent,
or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any
Person; provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or

(10) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall be
entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer’s
Certificates and Opinions of Counsel. The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture
to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if
such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or
waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraphs above, in order to effect an amendment
authorized by clause (3) above to add a Guarantor under the Indenture, it shall only be necessary for the
supplemental indenture providing for the accession of such additional Guarantor to be duly authorized
and executed by (i) the Issuer, (ii) such additional Guarantor and (iii) the Trustee. Any other
amendments permitted by the Indenture need only be duly authorized and executed by the Issuer and
the Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable).

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of (1) any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect of
Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1) the Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly
authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a
restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially
the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders),
including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Note Guarantees and
priority and release of the Security Interests; provided that (1) such Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the
Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of
the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and (2) if more than
one such intercreditor agreement is outstanding at any one time, the collective terms of such
intercreditor agreements must not conflict.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders,
the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any
Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, manifest error or inconsistency
of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement
that may be Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement
(including, with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3)
add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement,
(4) further secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable
pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7)

##### 244


-----

amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the
terms thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the
Holders in any material respect. In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall be entitled to request and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems appropriate, including
an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel. The Issuer shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or
the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of
the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as
otherwise permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers,” and the Issuer may only direct the
Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not
impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities or immunities under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and the Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of
the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”
and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed
to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described
herein), and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day
upon prior written request at the offices of the Issuer.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries, or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Issuer, will be considered as though not outstanding, except that for the purposes of determining whether
the Trustee will be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes that a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee actually knows are so owned will be so disregarded. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Independent Debt Fund shall not be considered to be a Person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer and each Guarantor under the Notes
and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except
for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties,
immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and
obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments
held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security
Documents and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the
defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Restricted Subsidiaries’ obligations under the covenants
described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (4) under “—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating_

##### 245


-----

to such covenants described under “—Events of Default” above, the operation of the payment default,
the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provision with respect to any Significant Subsidiaries,
the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision described
under “—Events of Default” (“covenant defeasance”).

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to
clauses (1), (2) and (4) of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Issuer”), (4), (5) (with respect only to the Significant Subsidiaries), (6), (7) or (8)_
under “—Events of Default.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
“defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee
for this purpose) cash in euro or euro denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof sufficient for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes to redemption
or maturity, as the case may be, provided that, if requested by the Issuer, the Trustee will distribute any
amounts deposited in trust to the Holders prior to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case
may be.

In addition, the Issuer must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that beneficial owners of the relevant
Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same
amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such
deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion
of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling received by the Issuer from, or
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject
to customary assumptions and qualifications), each stating that all conditions precedent
provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have
been complied with; and

(4) all other documents or other information that the Trustee may reasonably require in connection
with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of
further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes
previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain
Notes for which provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released
to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously
delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due
and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one

##### 246


-----

year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption
by the Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused
to be deposited with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), with respect to the Notes, money or euro denominated European Government
Obligations, or a combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes not previously delivered to the Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal,
premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and
payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or
caused to be paid all other sums payable under the Indenture; (4) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the
Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and (5) the Issuer has delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (provided that such counsel may not be an
employee of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the
“Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).
If requested in writing by the Issuer to the Trustee and Paying Agent (which request may be included
in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the above referenced Officer’s Certificate) no later
than three (3) Business Days prior to such distribution, the Trustee shall distribute any amounts
deposited to the Holders prior to Stated Maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. For the
avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the maturity or redemption date as
set forth above shall not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break cost or any
additional premium on such amounts. To the extent the Notes are represented by a global note deposited
with a depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding interests as a
participant of such clearing system shall be subject to the then applicable procedures of the clearing
system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any Guarantor under the
Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release
are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is
against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture
will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer
of the Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically
in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the
Trustee has written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs.
The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the
Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor
of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in
respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee or any agent under the Indenture will
be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed and replaced.
Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders

of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Issuer, and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest
that is not eliminated, or (b) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt,
then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, Taxes
or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

If and for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and if and to the
extent the rules of the Authority so require, the Issuer will notify the Authority of any notice to the
Holders of the Notes and, in connection with any redemption, the Issuer will notify the Authority of
any change in the principal amount of the Notes outstanding. In addition, for so long as any Notes are
represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered by or on behalf of the
Issuer to Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or; if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; _provided that, if_
notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and
the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed
to such Person by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such
Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder
or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or
communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it. If a notice or communication is given in via Euroclear or Clearstream, it is duly given on
the day the notice is given to Euroclear or Clearstream.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the
Notes will be prescribed ten (10) years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against
the Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Notes will be prescribed six (6) years
after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro Denominated Restrictions**

The sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer with respect to the Notes
is euro. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (whether as a result of, or the
enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of
the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the holder in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it
from the Issuer will constitute a discharge of the Issuer only to the extent of the euro amount which the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date
of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not possible to make that purchase on that date, on the first date
on which it is possible to do so). If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due
to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against any loss sustained by it
as a result. In any event the Issuer will indemnify the recipient against the cost of making any such
purchase.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any euro
denominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent for purposes hereof that is denominated in a

##### 248


-----

currency other than euro shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date such non euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Listing**

Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission to be
granted to deal in the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or that permission to deal in the Notes
thereon will be granted, and settlement of the Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing or
permission.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or the Guarantors, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and
any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within
the United States. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Structure and the Financing—Each Note
_Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_
_by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and_
“Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the Security Interests.”

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the
federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New
York, United States. The Indenture will provide that the Issuer and each Guarantor will appoint an agent
for service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the Indenture, the Notes and the
Guarantees brought in any U.S. federal or New York state court located in the City of New York.

**Governing Law**

_Ratio Calculation Date”), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro forma_
effect (as determined by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Issuer), including in respect
of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and synergies reasonably expected to occur within 24
months, to such Incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or

Date pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness” or (ii) the discharge on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio Calculation_
Date of any Indebtedness to the extent that such discharge results from the proceeds Incurred pursuant
to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio:

(1) acquisitions or Investments (each, a “Purchase”) that have been made by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, including through mergers or consolidations, or by any Person or

given pro forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial
officer of the Issuer), including in respect of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and
synergies reasonably expected to occur within 24 months, as if they had occurred on the first
day of the four quarter reference period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been
entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be
made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro
forma effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and
synergies reasonably expected to occur within 24 months) as if such Purchase had occurred on
the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date
of determination;

basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account
anticipated cost savings resulting from any such disposal, as determined by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in
accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or
operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition
occurred on the first day of such period, but only to the extent that the obligations giving rise
to such Consolidated Interest Expense will not be obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries following the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio Calculation
Date will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference
period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
Calculation Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during
such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness
will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio Calculation
Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate
Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness), and if any Indebtedness is not denominated in the
Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of Consolidated
Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with IFRS; and

(7) the full run rate effect of cost savings, expense reductions and synergies (as determined in good
faith by an Officer of the Issuer responsible for accounting or financial reporting) anticipated
to result from actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be included as

of the relevant period, net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period from
such actions, _provided that such cost savings, expense reductions and synergies reasonably_
expected to occur within 24 months (A) are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable
and (B) are not duplicative of any cost savings, expense reductions and synergies already
included for such period.

ownership of Restricted Subsidiaries, during the four quarter reference period or subsequent to
such reference period and on or prior to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, or
that are to be made on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, will be given pro
forma effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of
such Person), including in respect of anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and synergies
reasonably expected to occur within 24 months, as if they had occurred on the first day of the
four quarter reference period; provided that, if definitive documentation has been entered into
with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a calculation to be made
hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro forma
effect to such Purchase (including anticipated cost savings, expense reductions and synergies
reasonably expected to occur within 24 months) as if such Purchase had occurred on the first
day of such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of
determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued
operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, and operations, businesses or group of
assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of
prior to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma
basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account

anticipated cost savings resulting from such disposition, as determined in good faith by a

(3) the Fixed Charges attributable to discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with
IFRS, and operations or businesses (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date, will be excluded, but only to the extent that the
obligations giving rise to such Fixed Charges will not be obligations of the specified Person or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date
will be deemed to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such four quarter period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation
Date will be deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such four
quarter period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest and is being given pro forma effect, the
interest expense on such Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire period
(taking into account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness) and if any
Indebtedness is not denominated in the Issuer’s functional currency, that Indebtedness for
purposes of the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage shall be treated in accordance with
IFRS;

(7) interest on a Capitalized Lease Obligation shall be deemed to accrue at an interest rate
reasonably determined by a responsible financial or accounting officer of the Issuer to be the
rate of interest implicit in such Capitalized Lease Obligation in accordance with IFRS; and

to occur within 24 months (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial
Officer) shall be included as though such cost savings, expense reductions and synergies had
been achieved on the first day of the relevant period, net of the amount of actual benefits
realized during such period from such actions; provided such cost savings, expense reductions
and synergies (A) are reasonably identifiable and factually supportable and (B) are not
duplicative of any costs savings, expense reductions or synergies already included for the
period.

to disregard the foregoing and treat all leases, concessions or licenses of property as they would have
been treated under IFRS giving effect to the application of IFRS 16 (Leases), but any such election,
once made, shall be irrevocable and all ratios, calculations and determinations based upon IFRS (or, as
applicable, U.S. GAAP) shall be made giving effect to such election.

extent such reimbursement obligations relate to trade payables or other obligations not

##### BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM

**General**

Notes sold within the United States to “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on Rule 144A will
initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Fixed
Rate Notes (the “Fixed Rate Rule 144A Global Note”) and the Rule 144A Global Note representing the
Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate Rule 144A Global Note”) will be deposited with a common
depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Notes sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially
be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On
the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Note representing the Fixed Rate Notes (the “Fixed Rate
Regulation S Global Note” and, together with the Fixed Rate Rule 144A Global Note, the “Fixed Rate
Global Notes”) and the Regulation S Global Note representing the Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating
Rate Regulations S Global Note” and, together with the Floating Rate Rule 144A Global Note, the
“Floating Rate Global Notes”) will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name
of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with
the 144A Book- Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their participants. The
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s
account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability
to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners
of interests in the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form (subject to very limited exceptions) and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holder” of the Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the holder of the Notes for all purposes
under the Indenture. As such, participants and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and, in the case of indirect participants, the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests, in order to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent or the
Registrar, nor any of their respective agents, will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of
the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

##### 292


-----

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days;

(2) if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an Event of Default under the Indenture (as
defined therein); or

(3) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest
described in the immediately preceding clause (3), their current procedure is to request that we issue or
cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
holders and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indenture, unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

In the case of the issue of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Definitive Registered Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial
transfer or a partial redemption of one Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable, in respect of the balance of the holding not
transferred or redeemed; provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in
denominations of €100,000 or in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are
mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and
the Trustee or an authenticating agent appointed by the Trustee will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We or the Trustee may require
a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient
in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee or the Paying Agent appointed
pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note
is replaced. We and/or the Trustee may charge for expenses in replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions
of the Indenture, we, in our discretion, may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer
Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation
Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of
any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered

##### 293


-----

holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time
at the registered office of the Issuer or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and such registration is
a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the BookEntry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the
holders of the Book- Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of
the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis
as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided,
_however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 principal amount at maturity, may be_
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying
Agent will, in turn, make such payments to Euroclear and Clearstream, which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture governing the Notes, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the
registered holder of the Global Notes (for example, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective
nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent or
the Calculation Agent, nor any of their respective agents, has or will have any responsibility or liability
for:

- any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

- payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

- Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

- the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in “street name.”

##### 294


-----

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any
regulations of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the
Initial Purchasers, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent and the Registrar, nor
any of their respective agents, will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any
commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or
rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange
risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of (i) the
Fixed Rate Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream
in euro and (ii) the Floating Rate Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the BookEntry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such
direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event
of Default under the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global
Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer
its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

Beneficial interests in a 144A Global Note may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note denominated in the same currency only
upon receipt by the Trustee of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A
or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

For the avoidance of doubt, (i) no Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Note and no Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate Global Notes may be
transferred or exchanged for any Book-Entry Interest in any Floating Rate Global Note or any Definitive
Registered Note issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate Global Notes (the
“Definitive Registered Floating Rate Notes”), and (ii) no Book-Entry Interest in the Floating Rate
Global Notes and no Definitive Registered Floating Rate Note may be transferred or exchanged for any
Book-Entry Interest in any Fixed Rate Global Note or any Definitive Registered Note issued in
exchange for a Book-Entry Interest in the Fixed Rate Global Notes (the “Definitive Registered Fixed
Rate Notes”).

##### 295


-----

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be
transferred and exchanged as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any
Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer,
cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest
in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any,
and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it
retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under “Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only
if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar a written certificate
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate
transfer restrictions applicable to such notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial
Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar,
nor any of their respective agents, are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, and they also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book- entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear and Clearstream systems
will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear and Clearstream
participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange.
Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be
effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating
procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be

##### 296


-----

discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustee, the Transfer Agent, the Paying Agent, the Calculation Agent or the Registrar, nor any of their
respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their
participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the Issue Date against payment for value on the
Issue Date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are
open for business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors
who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes,
on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

##### CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS

_The information provided below does not purport to be a complete analysis of the tax law and practice_
_currently applicable in Germany and the United States, and does not purport to address the tax_
_consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which may be subject to special rules._

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult with their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences of a purchase of Notes including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of_
_interest and premium paid (if any), and the sale or redemption of the Notes or any interest therein._

_The discussion set forth below is based upon law as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum_
_and is subject to any change in such law that may take effect after such date. Terms defined in the_
_sections below only have such meanings as defined therein for such respective section. The discussion_
_assumes that the Notes will be issued, and any transfers thereof will be made, in accordance with the_
_Indenture._

_The discussion below is a general summary and is not tax advice. It does not cover all tax matters that_
_may be of importance to a particular investor._

**_Each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisor about the federal, state, local and_**
**_foreign tax consequences relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes in light of_**
**_the investor’s own circumstances._**

**Certain German Tax Considerations**

The following is a general discussion of certain German tax consequences of the acquisition, holding
and disposal of the Notes. It does not purport to be a comprehensive description of all German tax
considerations that may be relevant to a decision to purchase Notes and, in particular, does not consider
any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular purchaser. This summary is based on
the tax laws of Germany currently in force and as applied on the date of this Offering Memorandum,
which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect.

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, including (but not limited to)
the effect of any state or local or church taxes under the tax laws of Germany and any country of which
they are residents or whose tax laws apply to them for other reasons.

**_Withholding Tax_**

Ongoing interest payments received by a holder of the Notes who is a German tax resident (meaning,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat or place of effective management and control
is located in Germany) may be subject to German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer) if the Notes
are entered in a public debt register or in a foreign register or via which global certificates within the
meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or partial bonds have been issued and
provided that the Notes are held in custody with or administered by or presented for an over-the-counter
payment to (i) certain domestic banks or certain domestic financial services institution (generally
including a German branch of a non-German bank or financial services institution), (ii) a domestic
securities trading company, (iii) a domestic securities trading bank, or (iv) — in rather exceptional cases
if no German bank or financial services institution is the disbursing agent — the Issuer (each, a
“Disbursing Agent,” auszahlende Stelle). The withholding tax rate to be withheld by the Disbursing
Agent is 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon, the total withholding being 26.375%,
plus church tax, if applicable). Church tax will be collected by the Disbursing Agent by way of
withholding unless the holder has filed a blocking notice (Sperrvermerk) with the German Federal
Central Tax Office (Bundeszentralamt für Steuern) in which case the holders will have to include the
income in the tax return and will then be assessed for church tax.

##### 298


-----

The same treatment applies to capital gains (meaning, the difference between the proceeds from the
disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of Notes as described above after deduction of expenses
directly related to the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment and the cost of acquisition taking
into account currency gains and losses, if any) and interest accrued on the Notes (“Accrued Interest,”
_Stückzinsen) derived by a holder who is a German tax resident irrespective of any holding period,_
provided that the Notes have been held in a custodial account with the same Disbursing Agent since the
time of their acquisition. If interest coupons or interest claims are disposed of separately (meaning,
without the Notes), the proceeds from the disposition are subject to withholding tax. The same applies
to proceeds from the redemption of interest coupons or the payment of interest claims if the Notes have
been disposed of separately.

To the extent that the Notes have not been kept or administered in a custodial account with the same
Disbursing Agent since the time of their acquisition, upon their disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment withholding tax applies at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge at a rate of 5.5% thereon,
the total withholding being 26.375%, plus church tax, if applicable) on 30% of the disposal proceeds
(plus Accrued Interest, if any), unless the current Disbursing Agent has been provided with evidence of
the actual acquisition costs of the Notes by the previous Disbursing Agent or by a statement of a bank
or financial services institution within the European Union, the European Economic Area or the
countries/territories, the Swiss Confederation, the Principality of Liechtenstein, the Republic of San
Marino, the Principality of Monaco, the Principality of Andorra, Curacao and Sint Maarten. If the
withholding tax on a disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes has been calculated
on the basis of 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than from the actual gain), a German tax resident
individual holder may also apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs; however,
in case the actual gain is higher than 30% of the disposal proceeds a German tax resident individual
holder is obliged to apply for an assessment on the basis of its actual acquisition costs.

In computing any German withholding tax, the Disbursing Agent may generally deduct from the basis
of the withholding tax negative investment income realized by the individual holder of the Notes via
the Disbursing Agent (for example, losses from the sale of other capital investments (Kapitalvermögen)
with the exception of shares). The Disbursing Agent may also deduct Accrued Interest on the Notes or
other capital investments paid separately upon the acquisition of the respective security via the
Disbursing Agent. In addition, subject to certain requirements and restrictions, the Disbursing Agent
may credit foreign withholding taxes levied on investment income in a given year regarding capital
investments held by the individual holder in the custodial account with the Disbursing Agent.

Upon the individual holder filing an exemption certificate (Freistellungsauftrag) with the Disbursing
Agent, the Disbursing Agent will take a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801
(€1,602 for married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz
_über die Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly) into account when computing the amount of_
tax to be withheld from the gross payment to be made by the Disbursing Agent. No withholding tax
will be deducted if the holder of the Notes has submitted to the Disbursing Agent a certificate of nonassessment (Nichtveranlagungsbescheinigung) issued by the competent tax authorities.

In certain exceptional cases and subject to certain requirements German withholding tax may not apply
or may apply only at a reduced rate to interest payments and/or gains from the disposal, redemption,
repayment or assignment of Notes.

In case no withholding tax applies, the holder of the Notes will in general have to declare the investment
income from the Notes in its annual tax return.

Non-residents of Germany are, in general but subject to exceptions, not subject to German withholding
tax on investment income and the solidarity surcharge thereon. However, where the interest or capital
gain is subject to German taxation (as outlined below under “—Taxation of Current Income and Capital
_Gains—Non-Tax Residents”) and the Notes are held in a custodial account with a Disbursing Agent,_

##### 299


-----

withholding tax may be levied under certain circumstances. The withholding tax may be refunded based
on an assessment to tax or under an applicable tax treaty (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen).

Furthermore, payments made to a holder resident in a so-called “non-cooperative jurisdiction” (nicht
_kooperatives Steuerhoheitsgebiet) may be subject to a tax deduction by the Issuer in Germany at a rate_
of 15% (plus solidarity surcharge, i.e. in total 15.825%) of the gross payment pursuant to the German
Law to defend tax evasion and unfair tax competition (Gesetz zur Abwehr von Steuervermeidung und
_unfairem Steuerwettbewerb und zur Änderung weiterer Gesetze – “SteueroasenAbwG”) which was_
passed by the Bundesrat on June 25, 2021 (see BR-Drs. 509/21(B) and BGBl. I p. 2056). The exact
scope of this new law, in particular the application to third party financings, is, however, unclear.

**_Taxation of Current Income and Capital Gains_**

_Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Tax Residents” refers to persons who are tax residents of Germany (meaning,
persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, or place of effective management and control
is located in Germany).

Income derived from capital investments under the Notes held by an individual holder who is tax
resident in Germany is in general (subject to certain exceptions) subject to German income tax at a flattax rate of 25% (Abgeltungsteuer) (plus solidarity surcharge and church tax, if applicable, thereon) if
the Notes are held as private investment (Privatvermögen). Individual holders who are tax resident in
Germany are entitled to a maximum annual allowance (Sparer-Pauschbetrag) of €801 (€1,602 for
married couples and for partners in accordance with the registered partnership law (Gesetz über die
_Eingetragene Lebenspartnerschaft) filing jointly), whereby actually incurred higher expenses directly_
attributable to a capital investment are not deductible.

The personal income tax liability of an individual holder who is tax resident in Germany on income
from capital investments under the Notes will, in principle, be satisfied by the tax withheld (as described
under “—Withholding Tax” above). To the extent that withholding tax has not been levied, such as in
the case of Notes kept in custody abroad or if no Disbursing Agent being involved in the payment
process or if the withholding tax on disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment has been calculated
from 30% of the disposal proceeds (rather than the actual gain), the individual holder must include its
interest income and capital gains derived from the Notes in its annual tax return and will then also be
taxed at a rate of 25% (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax thereon). Further, an
individual holder may apply for a taxation of all investment income of a given year at its lower
individual tax rate based upon an assessment to tax with any amounts over-withheld being refunded. In
each case, the deduction of expenses (other than transaction costs) on an itemized basis is not permitted.
Losses incurred with respect to the Notes may only be offset with investment income of the individual
holder realized in the same or following assessment periods, subject to possible further restrictions.

Losses arising from a bad debt loss (Forderungsausfall), a waiver of a receivable (Forderungsverzicht)
or a transfer of an impaired receivable to a third party or from any other default can only be offset
against other income from capital investments and only up to an amount of €20,000 per year. Respective
losses exceeding the amount of €20.000 can be carried forward and might be usable in future tax periods
(together with current capital investment losses of each such tax period) up to an amount of €20.000
per year.

Where Notes form part of a trade or business of an individual or corporate holder or the income from
the Notes qualifies as income from the letting and leasing of property, the withholding tax, if any, will
not satisfy the personal or corporate income tax liability. Rather, the income is subject to individual or
corporate income tax (plus solidarity surcharge and, where applicable, church tax). In these cases, the
respective holder of the Notes has to include interest (including Accrued Interest) and capital gains
derived from the Notes as income and related (business) expenses in the annual tax return and the

##### 300


-----

balance will be taxed at the holder’s applicable tax rate. Withholding tax levied, if any, will be credited
as advance payment against the personal or corporate income tax liability of the holder or, to the extent
exceeding this personal or corporate income tax liability, be refunded. Where Notes form part of a
German trade or business the current income and gains from the disposal, redemption, repayment or
assignment of the Notes may also be subject to German trade tax (Gewerbesteuer). The trade tax
liability depends on the municipal trade tax factor (Gewerbesteuerhebesatz). If the holder is an
individual or an individual partner of a partnership, the trade tax may generally be completely or partly
credited against the personal income tax pursuant to a lump sum tax credit method.

_Non-Tax Residents_

This subsection “—Non-Tax Residents” refers to persons who are not tax residents of Germany
(meaning, persons whose residence, habitual abode, statutory seat, and place of effective management
and control is not located in Germany).

Interest and capital gains (which include Accrued Interest and currency gains and losses, if any) from
the disposal, redemption, repayment or assignment of the Notes received by holders who are not taxresident in Germany are generally not subject to German taxation, unless (i) the Notes form part of the
business property of a permanent establishment, including a permanent representative, or a fixed base
maintained in Germany by the holder or (ii) the income otherwise constitutes German source income
(such as income from the letting and leasing of certain German-situs real estate or income from capital
investments directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (or other assets that are from a
German civil law perspective treated as real estate), unless the Notes qualify as global certificate
(Sammelurkunde) within the meaning of Section 9a of the German Custody Act (Depotgesetz) or as
fungible notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). In cases (i) and (ii) a tax
regime similar to that explained above under “—Tax Residents” applies. Furthermore, the holders who
are not tax resident in Germany may become subject to German withholding tax in case they receive
the proceeds by way of an over-the-counter payment by a Disbursing Agent and the Notes are not held
in custody with the same Disbursing Agent. Subject to certain requirements a holder who is not taxresident in Germany may benefit from tax reductions or tax exemptions provided by an applicable
double taxation treaty on income (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen auf dem Gebiet der Steuern vom
_Einkommen) between Germany and the holder’s jurisdiction of tax residency._

**_Partial Abolishment of Solidarity Surcharge_**

The solidarity surcharge has been partially abolished as of the assessment period 2021 for certain
individuals. The solidarity surcharge, however, continues to apply for capital investments and, thus, on
withholding taxes levied. In case the individual income tax burden for an individual holder is lower
than 25% the holder can apply for his/her capital investment income being assessed at his/her individual
tariff-based income tax rate in which case solidarity surcharge would be refunded.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

A gratuitous transfer of Notes by reason of death or as a gift will be subject to German inheritance or
gift tax if the decedent or donor or the heir, donee or other beneficiary is at the time of the transfer a
resident or deemed to be a resident of Germany. If neither the holder nor the recipient is a resident or
deemed to be a resident of Germany at the time of the transfer, no German inheritance or gift taxes will
be levied unless (i) the Notes are attributable to a German trade or business for which a permanent
establishment is maintained or a permanent representative has been appointed in Germany or (ii) the
obligations under the Notes are directly or indirectly secured by German-situs real estate (or other assets
that are from a German civil law perspective treated as real estate) (unless the Notes qualify as fungible
notes representing the same issue (Teilschuldverschreibungen)). Exceptions from this rule may apply
to certain German citizens who previously maintained a residence in Germany or who (including their
German relatives belonging to their household) are in an employment relationship with a domestic legal
entity under public law and receive remuneration for this from a domestic public fund. Subject to certain
requirements, German tax provisions may be restricted by an applicable double taxation treaty on

##### 301


-----

inheritances and gifts (Doppelbesteuerungsabkommen auf dem Gebiet der Erbschaft- und
_Schenkungsteuer) between Germany and the holder’s jurisdiction of tax residency._

**_Other Taxes_**

No stamp, issue or registration taxes or such duties will be payable in Germany in connection with the
issuance, delivery or execution of the Notes (for the avoidance of doubt, except for any notarial fees).
Currently, net assets tax (Vermögensteuer) is not levied in Germany.

**_The Proposed Financial Transactions Tax_**

The EU Commission and certain EU member states (including Germany) have intended to introduce a
financial transaction tax (presumably on secondary market transactions involving at least one financial
intermediary). The considerations have not yet been implemented and a date of introduction remains
unclear, if any. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in
relation to the financial transaction tax.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
U.S. federal income tax effects. The discussion is limited to considerations relevant to a U.S. Holder
(as defined below) and does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws.

This discussion is based upon the federal income tax laws of the United States, including the U.S.
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder, and
judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and each of
which are subject to differing interpretations and change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect
which could significantly affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described below. No rulings
from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to
the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a different
position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes than
those discussed herein or that any such position would not be sustained in the event of litigation. A
different treatment than that assumed below could adversely affect the amount, timing and character of
income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in the Notes.

This discussion is general in nature and does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations that may be relevant to a U.S. Holder in light of such U.S. Holder’s particular
circumstances or status, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax,
FATCA (generally, Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, the Treasury regulations and any
administrative guidance issued thereunder, and any laws relating to an intergovernmental agreement
entered into in connection therewith), the alternative minimum tax, or the base erosion and anti-abuse
tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as banks, or certain other financial institutions, persons
who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States and other U.S.
expatriates, insurance companies, retirement plans, individual retirement and other tax-deferred
accounts, brokers or dealers in securities or currencies, traders that elect to mark their securities to
market, U.S. Holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax exempt entities, regulated
investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships, S corporations, or other pass through
entities and investors in such entities, entities covered by the U.S. anti-inversion rules, corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,”
“hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, persons that purchase or sell the
Notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, any person acquiring the Notes in connection with the
performance of services, and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of gross income
with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this
discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (meaning,

##### 302


-----

the first price at which a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold to investors for
cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity
of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and Notes held as capital assets (generally, property
held for investment) within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation
created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia,
(iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or
(iv) a trust if it is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if the trust has a valid
election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in
the Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal
income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

The discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations set forth below is for general
information purposes only. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors
concerning the tax consequences of holding the Notes in light of their particular circumstances,
including the application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the
application of other federal, state, local or other non-U.S. tax laws.

**_Effect of Certain Contingencies_**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to pay additional amounts if certain taxes are
withheld or deducted from payments on the Notes and/or make other payments on the Notes in excess
of stated principal and interest or in advance of their scheduled payment dates. Although the issue is
not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies do not result in the
Notes being treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under the applicable Treasury
regulations. This position will be based in part on our determination that, as of the date of the issuance
of the Notes, each such contingency is a remote or incidental contingency within the meaning of the
applicable Treasury regulations.

Our determination that the Notes are not contingent payment debt instruments is binding on a U.S.
Holder, unless the U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the IRS on its tax return for the year during which
such U.S. Holder acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, our position is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be
required to accrue interest income on its Notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and any
otherwise applicable OID, to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, some or all of any gain
recognized on the taxable disposition of the Notes, and to recognize foreign currency exchange gain or
loss with respect to such income. In the event a contingency occurs, the amount, timing and character
of a U.S. Holder’s income, gain or loss with respect to the Notes may be affected. U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the Notes being treated as contingent
payment debt instruments. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated
as contingent payment debt instruments.

**_Stated Interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the gross amount of stated interest on a Note
(including any Additional Amounts and without reduction for any foreign tax withheld) generally will

##### 303


-----

be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued in accordance with your regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

If you receive a payment of stated interest on a Note denominated in euro and you use the cash method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a “cash basis U.S. Holder”), you will be required
to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest received on the
Notes, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received regardless of whether the
payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize exchange gain or loss with respect
to the receipt of such payment, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euros so received.

If you receive a payment of stated interest on a Note denominated in euro and you use the accrual
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (an “accrual basis U.S. Holder”), you may
determine the amount of income recognized with respect to stated interest received on the Notes in
accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to include in
income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the stated interest that has accrued during such
year, determined based on the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which such
stated interest accrued or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder,
the part of the period within the taxable year. Under the second method, you may elect to translate stated
interest income at the spot rate on:

- the last day of the accrual period;

- the last day of the portion of the accrual period within the applicable taxable year if the accrual
period straddles your taxable year; or

- the date the stated interest payment is received if such date is within five business days of the
end of the accrual period.

This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without
the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisor as to the advisability of making the
above election.

Whether or not such election is made, upon receipt of a stated interest payment on a Note denominated
in euro (including, upon the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds which include amounts attributable
to accrued but unpaid stated interest previously included in income), you will recognize U.S. source
ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of
such payment (determined by translating the euros received at the spot rate on the date such payment is
received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in income with
respect to such payment. This exchange gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to stated interest
income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

If the Notes are issued at an “issue price” (as defined above) which is less than the stated principal
amount, such Notes will be considered to have been issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes unless the difference is less than a de minimis threshold (generally
equal to 1/4 of 1% of the Notes’ stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to
maturity from their issue date).

If the Notes are issued with OID, a U.S. Holder (whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) generally
will be required to include in gross income (as ordinary income) any OID as it accrues on a constant
yield to maturity basis, before the holder’s receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. Subject
to the foreign currency rules discussed below, the amount of OID, if any, includible in gross income for
a taxable year will be the sum of the daily portions of OID with respect to the Note for each day during
that taxable year on which the U.S. Holder holds the Note. Generally, the daily portion is determined

##### 304


-----

by allocating to each day in an “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual
period. The OID allocable to any accrual period generally will equal the excess, if any, of (a) the product
of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note as of the beginning of such accrual period and the Note’s “yield
to maturity” (determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly
adjusted for the length of the accrual period) over (b) the aggregate of all stated interest allocable to the
accrual period. In general, the “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of the first accrual period
is its issue price and, on any day thereafter, is the sum of the issue price and the amount of OID
previously includible in the gross income of any U.S. Holder, reduced by the amount of any payment
(other than a payment of stated interest) previously made on the Note.

Since the Floating Rate Notes bear a floating rate of stated interest, both the “yield to maturity” and the
amount of stated interest in each accrual period will be determined, solely for purposes of calculating
the accrual of OID, as though the Floating Rate Note will bear stated interest in all periods at a fixed
rate generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to stated interest payments on such Floating
Rate Note on its date of issue. To the extent the stated interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual
period exceeds (or is less than) the stated interest to be accrued or paid during the accrual period based
on such fixed rate on the date of issue, such difference will be accounted for United States federal
income tax purposes as an adjustment to stated interest and will have no effect on the computation of
OID.

OID will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into United States
dollars in the same manner as stated interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as
described above. A U.S. Holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon
the sale of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included
in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined
by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and
the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest).
Exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as
U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. For these
purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called
for under the terms of the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof),
with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as the receipt of
principal.

The rules regarding OID are complex and the rules described above may not apply in all cases. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their application.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules described below, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption
or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any amount attributable to
accrued but unpaid stated interest not previously included in income, which will be taxable as such) and
such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. Subject to the following sentence, if a U.S. Holder
receives foreign currency on such taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be
based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency received (with such U.S. dollar value based on
the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition). However, in the case of a Note that is considered
to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder and, if it so elects, an accrual
basis U.S. Holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such
amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual
basis U.S. Holders in regard to the sale or other disposition of Notes traded on an established securities
market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not elect to determine
the amount realized using the spot exchange rate on the settlement date (or any U.S. Holder disposing
of Notes if the election to use the spot exchange rate on the settlement date is unavailable) will recognize

##### 305


-----

foreign currency gain or loss equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the amount
received based on the spot exchange rates in effect on the date of the sale or other disposition and the
settlement date and any such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the amount paid for such Note by such
U.S. Holder, increased by previously accrued OID, if any. If a U.S. Holder uses foreign currency to
purchase a Note, the amount paid for the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency gain or loss, any gain or loss recognized
upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be
capital gain or loss and generally will be long-term capital gain or loss so long as the U.S. Holder has
held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Long-term capital gains of certain noncorporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for preferential tax rates. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of
the Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the “principal
amount” of such Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and not be treated as interest
income or expense. For these purposes, the “principal amount” of a Note is the U.S. Holder’s foreign
currency purchase price of the Note. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates
with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will equal the difference, if any, between
(i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note, determined at the spot rate on the date the
U.S. Holder disposes of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount of the Note,
determined at the spot rate on the date the U.S. Holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. Holder may recognize
exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest,
which will be treated as discussed above under “—Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as
applicable. However, upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note, a U.S. Holder will recognize any foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect
to principal amount and accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, OID) only to the extent of total
gain or loss recognized by such U.S. Holder on such disposition.

**_Source of Income and Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest and OID, if any, on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and generally
will be considered “passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S.
Holders under U.S. federal income tax laws. Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange,
retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note and any gain or loss attributable to
fluctuations in currency exchange rates generally will be treated as U.S. source. There are significant
complex limitations on a U.S. Holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. The rules governing the
calculation of foreign tax credits are complex and depend on a U.S. Holder’s particular circumstances.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any
withholding taxes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury regulations issued under the Code provisions meant to require the reporting to the IRS of
certain tax shelter transactions cover certain transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters,
including certain foreign currency transactions giving rise to losses in excess of a certain minimum
amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest or OID or a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign currency received in respect of a foreign currency note.
U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any,

##### 306


-----

with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable
Transaction Disclosure Statement).

Individuals and certain entities that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value
exceeding certain threshold amounts, generally are required to file an information report with respect
to such assets with their tax returns. A Note (or an account in which a Note is held) generally will
constitute a specified foreign financial asset subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Note is
held in an account at a U.S. financial institution.

U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the accrual
of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement
or redemption) of a Note paid to a U.S. Holder unless such U.S. Holder is an exempt recipient (such as
a corporation), and, when required, provides evidence of such exemption. The payor generally will be
required to impose backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%, on such payments if the U.S. Holder
fails to furnish an accurate taxpayer identification number and otherwise establish an exemption from
backup withholding or if certain other conditions apply. Backup withholding is not an additional tax
and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit
against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided that the required information is timely
furnished to the IRS.

**Payment by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of (or that are classified as) interest on the Notes, it is
possible that such payments may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief
as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other
exemption which may apply. It is not certain that such payments by the Guarantor will be eligible for
exemption from withholding.

**Austrian Stamp Duty**

Under the Austrian Stamp Duty Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 267/1957 as last amended by Federal
Law Gazette I No. 52/2021; _Gebührengesetz), stamp duty is triggered if an evidencing document_
(Urkunde; a term which has a technical meaning within the context of the Stamp Duty Act) on certain
dutiable transactions enumerated in sec 33 of the Stamp Duty Act is drawn up and a sufficient Austrian
nexus exists. Dutiable transactions include, e.g., lease agreements, sureties, assignments, mortgages.

According to the Austrian Stamp Duty Act, stamp duty on, e.g.,

(a) sureties (Bürgschaft) amounts to 1% of the guaranteed amount (a guarantee may be treated as
a surety if, for stamp duty purposes, it does not qualify as an abstract, first-demand guarantee
and the guarantor under the guarantee does not explicitly waive all claims, remedies or defenses
with respect to the underlying guaranteed transaction);

(b) assignments amounts to 0.8% of the consideration for the assignment, or, in case of an
assignment for security (Sicherungszession), 0.8% of the higher of the secured amount and the
value of the assigned receivables.

Austrian stamp duty is triggered if a document on a dutiable transaction is signed within Austria.

Under certain circumstances, a document on a dutiable transaction which is signed by all parties outside
of Austria may trigger stamp duty. In this case, stamp duty may generally be triggered if (i) the parties

##### 307


-----

to the transaction are resident for stamp duty purposes in Austria (Austrian residence, place of habitual
abode, seat, place of effective management or permanent establishment) and (ii) the transaction
concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to performance
under the transaction in Austria (section 16 para 2 no. 1 of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act).

If the signing of a document by all parties outside of Austria did not trigger Austrian stamp duty, stamp
duty may be triggered if the document (or a certified copy thereof) is brought into Austria and (i) the
transaction concerns an Austrian situated asset or a party to the transaction is entitled or obliged to
performance under the transaction in Austria, or (ii) a legally relevant action is taken in Austria based
on the transaction or official use of the document (or a certified copy thereof) is made in Austria (section
16 para 2 no. 2 of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act).

Austrian stamp duty may also be triggered by a document that refers to a dutiable transaction in a
qualified manner (so called confirming document; _rechtsbezeugende Urkunde). According to the_
Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance, a confirming document within the present context is constituted
if the parties to and the nature of the transaction referred to may be derived from the document. Such
document may (already) trigger Austrian stamp duty if signed by one of the parties. Further, stamp duty
may be triggered by a so called substitute document (Ersatzurkunde; e.g., a signed protocol on an orally
agreed transaction) on a dutiable transaction or a document that incorporates by reference a document
on a dutiable transaction.

If Austrian stamp duty is triggered, pursuant to the Stamp Duty Act generally the parties to the
transaction are jointly and severally liable for the amount of Austrian stamp duty triggered. In case of a
transaction under which only one party is obliged to performance, the party in whose interest the
document was created is liable for the stamp duty (e.g., the beneficiary in case of a surety) (section 28
para 1 of the Austrian Stamp Duty Act). In any case, the other party (as well as, if the competent tax
office is not duly notified of the dutiable transaction, the persons who would be responsible for such
notification) would be secondarily liable for the stamp duty triggered (section 30 of the Austrian Stamp
Duty Act). Agreements between the parties as to who shall bear stamp duty if triggered are not binding
on the tax authorities.

If stamp duty was triggered and not duly paid or the competent tax office was not duly notified of a
dutiable transaction, the competent tax office may, within its discretion, increase the amount of stamp
duty due by up to 100 per cent, depending on whether the taxpayer could have recognized that stamp
duty was triggered, the notification was made with slight or substantial delay, or provisions of the Stamp
Duty Act have been infringed for the first time or repeatedly (section 9 para 2 of the Austrian Stamp
Duty Act).

**Italian Registration Tax**

Registration tax may apply in case of mandatory registration in Italy of a guarantee or a security
document, in “case of use,” (caso d’uso), explicit reference (enunciazione) or in case of voluntary
registration.

For the purposes of the Italian registration tax, a “case of use” (caso d’uso) occurs when a document is:

(i) deposited with a judiciary office for administrative purposes only; or

(ii) deposited with a government agency or local authority, unless such deposit is mandatory by
law or regulation or is required in order for the relevant government agency or local authority
to comply with its own obligations.

Some Italian commentators are of the opinion that the filing of a contract with a judicial authority in
Italy or the commencement of legal proceedings in the Republic of Italy in respect to the same would
give rise to a “case of use” (caso d’uso). Anyway, both in case where a document is referred to in a
judgement rendered in the Republic of Italy between the same parties to said document and in case

##### 308


-----

where a document is enforced in the Republic of Italy either by way of a direct court judgement or to
obtain an exequatur of a judgement rendered outside the Republic of Italy, registration tax would be
payable.

For the purposes of the Italian registration tax, explicit reference (enunciazione) occurs when in a
document which is filed for registration reference is made to another document, provided that all the
parties to the document to which reference is made are also parties to the document filed for registration.
In case of “enunciazione” the registration of the first document would entail the registration of such
second document.

Upon the occurrence of mandatory registration in Italy, “case of use”,”enunciazione” or in case of
voluntary registration of a guarantee or a security document in favour of a third party, in addition to
taxes due in a fixed amount, a proportional registration tax with a 0,5% rate would apply on the relevant
taxable basis.

No proportional registration tax would apply to the extent that its provisions are deemed to be subject
to VAT law as provided by article 5 and article 40 of Presidential Decree No. 131 of 26 April 1986 and
the guarantee or security document would be subject only to a fixed registration tax of € 200.00.

##### CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTE GUARANTEES AND SECURITY INTERESTS

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which the_
_Issuer, the Guarantors and certain security providers are incorporated or organized, and a summary_
_of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Note Guarantees and the security interests_
_for the Notes and the Note Guarantees. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be_
_complete or to discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Notes and the Note Guarantees and the security interests. Prospective investors in_
_the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations._

**European Union**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Italy, Sweden, and the Netherlands, which are Member States of the
European Union.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015
on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), and starting from
June 26, 2017, which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the court which shall
have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company organized under
the laws of a Member State is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
concerned has its “centre of main interests” (cf. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The
determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The “centre of main interests” is not a static concept. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under
Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its “centre of main interests” in the
Member State in which it has its registered office (which presumption shall not apply if the registered
office has been moved to another Member State within the three month period prior to the request for
the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation states in its
second sentence that the “centre of main interests” shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and “which is ascertainable by third parties.” Recital 30
of the EU Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to the
“centre of main interests” may be rebutted: for instance, where the company’s central administration is
located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment
of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the
company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is
located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration
when determining the “centre of main interests” of a debtor can include where board meetings are held,
the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location
where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established and where they recognize as being the centre
of the company’s operations.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is and will remain located in a Member State in which it
has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and, accordingly, a court in such
jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings initiated in one Member State under the EU
Insolvency Regulation are automatically recognized in the Member States (other than Denmark),
although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If the “centre of main interests” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under
Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark)

##### 310


-----

have jurisdiction to open territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that company only if
such company has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU
Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to
mean “any place of operations where a company carries out or has carried out in the three months period
prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human
means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in
another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in
the three months period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the
assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member
State in which the debtor has its “centre of main interests” have not yet been commenced, pursuant to
Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may only
be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the company’s “centre of
main interests” is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial (secondary) insolvency
proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection
with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the
commencement of territorial (secondary) proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the
right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located.
Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.
Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State
within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3
shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely
linked with them, such as avoidance actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State (other than Denmark) pursuant to the EU
Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible
or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets
as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory
of another Member State at the time of the opening of insolvency proceedings, cf. Article 8 of the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Rights in rem include in particular without limitation thereto:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main insolvency proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States
so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner
appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because
the debtor’s centre of main interest (“COMI”) is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it
by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove
assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been

##### 311


-----

taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other Member State
(other than Denmark) where the debtor has assets.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by the
court of the main proceedings may exercise all the powers conferred on him by the law of the Member
State in which the main proceedings are located in another Member State as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been opened in such other Member State or any preservation measure to the contrary
has been taken there further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in such other Member State. It
may, in particular, subject to the preservation of third parties’ right in rem pursuant to Article 8 of the
EU Insolvency Regulation and to the preservation of the sellers’ rights based on a reservation of title
pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, remove assets of the company from that other
Member State.

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member
State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets
or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority
rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were
opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to
approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law
of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a
court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not
exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local
creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary
insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt
of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to
three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has created a treatment for groups of companies experiencing
difficulties by the commencement of group coordination proceedings and the appointment of an
insolvency practitioner in order to facilitate the effective administration of the insolvency proceedings
of the group’s members. The EU Insolvency Regulations provides

(i) for cooperation between (i) insolvency practitioners of main insolvency proceedings and of
secondary insolvency proceedings, (ii) jurisdictions and (iii) jurisdictions and insolvency
practitioners;

(ii) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the
efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part
of the same group;

(iii) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

##### 312


-----

(iv) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection
of such insolvency registers.

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “EU Restructuring
Directive”) was published on June 26, 2019.

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e. individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to
address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented
and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the EU Restructuring Directive provides
for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against
debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be
grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum,
creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may
be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the
amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of
affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring
plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one
or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted
the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure
the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the
adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall
protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim
financing granted in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17,
2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition
period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring
Directive.

In the event that the Issuer, the Guarantors and/or certain security providers experience financial
difficulties, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency
or similar proceedings would be commenced, or to predict the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable
insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer and some of the
Guarantors. The insolvency, administration and other laws of the jurisdictions in which the respective
companies are organized or operate may be materially different from or conflict with each other and
there is no assurance as to how the insolvency laws of the potentially involved jurisdictions will be
applied in relation to one another.

**Germany**

The Issuer and certain Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, have their registered
offices in Germany and substantially all of their assets are located in Germany. In the event of an
insolvency of the Issuer or a Guarantor organized under the laws of Germany and/or having its “centre
of main interests” in Germany (each a “German Guarantor” and collectively, the “German Guarantors”)
at the time the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed,
any main insolvency proceedings would most likely be initiated in Germany. Such proceedings would
then be governed by German law. Under certain circumstances, secondary or territorial insolvency
proceedings over certain assets of the Issuer and/or a German Guarantor may be opened in other
jurisdictions, in particular if such assets are located in another Member State of the European Union
(other than Denmark). With respect to cross-border group insolvencies, Art 56 et seq. Recast Insolvency
Regulation introduced requirements facilitating communication and cooperation between the
administrators and courts involved. In addition, a coordination procedure may be initiated, which
involves the appointment of a coordinator and the adoption of a cross-border coordination plan.
Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency
practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. Prior to taking the decision to participate
or not to participate in the coordination, an insolvency practitioner shall obtain any approval, which
may be required under the law of the state of the opening of proceedings for which it has been appointed.
See “—European Union.”

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) or the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG), may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors than the insolvency laws of the United States or another
jurisdiction with which you may be familiar, including aspects as the priority of creditors’ claims, the
ability to obtain post-petition interest as well as, in certain circumstances, priority recovery for secured
creditors and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and thus may limit your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws.

**_Insolvency_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the German Insolvency
Code (Insolvenzordnung):

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency
court ex officio, but require that the debtor and/or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings (Insolvenzerföffnungsantrag). Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor
or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event of its
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit), meaning generally that the debtor is unable to pay 10% or more of its
debts as and when they fall due for a period longer than three weeks, unless it is virtually certain that
the debtor can close the liquidity gab shortly thereafter (demnächst) and it can be deemed acceptable to
the creditors to continue to wait for payments owed by such debtor. According to the relevant provision
of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities
exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values), unless a continuation of the debtor’s
business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend wahrscheinlich) based on a 12
months’ forecast horizon (positive Fortführungsprognose). If a limited liability company (Gesellschaft
_mit beschränkter Haftung), a public limited liability company (Aktiengesellschaft), a European law_
stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea) or any other company not having an
individual as personally liable shareholder or partner finds itself in a situation of illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung), each managing director or member
of the board of management of such company and, in certain circumstances, its shareholders or members
of the supervisory board, are obligated to file for insolvency without undue delay but not later than three
weeks after such illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or six weeks after such over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) occurred or (as the case may be) was established. Noncompliance with these
obligations exposes the person obliged to file for insolvency to both severe damage claims as well as

##### 314


-----

sanctions under criminal law. In addition, only the debtor, but not the creditors, can file for the opening
of insolvency proceedings or for restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) in the event of imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit), which is the case if_
the company will presumably be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due at some point in time
within a prognosis period of usually 24 months, whereas imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) does not give rise to an obligation for the management of the debtor to file for_
insolvency proceedings.

The Act to Temporarily Suspend the Obligation to File for Insolvency and to Limit Directors’ Liability
in the Case of Insolvency Caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which was adopted on March 27, 2020
and entered into force with retroactive effect as of March 1, 2020 (as amended from time to time, the
“COVInsAG”), provided, inter alia, for a suspension of the obligation to file for insolvency due to overindebtedness until April 30, 2021. However, this did not apply to companies whose over-indebtedness
was not resulting from the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. The suspension—as in force
from February 1, 2021— applies to debtors who, in the period from November 1, 2020 to February 28,
2021, have applied for financial assistance under state assistance programs to mitigate the consequences
of the COVID-19 pandemic, unless the insolvency is not caused by consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic and there is obviously no prospect of obtaining the state financial assistance or the assistance
that can be obtained is insufficient to eliminate the over-indebtedness or the debtor falls within the
group of beneficiaries of these state assistance programs, but it was not possible to submit an application
for factual or legal reasons.

A company may also file for preliminary “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (vorläufige
_Eigenverwaltung), if, in general, the company has developed a comprehensive and conclusive turn-_
around plan to be implemented by way of debtor-in-possession proceedings and the insolvency court is
not aware of any circumstances that indicate that key aspects of the filed turn-around plan are based on
incorrect assumptions. If a company faces imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and/or
is over-indebted (überschuldet), but not illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), it may also file for so called
protective shield proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), unless—from a third party perspective—there
is no reasonable chance for a successful restructuring. These requirements have to be confirmed by a
qualified person, such as a tax advisor, auditor or lawyer. Upon such filing by the debtor, the court will
appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and prohibit enforcement measures (other
than with respect to immovable assets). It may also implement other preliminary measures to protect
the debtor from creditor enforcement actions for up to three months. During the period of either the
preliminary debtor-in-possession proceedings (vorläufige Eigenverwaltung) or the protective shield
proceedings (Schutzschirmverfahren), the debtor shall prepare an insolvency plan which ideally shall
be implemented in main “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) after insolvency
proceedings have been opened.

The insolvency proceedings are controlled by the competent insolvency court, which generally monitors
the due performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court
may take preliminary measures to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary insolvency
proceedings (vorläufiges Insolvenzverfahren). In particular, the insolvency court may prohibit or
suspend any measures taken to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these
preliminary insolvency proceedings (other than with respect to immoveable assets) or, to the extent
required to ensure the continuation of the debtor’s business, prohibit the enforcement of any collateral
granted over claims, rights or other movable assets of debtor. If the enforcement of collateral is
prohibited by the insolvency court, secured creditors have to be adequately compensated by the
insolvency estate.

Unless the debtor has applied for debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which event
the court will generally only appoint a preliminary custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) who will
supervise the management of the affairs by the debtor) the insolvency court will in most cases appoint
a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter). The rights and duties of the
preliminary insolvency administrator or the preliminary custodian depend on the decision of the court.

##### 315


-----

The duties of the preliminary insolvency administrator or preliminary custodian may include
safeguarding and preserving the debtor’s property and assessing whether the debtor’s net assets will be
sufficient to cover at least the costs of the (main) insolvency proceedings. Depending on the decision
of the court, even the right to manage the business and dispose of the assets of the debtor may pass to
the preliminary insolvency administrator, whilst in “debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor’s
management generally retains the right to manage business. However, the court may also order that
certain disposals of the debtor may require the preliminary custodian’s consent also in “debtor-inpossession” proceedings. The insolvency court can also order a stay of all enforcement measures by
unsecured creditors against the debtor.

During preliminary insolvency proceedings, the insolvency court has to appoint a “preliminary
creditors’ committee” (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) if the debtor satisfies at least two of the
following three requirements:

(i) a balance sheet total of at least €6,000,000 (after deducting an equity shortfall if the debtor is
over indebted according to the balance sheet);

(ii) revenue of at least €12,000,000 in the twelve months prior to the last day of the financial year
preceding the filing; and/or

(iii) fifty or more employees on an annualized average basis (including, inter alios, part time
employees).

The preliminary creditors’ committee will be able to participate in certain important decisions made in
the preliminary insolvency proceedings. It will have, for example, the power to influence the following:
the selection of a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter) / preliminary
custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter) and an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) / custodian
(Sachwalter) and court orders for (preliminary) “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Anordnung der
_(vorläufigen) Eigenverwaltung)._

The court opens (main) insolvency proceedings (Eröffnung des Insolvenzverfahrens) if certain formal
requirements are met, including if (i) the debtor is in a situation of imminent illiquidity (if the petition
has been filed by the debtor), illiquidity and/or over-indebtedness and (ii) if there are sufficient assets
to cover at least the cost of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not expected to
be sufficient to cover such costs, the insolvency court will only open (main) insolvency proceedings if
third parties (e.g., creditors), advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings will usually be refused for insufficiency of assets
(Abweisung mangels Masse).

Unless the court has granted “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) (in which case the
court will only appoint a custodian (Sachwalter) who will supervise the management of the affairs by
the debtor), upon opening of the insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) who has full administrative and disposal authority over the debtor’s
assets, whereas the debtor is no longer entitled to dispose of its assets. The insolvency creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) will only be entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency
administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’ assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such
change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by heads and amount of insolvency claims)
has voted in favor of the proposed individual to become insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed
individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e., sufficiently qualified, business experienced and impartial.
Individual creditors or the debtor can request the insolvency court to remove the insolvency
administrator only on the grounds of a lack of impartiality and only within six months from the
appointment.

The insolvency administrator (or in the case of “debtor in possession proceedings,” the debtor) may
raise new financial indebtedness and incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s operations. The
satisfaction of these liabilities as preferential debts of the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) will be

##### 316


-----

preferred to any unsecured insolvency liability created by the debtor, including, e.g., the Note
Guarantees. Residual claims of a secured insolvency creditors remaining after realization of the
respective collateral (if any) also qualify as unsecured insolvency claim in this regard. However, in
“debtor-in-possession” proceedings, the debtor shall only incur estate liabilities in the ordinary course
of business without the custodian’s (Sachwalter) consent.

Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be
effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory contracts become
unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for performance.

The insolvency administrator (or custodian in case of “debtor-in-possession proceedings”) may also
challenge transactions that are deemed detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected
prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings (See “—Hardening Periods and Fraudulent
_Transfer”)._

For the holders of the Notes, the consequences of the opening of German insolvency proceedings
against the Issuer or any German Guarantor would include, among possible voidance actions and other
things, the following:

(i) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), the right to
administer and dispose of the Issuer’s or German Guarantor’s assets will generally pass to the
insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter);

(ii) unless the court orders “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung), disposals
effected by the Issuer’s or German Guarantor’s management after the opening of insolvency
proceedings are null and void by operation of law;

(iii) if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter,
a creditor in the insolvency proceedings acquires through execution (e.g., attachment) a security
interest in part of the relevant insolvency debtor’s property that would normally form part of
the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the opening
of the insolvency proceedings;

(iv) claims against the relevant debtor may generally only be pursued in accordance with the rules
set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

(v) any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderung), i.e. the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute a part of the insolvency estate, does not participate in the insolvency
proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of ordinary court
proceedings against the insolvency administrator.

Certain of these consequences could be achieved by decision of the insolvency court following the
insolvency petition and prior to the opening of (main) insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, termination rights, automatic termination events or “escape clauses”
entitling one party to terminate an agreement or resulting in an automatic termination of an agreement
upon the opening of insolvency proceedings in respect of the other party, the filing for insolvency or
the occurrence of reasons justifying the opening of insolvency or restructuring proceedings
(insolvenzbezogene Kündigungsrechte oder Lösungsklauseln) may be invalid. Such clause would
frustrate the right of the insolvency administrator to choose whether or not to perform the contract
(Wahlrecht des Insolvenzverwalters) unless such clause only reflects termination rights applicable
under statutory law. This may also relate to agreements that are not governed by German law.

All other creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to segregate an asset from
the insolvency estate (Aussonderungsrecht) or are preferred creditors (Massegläubiger) as opposed to
a preferential right (Absonderungsrecht)), who wish to assert claims against the debtor need to

##### 317


-----

participate in the insolvency proceedings and have to file their claims against the debtor and the rights
they claim in the assets of the debtor with the insolvency administrator. With the exception of certain
secured creditors, an individual enforcement action brought against the debtor by any of its creditors is
subject to an automatic stay once the insolvency proceedings have been opened (and, if so ordered by
a court, also between the time when an insolvency petition is filed and the time when insolvency
proceedings commence). German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may
generally no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can
instead only enforce them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). Accordingly, also unsecured creditors may file their claims in the insolvency
proceedings and will in the end be paid on a pro rata basis from the insolvency estate (to the extent
sufficient assets are available). Secured creditors are generally not entitled to enforce their security
interests after insolvency proceedings have been commenced to the extent the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) authorizes the insolvency administrator to dispose of the relevant collateral but have
only certain preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) in the insolvency proceedings. In this case,
secured creditors will only have a right to claim the recoveries (minus costs and fees) from such
realization. Whether or not, after the initiation of insolvency proceedings, a secured creditor remains
entitled to enforce security granted to it by the relevant debtor depends on the type of security: The
insolvency administrator generally has the sole right (i) to realize any movable assets within its
possession that are subject to preferential rights (Absonderungsrechte) (e.g., pledges over movable
assets and rights (Mobiliarpfandrechte), transfer by way of security (Sicherungsübereignung)) and (ii)
to collect any claims that are subject to security assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen).
According to some opinions in legal literature, it is uncertain whether the secured creditors are entitled
to initiate the enforcement process in respect of pledged uncertificated shares on their own or, insofar
as the pledged assets are part of any insolvency estate, whether the insolvency administrator has
standing to realize the pledges on behalf of and for the benefit of the secured creditors. However, there
is no authoritative case law on this question. That having been said, the German Federal Court of Justice
(Bundesgerichtshof) views the insolvency administrator competent to realize pledged shares in a
corporation that have been certificated (verbrieft) and are hold in a custodian account (Depot) in
Germany in case the shares represent more than 20% in the issued share capital of the pledged company.
It therefore appears likely that in this particular case, secured creditors would not be held competent to
realize the respective share pledges.

Even if the law vests the right of disposal regarding the relevant collateral in the insolvency
administrator, the secured creditor retains the right of preferred satisfaction with regard to the disposal
proceeds (Ersatzabsonderungsrecht). Consequently, the enforcement proceeds minus certain
contributory charges of 9% (or as agreed upon individually, but in any case at least 4%) for (i) assessing
the value of the secured assets and (ii) realizing the secured assets are paid to the creditor holding a
security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. Remaining
amounts (“excess proceeds”) will be allocated to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) (being the
remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor) and would, after deduction of the costs of the insolvency
proceedings (e.g., fees for and expenses of the preliminary insolvency administrator, the insolvency
administrator and the insolvency court as well as the members of the (preliminary) creditors’
committee) and after satisfaction of certain preferential liabilities be distributed among the nonpreferential unsecured creditors, including the holders of the Notes (to the extent not satisfied after
enforcement of the Collateral securing the Notes). If the Issuer or a German Guarantor or a subsidiary
thereof subject to German insolvency proceedings grants security over its assets to creditors other than
the holders of the Notes, such security may result in a preferred satisfaction of creditors secured by such
security (however, the preferential treatment would be limited to the proceeds obtained through the
disposal of the relevant collateral). The excess proceeds resulting from such collateral may not be
sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes by the Issuer or the German Guarantors after such
secured creditors have been satisfied.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the
insolvency administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency
administrator, however, must compensate the creditor in accordance with specific rules. In addition, it

##### 318


-----

may take several years before proceeds from the liquidation of the insolvency estate, if any, are
distributed to unsecured creditors. A different distribution of enforcement proceeds can be proposed in
an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan) that can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
or, in “debtor-in-possession proceedings,” by the custodian (upon instruction of the preliminary
creditors’ committee or the creditors’ meeting) and which requires, in principle, the consent of the
debtor as well as the consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules. The
insolvency court may order the deemed approval of one or more opposing creditor groups under certain
conditions (cram down). The insolvency plan may derogate from the provisions of the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). In particular, it may contain provisions regarding the discharge
of secured and unsecured creditors, the disposal of the insolvency estate as well as procedure. It may
also create, modify, transfer or terminate rights in rem such as property rights or security interests. If
the debtor is a corporate entity, the shares or, as the case may be, the partnership interests in the debtor
can also be included in the insolvency plan, including an issuance of shares or partnership interests to
third parties or to creditors based on a debt-to-equity swap. With regard to any Change of Control
triggered by measures taken in respect of the Issuer for the purpose of a debt/equity-swap as part of an
insolvency plan proceeding (Insolvenzplanverfahren) under German law, the Change of Control
provision could be deemed void.

An insolvency plan could under certain circumstances provide for provisions, inter alia, regarding the
Notes or the Note Guarantees or the Collateral which are less favorable to the holders of the Notes than
the provisions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), such as the release of the Collateral
or the release of obligations under the Notes or the Note Guarantees. Under certain conditions, such
provisions could be adopted against the votes of the affected holders of the Notes. However, it will not
be possible to force a creditor into a debt-to-equity conversion if it does not consent to such debt-forequity swap under the proposed insolvency plan.

An insolvency plan can further provide for the release or other impairment of guarantees or other
security interests provided by debtor affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten), without such debtor
affiliates being required to become subject of the debtor’s or separate insolvency proceedings, provided
that the relevant debtor affiliate consents to the impairment. Creditors affected by such impairment are
entitled to receive adequate compensation. This means that the claims under the Note Guarantees can
get impaired if the Issuer would enter into German insolvency proceedings, regardless of whether or
not the relevant German Guarantor is itself subject of insolvency proceedings.

Under German insolvency law, there is no consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of
companies in the event of insolvency. In the case of a group of companies, each entity, from an
insolvency law point of view, has to be dealt with separately. As a consequence, there is, in particular,
no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, but rather claims of and vis-à-vis each
entity have to be dealt with separately. However, the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) has
provisions to facilitate the coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group
companies. Whereas these provisions do not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings
of the insolvent group companies, or a consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies
or pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group, they stipulate four key measures in order
to facilitate an efficient administration of insolvencies in a group: (i) a single court may assume
jurisdiction for other group company insolvency proceedings (Gruppengerichtsstand); (ii) a single
person may be appointed as insolvency administrator for all relevant group companies; (iii) certain
coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency administrators and creditors’
committees, and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordinator” (Verfahrenskoordinator) with the
ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan) for approval by the coordination court
(Koordinationsgericht).

As a general principle, the claims arising from the Notes or a Note Guarantee may be enforced against
the Issuer or a German Guarantor outside of the insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer or
the relevant German Guarantor, as applicable. Any insolvency proceedings over the assets of the Issuer

##### 319


-----

would, however, be a rather strong indication that the overall financial situation of the entire group of
affiliated companies has significantly deteriorated, which may cause a German Guarantor to
subsequently file for insolvency.

German insolvency law provides for certain creditors and their claims to be subordinated by law
(including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the relevant debtor
for the return of repayment of shareholder loans or comparable actions, but except for government
developments banks and its affiliates). The restrictive nature of the covenants and undertakings in the
Indentures may result in the holders of the Notes and/or the applicable Trustee being considered in a
“shareholder like” position (gesellschafterähnliche Stellung). In that event, in an insolvency proceeding
over the assets of the Issuer or a German Guarantor, the claims arising from the Notes or a Note
Guarantee would be treated as a subordinated insolvency claim (nachrangige Insolvenzforderungen).
Subordinated insolvency claims are not eligible to participate in the insolvency proceedings over the
assets of the Issuer or a German Guarantor unless the insolvency court handling the case has granted
special permission allowing these subordinated insolvency claims to be filed which is not granted in the
vast majority of insolvency cases governed by German law. Claims of a person who becomes a creditor
of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings generally rank senior to claims
of regular, unsecured creditors. Powers of attorney granted by the relevant debtor and certain other legal
relationships cease to be effective upon the opening of insolvency proceedings. Certain executory
contracts become unenforceable at such time unless and until the insolvency administrator opts for
performance.

**_Hardening Periods and Fraudulent Transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung), an insolvency administrator or, in the event
that “debtor-in-possession” proceedings (Eigenverwaltung) have been granted, the custodian
(Sachwalter) may also challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and were effected prior to the commencement of insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidance periods. The administrator’s or the custodian’s right to
challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to transactions during a ten-year
period prior to the filing of the petition for opening of insolvency proceedings.

In the event of insolvency proceedings based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the
payment of any amounts to the holders of Notes as well as the granting of collateral for or providing
credit support for the benefit of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency
administrator or, as the case may be, a custodian under the rules of avoidance as set forth in the German
Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If the validity or enforceability of the Notes, the respective Note
Guarantees or any Collateral in favor of the Notes is challenged successfully, the holder of the Notes
may not be able to recover any amounts under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the relevant Collateral.
If payments have already been made under the Notes, the Note Guarantee or Collateral, any amounts
received from a transaction that had been challenged would have to be repaid to the insolvency estate.
In this case, holders of the Notes would only have a general unsecured claim under the Notes and the
Note Guarantees without preference in insolvency proceedings.

In particular, a legal act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which terms also
include the granting of security or the repayment of debt) may be avoided in the following cases:

(i) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (a)
during the last three months prior to the filing of a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings, if the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the
creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of circumstances that imperatively suggest that the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig)) at such time, or (b) after the filing of the petition for the opening
of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
or the filing of such petition (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity

##### 320


-----

(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s insolvency_
or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(ii) any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was
not entitled or which was granted or obtained in a form in which or at a time at which such
creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if (a) such act was taken during the last
month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after such
filing, (b) such act was taken during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition
and the debtor was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at such time or (c) such act was taken during the
second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental
to the other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that imperatively suggest
such detrimental effect); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) as
described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the detrimental nature of such
transaction for other creditors;

(iii) any transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which
the debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against
a debtor is obtained or becomes enforceable, provided it was entered into (a) during the three
months prior to the filing of the petition of the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor
was illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) at the time of such transaction and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at such time or (b) after the filing of
the petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such
transaction knew of either the debtor’s illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or such filing at the
time of the transaction (or of circumstances imperatively suggesting such illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or filing); whereby in each case an “affiliated party” (nahestehende
_Person) as described below shall be presumed to have been aware of the debtor’s illiquidity_
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or of the filing to open insolvency proceedings;

(iv) any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration (e.g., whereby a debtor grants security
(including a guarantee) for a third-party debt, which might be regarded as having been granted
gratuitously (unentgeltlich)), if it was effected in the four years prior to the filing of the petition
for the commencement of insolvency proceedings;

(v) any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing with the intent to prejudice the
insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) if the other party knew of such
intention at the time of such act with such knowledge being presumed if the beneficiary knew
that the debtor’s illiquidity was at least imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the
transaction disadvantaged the other creditors. For granting an insolvency creditor or enabling
an insolvency creditor to obtain security or satisfaction to which such creditor was entitled,
such knowledge is (solely) presumed if such creditor knew that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) (as opposed to the knowledge of imminent illiquidity (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in regular cases) and that the transaction disadvantaged the other_
creditors. Apart from that, such acts granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency
creditor, to obtain security (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) (whether or not it was
granted or obtained in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was entitled to
such security or satisfaction), may only be avoided if they were effected in the four years prior
to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or at a time after the filing.
There is a rebuttable presumption that, if the debtor reached a payment agreement
(Zahlungsvereinbarung) with the creditor or the creditor granted any other form of deferred
payment (Zahlungserleichterungen) to the debtor, he had no knowledge of the debtor’s
illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) at the time of the transaction;

##### 321


-----

(vi) any non-gratuitous contract (entgeltlicher Vertrag) concluded between the debtor and an
“affiliated party” (nahestehende Person), as described below, which directly operates to the
detriment of the creditors can be challenged unless such contract was concluded earlier than
two years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the
other party had no knowledge of the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the
time the contract was concluded;

(vii) any act that grants security (including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung)
for a claim under a shareholder loan granted to the debtor or an equivalent claim if (a) in the
case of the granting of security, the act took place during the ten years prior to the filing of the
petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition, or
(b) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such petition. This does
not apply (a) to shareholders that own 10% or less of the shares or interest and are not engaged
in management and (b) until the sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige Sanierung) of the debtor
in case a creditor for the first time acquires shares during over indebtedness, illiquidity or
imminent illiquidity with the intension to restructure the debtor; and

(viii) any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction to a third party for a loan claim or an equivalent
claim if (a) the transaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter and (b) a shareholder of the debtor had granted
security for such loan or was liable as a guarantor or surety provider (Garant oder Bürge) for
such loan (in which case the shareholder has to compensate the debtor for the amounts paid
(subject to further conditions)).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from
which the conclusion must be drawn that, e.g., the debtor (e.g., a German Guarantor) was unable to pay
its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings had been
filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice, the insolvency creditors, as the case
may be. Knowledge of pending restructuring proceedings (see “—Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) per se does not suffice for a creditor to be deemed to have such “knowledge.” A person_
is further deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to prejudice the insolvency creditors if it
knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. If
the relevant act granted an insolvency creditor, or enabled an insolvency creditor to obtain, security
(including a guarantee) (Sicherung) or satisfaction (Befriedigung) in a form in which and at a time at
which such creditor was entitled to such security or satisfaction (kongruente Deckungshandlung), the
words “imminent illiquidity” (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) in the preceding sentence have to be
replaced by “actual illiquidity” (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit). With respect to an “affiliated party”
(nahestehende Person) as described below there is a general statutory presumption that such party had
“knowledge” as indicated above.

In relation to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” (nahestehende Person) includes, subject to
certain limitations, members of the management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders
owning more than 25% of the debtor’s share capital, persons or companies holding comparable
positions that give them access to information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other
persons who are spouses, relatives or members of the household of any of the foregoing persons.

The granting of a security concurrently with the incurrence of debt funded as new money may be
qualified as a “cash transaction” and may as such be privileged. Meaning, under certain circumstances
it may not be subject to avoidance rights under the German Insolvency Code (Bargeschäftsprivileg).
According to recent case law of the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), however,
this privilege does not apply to claims as described under (vii) above.

Any kind of newly granted third-party financing (i.e., not only traditional cash loans but also
commercial credits and other forms of financing) and respective collateral as well as shareholder loans

##### 322


-----

under German insolvency law avoidance provisions, which have been granted from March 1, 2020 until
September 30, 2020 are privileged under German insolvency law due to the CovInsAG. Thus, the
repayment (including reasonable interest payments) of third-party financing and shareholder loans by
September 30, 2023 shall not be considered disadvantageous to creditors if the relevant financing was
granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the
respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing duties at the time, until December 31, 2020
or April 30, 2021). Loans granted, and security taken, by certain public institutions as part of COVID19 subsidies remain privileged even if granted or taken after that period. The general privilege also
includes the provision of collateral in favor of third-party financing providers, but does not apply in
case of the provision of collateral in favor of a shareholder loan or receivables from economically
similar acts.

Furthermore, any transactions contemplated by a restructuring plan (see “—Preventive Restructuring
_Framework”) are not subject to avoidance actions until a sustainable restructuring (nachhaltige_
_Sanierung) of the debtor is achieved, unless the restructuring plan was based on incorrect or incomplete_
information presented by the debtor and the addressee of the avoidance action had knowledge thereof.
This privilege does not apply to shareholder loans or economically similar transactions or collateral
provided therefor.

Any amounts obtained from transactions that have been challenged would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate. In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended
existing funding to a debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable towards another creditor
if (i) such creditor was aware of the debtor’s (impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating
such debtor’s (impending) insolvency (for which knowledge of pendent restructuring proceedings (see
“—Preventive Restructuring Framework”) per se does not suffice) at the time such funding was
provided or extended or such security was granted and (ii) the other creditor suffered losses caused by
a delayed filing for insolvency based on the additional or extended existing funding. The German
Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, e.g., the creditor was to
act with the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in
violation of the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the
beneficiary of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor
of the guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further
with respect thereto. If, however, such was additional funding has been provided or existing funding
has been extended or respective collateral has been granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30,
2020 (in certain cases, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021), any such transaction is statutorily
exempted from the lender liability concept as laid out above.

**_Satisfaction of Subordinated Claims_**

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date when the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims shall be satisfied
ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given below, and according to the
proportion of their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on
the claims of the insolvency creditors from the day of the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii)
costs incurred by individual insolvency creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines,
regulatory fines, coercive fines and administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences
of a criminal or administrative offence binding the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims to the debtor’s
gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for restitution of a shareholder loan
(Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions corresponding in economic terms
to such a loan. However, the statutory subordination of shareholder loans and receivables from
economically similar acts is suspended in insolvency proceedings applied for up until September 30,
2023 for newly granted shareholder loans granted between March 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020 (in
certain cases, if the debtor fulfilled the respective requirements for a further suspension of the filing
duties at the time, until December 31, 2020 or April 30, 2021).

**_Preventive Restructuring Framework_**

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the proceedings under the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG).

Based on the Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019
on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to
increase the efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and
amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the “Restructuring
Directive”) the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has come into force on January
1, 2021. The Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act provides for a new pre-insolvency
procedure to restructure the liabilities of debtors, whose “centre of main interests” is located in
Germany. This may apply to the German Guarantors as well as to the Issuer.

As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) has only come into force on January 1,
2021, nearly no corresponding (court) practice exists as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and
consequently any proceedings under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) come
with uncertainty.

For the holders of the Notes, among the relevant consequences of an initiation of restructuring
proceedings by a German Guarantor or any other Guarantor having its “centre of main interests” in
Germany would be in particular the following:

- limited court review and/or supervision of the restructuring proceedings;

- any measures (such as reduction in principal and/or interest or deferrals) regulated by the
restructuring plan may be approved within a class of creditors (e.g., the holders of the Notes)
with a majority of 75% of the claims or by way of a so-called cross-class cram down by other
classes under certain presumptions;

- any collateral granted by the debtor as well as intra-group collateral may be subject to
restructuring proceedings potentially leading to a negative impact on the respective collateral;
and

- restrictions on individual enforcement actions for all or certain creditors regarding their claims,
or, if applicable, their respective collateral over moveable assets of up to eight months due to a
moratorium.

**_Restructuring Proceedings_**

Restructuring proceedings may only be initiated by the relevant debtor with a notification of the
competent restructuring court of the commencement of restructuring proceedings. A debtor is eligible
to file for restructuring proceedings if it has become imminently illiquid (drohend zahlungsunfähig).
Such imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) occurs if it is more likely than not that the
debtor will be unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due within a two years’ look-forward period.

During the restructuring proceedings, the debtor has to observe the duty of a prudent business manager,
which includes safeguarding the best interest of all of the debtor’s creditors. In particular, the debtor
has to refrain from any actions, which cannot be reconciled with or potentially frustrate the restructuring
goal (Restrukturierungsziel). This means that, generally, any claims, which shall be subject to the
envisaged restructuring plan, must not be settled or collateralized during the restructuring proceedings.
Pursuant to Section 44 StaRUG, contractually agreed resolution rights that entitle the debtor to terminate
a contract, to declare performance due thereunder or to exercise a right to refuse performance in this
respect upon pendency of a restructuring proceeding or upon the utilisation of instruments of the
stabilisation and restructuring framework are invalid.

##### 324


-----

During the restructuring proceedings, the duty to file for insolvency without undue delay if the debtor
becomes illiquid (zahlungsunfähig) or over-indebted (überschuldet) is generally suspended. However,
if such an insolvency event occurs, the debtor is obliged to notify the restructuring court accordingly
without undue delay. The restructuring court then abrogates the restructuring proceedings unless, in the
restructuring courts discretion, (i) the abrogation of the restructuring proceedings is, against the
backdrop of the advanced status of restructuring proceedings, evidently not in the interest of all creditors
or (ii) the illiquidity (Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness (Überschuldung) is caused by the
enforcement of any such claim that is envisaged to be subject to the restructuring plan provided the
achievement of the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) remains predominantly likely. Once
restructuring proceedings have been abrogated by the restructuring court, the debtor is again obliged to
file for insolvency under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). If (i) the envisaged
restructuring also comprises of consumer claims or claims of small or medium enterprises or respective
collateral granted for the benefit of such claims, (ii) the debtor has filed for a moratorium against all or
essentially all creditors or (iii) the envisaged restructuring plan provides for specific supervision of the
settlement of claims subject to the plan, the restructuring court has to appoint a mandatory restructuring
officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter). A mandatory restructuring officer is also to be appointed by
the restructuring court if the restructuring goal (Restrukturierungsziel) can predictably only be achieved
by a cram-down of dissenting classes (unless only claims originated by financial institutions and/or
shareholders are to be compromised).

The restructuring court may appoint as mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter)
any person with experience in restructurings and insolvencies who is suitable for the respective
individual case and who is qualified as a tax advisor, accountant, lawyer or has comparable
qualifications (an “Eligible Restructuring Officer”); the court may take suggestions by the debtor,
creditors or shareholders into account. If (i) the debtor is, based on expert opinion provided by an
Eligible Restructuring Officer, eligible for a moratorium (see “—Moratorium”), or (ii) creditors of one
class with at least 25% of the corresponding votes in such class propose a mandatory restructuring
officer, the court may only appoint a mandatory restructuring officer different from the proposed
Eligible Restructuring Officer if the proposed Eligible Restructuring Officer is evidently inadequate. If
a mandatory restructuring officer is appointed based on the proposal of the debtor or a group of
creditors, the restructuring court may appoint an additional mandatory restructuring officer in its own
discretion.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) is entitled to decide on the
procedure to be elected for the voting on the restructuring plan (see “—Voting on the restructuring
_plan”) and can be empowered by the restructuring court to (i) supervise the debtor’s board and business_
situation and (ii) receive payments to and approve payments made by the debtor. If a moratorium is
granted, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to monitor that the respective prerequisites of
such moratorium persist and, in case such prerequisites do not persist, entitled to file for a lifting of
such moratorium. Additionally, the mandatory restructuring officer is obliged to comment on the
proposed plan’s prospects to remove the debtor’s imminent illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit)
and restore the debtor’s viability.

The mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has to perform its duties
independently and the debtor is obliged to share all relevant information with the mandatory
restructuring officer.

The restructuring court can remove the mandatory restructuring officer from office for good cause ex
officio or, if the mandatory restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) has not acted
independently, on the debtor’s or a creditor’s petition.

Furthermore, the debtor or at least 25% of creditors in a voting class, can request the appointment of an
optional restructuring officer to facilitate the development and negotiation of a restructuring plan.
Creditors may only request such appointment if they agree to be jointly and severally liable for the costs
of the optional restructuring officer. The optional restructuring officer is only obliged to support the

##### 325


-----

stakeholders involved in the negotiations of the restructuring plan, but has no further powers. An
optional restructuring officer can also be removed from office by the restructuring court ex officio for
good cause or, if the optional restructuring officer has not acted independently, on the debtor’s or a
creditor’s petition.

Prior to a confirmation and implementation of a restructuring plan, the restructuring court may terminate
the restructuring proceedings for certain reasons, e.g. if the debtor notifies the restructuring court of the
occurrence of an insolvency event unless, in the restructuring court’s discretion (taking into account the
actual status of the relevant restructuring proceedings), the opening of formal insolvency proceedings
is obviously not in the interest of the entirety of the creditors or if the debtor files for insolvency or
insolvency proceedings are opened over the assets of the debtor based on a creditor’s filing.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Key element of the restructuring proceedings is the restructuring plan (Restrukturierungsplan), which
can comprise certain selected or all (with the exception of employees’ claims, including pensions, and
claims based on intentionally committed acts of tort) of the debtor’s liabilities, or amend the terms of
financial and other agreements to which more than the debtor and one other party are parties, including
the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

Any form of financial or operational debt may be compromised, including contingent claims and undue
claims, and relating contractual arrangements including syndicated credit facilities and intercreditor
agreements can be amended by virtue of the plan. Corresponding collateral provided by debtor affiliates
(gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten) may also be released and/or granted under a restructuring plan,
provided that affected creditors are adequately compensated. Consequently, the Notes or the Notes’
Guarantees could also be subject to a restructuring plan provided the respective debtor has its “centre
of main interests” in Germany.

Further, a restructuring plan may provide for a (partial) debt-to-equity swap or other corporate law
measures like a share-capital increase. Debt-to-equity swaps can be implemented without the
shareholders’ consent but require the willingness of at least certain creditors to equitize their debt claims
as no creditor can be forced to take equity as a consideration under a restructuring plan. Hence, if the
Notes or Note Guarantees were subject to a restructuring plan providing for debt-to-equity swap, single
holders of the Notes could not be forced under the restructuring plan to take equity in the Issuer or a
Guarantor without their respective consent. With regard to any Change of Control triggered by measures
taken in respect of the Issuer for the purpose of a debt/equity-swap as part of a restructuring plan
proceeding (Restrukturierungsplanverfahren) under German law, the Change of Control provision
could be deemed void.

The restructuring plan will be voted on by creditors of the debtor and must subsequently be confirmed
by the restructuring court. The vote may take place by way of consent solicitation process or in a
(virtual) creditors’ meeting. Creditors will be divided into classes determined on the basis of the
respective creditors’ economic interests in the debtor. As a minimum distinction, secured creditors,
unsecured creditors, creditors that benefit from intra-group credit support and subordinated creditors
(e.g. shareholders) will form separate classes. However, also other factors like, e.g., cross-holdings,
could be taken into account for class composition. 75% by value of all claims of one class will be
required to approve the plan for such class. There is no numerosity requirement. Dissenting classes can
be crammed down (or up), if:

(i) the class members can be expected to be no worse off under the restructuring plan than absent
the plan (whereby the alternative scenario must not necessarily be an in-court insolvent
liquidation, but can also be an alternative out-of-court restructuring on a going concern basis);

(ii) the crammed down (or up) class members receive an adequate share in the economic value
created by the restructuring plan; and

##### 326


-----

(iii) a majority of classes has accepted the plan.

A crammed down (or up) class receives an adequate share in the economic value created by the
restructuring plan if (i) no other creditor receives more than its claim’s par value, (ii) no creditors that
would rank junior in insolvency proceedings, the debtor or its shareholders receive any value through
the plan which is not covered by a respective stakeholder’s contribution to the plan and (iii) no creditor
that would rank pari passu in insolvency proceedings receives a preferential treatment compared to the
dissenting class under the restructuring plan (unless such preferential treatment is appropriate
(sachgerecht) in light of the individual situation of distress to overcome and the dissenting class
accounts for no more than 50% of the rank’s total claims). However, despite the prerequisite described
under (ii) in the foregoing sentence, a creditor class can also be crammed down in case a shareholder
retains equity without any additional contribution if the shareholder itself is crucial for and bindingly
committed to the continuation of the debtor’s business and the realization of the restructuring plan or
the creditors’ rights are only compromised marginally (e.g. by a maturity extension of no more than 18
months).

Upon the debtor’s decision, either the debtor or the restructuring court can lead the voting on the plan.
In case the voting has been led by the debtor, the restructuring court has to hold a hearing of affected
stakeholders before the plan can be confirmed.

The restructuring court will confirm the plan unless (i) the debtor is not (longer) imminently illiquid
(drohend zahlungsunfähig), (ii) there is a material breach of statutory provisions regarding the
procedure to adopt the restructuring plan or its permitted content that cannot or has not been cured upon
the restructuring court’s notice, (iii) claims contemplated by or surviving the restructuring plan can
obviously be not satisfied by the debtor or (iv), if new money financing is contemplated under the
restructuring plan, the underlying restructuring concept is incoherent or appears to be based on incorrect
facts or to have no reasonable prospect of success. Additionally, dissenting creditors can request the
restructuring court to reject the restructuring plan if the applicant will be expectedly worse off under
the restructuring plan than without the proposed restructuring plan and the applicant has already raised
such concern in the creditors’ meeting or creditors’ hearing, as applicable. However, such application
has no merits if the restructuring plan provides for funds to be distributed to creditors that can prove to
be worse-off, irrespective of whether any such applicant actually benefits from such funds.

Dissenting creditors can appeal against the restructuring court’s confirmation order of the plan if they
are able to produce prima facie evidence (glaubhaft machen) that they are worse-off under the
restructuring plan and funds provided thereunder to compensate worse-off creditors (if any) will not
suffice for their individual compensation. Such appeal will only have suspensive effect (aufschiebende
_Wirkung) against the effectiveness of the restructuring plan if requested by the dissenting creditor and_
ordered by the court based on serious and irreversible disadvantages for such dissenting creditor that
are not in proportion to the benefits of an immediate implementation of the restructuring plan.

Restructuring plans, which are negotiated and approved in public proceedings and confirmed by a
German restructuring court will be recognized in any EU member state pursuant to the EU Insolvency
Proceedings Regulation upon the restructuring proceedings being included as a recognized proceeding
in Exhibit A of the EU Insolvency Proceedings Regulation. This is expected to occur in July 2022. In
any other case, the recognition of the restructuring plan is subject to certain rules and regulations under
applicable international private law. As the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
has only come into force on January 1, 2021, any such recognition has – as far as can be seen – not yet
been tested as of the date of this Offering Memorandum.

**_Moratorium_**

In order for the debtor to be able to draw up and negotiate the restructuring plan, the Corporate
Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG) offers the possibility of having a moratorium ordered by
the competent court upon application by the debtor, which can restrict enforcement measures by certain

##### 327


-----

or all creditors with regards to their payment claims or the realization of respective collateral over
moveable assets. The moratorium can initially be ordered for a maximum period of up to three months,
with subsequent orders to extend the moratorium up to a maximum of eight months permissible under
certain conditions. Such moratorium may also be sanctioned with regards to collateral provided by the
debtor’s affiliates (gruppeninterne Drittsicherheiten).

The moratorium does not suspend the relevant creditor’s interest claims. However, whereas creditors
may still file an insolvency petition against the debtor during a moratorium, correspondingly initiated
insolvency proceedings are suspended for the time of the moratorium. Under certain conditions, in
particular if the requirements to terminate restructuring proceedings are met or the debtor does not
comply with certain statutory duties under the Corporate Stabilization and Restructuring Act (StaRUG)
the competent court may lift the moratorium, also on a creditor’s application.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated in Germany in the form of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”).

Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies is
subject to certain provisions of the German Limited Liability Company Act (Gesetz betreffend die
_Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”) and other laws. These provisions would also_
apply to any future German Guarantor in the form of a GmbH or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited
liability partner (e.g., _Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung & Compagnie Kommanditgesellschaft,_
“GmbH & Co. KG”).

**_GmbH Limitation Language—General_**

As a general rule, Sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from
disbursing its assets to its direct or indirect shareholders, to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s
net assets (meaning, assets minus liabilities and liability reserves as determined under German
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) is already less or would fall below the amount of its stated
share capital (Stammkapital); in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, such provisions apply to the general partner
which is a GmbH. The granting or enforcement of guarantees or security interests by a GmbH or by a
GmbH & Co. KG in order to guarantee or secure liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister
company may be considered disbursements under Sections 30 and 31. Therefore, in order to enable
German subsidiaries to issue guarantees or create security interests to secure liabilities of a direct or
indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31, it is standard market
practice for indentures, certain credit agreements, guarantees and security documents to contain
“limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in Germany in the legal
form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such limitation language, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees or the security interests agree, subject to certain adjustments and exemptions, to enforce the
guarantees or the security interests against the German subsidiary only to the extent that such
enforcement does not result in the GmbH’s (or, in case of a KG, its general partner that is a GmbH) net
assets falling below its stated share capital or, as the case may be, if the net assets are already below the
amount of its stated share capital, such enforcement would not cause such amount to be further reduced.
Accordingly, the Note Guarantees, the Indenture and the Security Documents provided by the German
Guarantors will contain such limitation language and therefore the enforcement of the Note Guarantees,
the Indenture and the Collateral is limited in the manner described. This could lead to a situation in
which the respective Note Guarantee or security granted by the relevant German Guarantor cannot be
enforced at all.

**_GmbH Limitation Language—Wording_**

The limitation language for any GmbH or GmbH & Co, KG to be incorporated into the relevant Notes
Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), in particular in the Indenture applicable to
guarantees, indemnities etc., will substantially be in the form as set out in the following section. The

(b) _GmbH Capital Impairment Limitation Language_

(i) Save as set out in this paragraph (b), the Trustee shall not enforce, and any GmbH

and to the extent a discharge (Erfüllung) or enforcement (Vollstreckung) in respect of
a Limited Upstream Obligation would cause a GmbH Capital Impairment to occur.

(ii) The restrictions in paragraph (i) shall not apply:

(A) if and to the extent the Limited Upstream Obligation of the GmbH Guarantor
secures any indebtedness under any Notes Document in respect of:

(1) amounts which are (directly or indirectly) on-lent or otherwise passed
on to the relevant GmbH Guarantor or its Subsidiaries; or

(2) bank guarantees or letters of credit that are issued for the benefit of any

relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; for the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
paragraph (ii) shall have the effect that such on-lent amounts may be enforced multiple
times (no double dip);

(B) if, at the time of enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation, a DPLA

obligations are secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation
are both Subsidiaries of a joint (direct or indirect) parent company with
such parent company as dominating entity (beherrschendes

in each case unless the mere existence of such DPLA does not lead to the inapplicability
of § 30 (1) sentence 1 GmbHG;

(C) if and to the extent any payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation is
covered (gedeckt) by a fully valuable and recoverable consideration or recourse
claim (vollwertiger Gegenleistungs- oder Rückgewähranspruch) of the GmbH
Guarantor against the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor whose obligations are
secured by the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation; or

(D) if the relevant GmbH Guarantor has not complied with its obligations pursuant
to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as applicable) below; however, if and to the
extent that the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation has been enforced

##### 330


-----

without regard to the restrictions contained in this paragraph (b) because the
Management Notification and/or the Auditor’s Determination has not (or not
in a timely manner) been delivered pursuant to paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as
applicable) below, but the Management Notification and/or Auditor’s
Determination has then been delivered within forty five (45) Business Days
from from its due date in accordance with paragraphs (iii) and/or (iv) (as
applicable) below, the Trustee shall upon written demand of the GmbH
Guarantor repay any amount received from the GmbH Guarantor which
pursuant to the Auditor’s Determination would not have been available for
enforcement, if the Auditor’s Determination had been delivered in a timely
manner.

(iii) If the relevant GmbH Guarantor does not notify the Trustee within fifteen (15) Business
Days after the making of a demand or other enforcement action against that GmbH
Guarantor under the relevant Limited Upstream Obligation:

(A) to what extent such Limited Upstream Obligation is an upstream or crossstream guarantee or indemnity; and

(B) to what extent a GmbH Capital Impairment would occur as a result of an
enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligation (setting out in reasonable
detail the amount of its GmbH Net Assets, providing an up-to-date pro forma
balance sheet),

then the restrictions set out in paragraph (i) above shall cease to applyif the GmbH
Guarantor fails to deliver the Management Notification within the deadline set out in
paragraph (ii) (D) above.

(iv) If the Trustee disagrees with the Management Notification, it may within twenty-five
(25) Business Days of its receipt, request the relevant GmbH Guarantor to provide to
the Trustee within forty (40) Business Days of receipt of such request a determination
by the Auditors or any other auditors of international standard and reputation appointed
by the GmbH Guarantor (at its own cost and expense) setting out in reasonable detail
the amount in which the payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation would cause
a GmbH Capital Impairment subject to the terms set out under this paragraph (b). Save
for manifest errors, the Auditor’s Determination shall be binding on all parties.

(v) If, after it has been provided with an Auditor’s Determination which prevented it from
demanding any or only partial payment under the Limited Upstream Obligation, the
Trustee ascertains in good faith that the financial conditions of the GmbH Guarantor as
set out in the Auditor’s Determination has substantially improved, the Trustee (acting
reasonably) may, at the GmbH Guarantor’s cost and expense, arrange for the
preparation of an updated balance sheet of the GmbH Guarantor by applying the same
principles that were used for the preparation of the Auditor’s Determination by the
auditors who prepared the Auditor’s Determination in order for such Auditors to
determine whether (and, if so, to what extent) the Capital Impairment has been cured
as result of the improvement of the financial condition of the GmbH Guarantor. The
Trustee may not arrange for the preparation of an Auditor’s Determination prior to the
expiry of three months from the date of the issuance of the preceding Auditor’s
Determination. The Trustee may only demand payment under the Limited Upstream
Obligation to the extent the Auditors determine that the Capital Impairment have been
cured.

(vi) The GmbH Net Assets shall be adjusted as follows:

##### 331


-----

(A) the amount of any increase in the registered share capital of the relevant GmbH
Guarantor which was carried out after the relevant GmbH Guarantor became a
party to this Indenture and made from retained earnings (Kapitalerhöhung aus
_Gesellschaftsmitteln) shall be deducted from the amount of the registered share_
capital (Stammkapital) of the relevant GmbH Guarantor if it is expressly
prohibited under the Notes Documents and has been carried out without the
prior written consent of the Trustee;

(B) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 253 (6) HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(C) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 268 (8) HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets;

(D) the amount of non-distributable assets according to § 272 (5) HGB shall not be
included in the calculation of GmbH Net Assets; and

(E) loans or other liabilities incurred by the relevant GmbH Guarantor in willful
(vorsätzlich) or grossly negligent (grob fahrlässig) violation of the Notes
Documents shall not be taken into account as liabilities.

(vii) Where a GmbH Guarantor claims in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph
(b) that the Note Guarantee can only be enforced in a limited amount, it shall realize,
to the extent lawful and within reasonable opinion commercially justifiable, any and
all of its assets that are shown in the balance sheet with a book value (Buchwert) that
is significantly lower than the market value of the assets and are not necessary for the
relevant GmbH Guarantor’s business (nicht betriebsnotwendig).

(c) Where the provisions of this Section [●] apply to a limited partnership
(Kommanditgesellschaft), all references to the assets of a German Guarantor shall mutatis
mutandis include a reference to the assets of the general partner (Komplementär) of such limited
partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).

(d) In addition to the terms set out in paragraphs (b) through (c) above, if a Trustee or a German
Guarantor, as applicable, demonstrates that, according to the decisions of the German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) or a higher regional court of appeals (Oberlandesgericht),
the payment under and/ or enforcement of any Limited Upstream Obligation against such
German Guarantor would or would not, as applicable, result in personal liability of its managing
director(s) (Geschäftsführer) for a reimbursement of payments made under any Limited
Upstream Obligation (including, without limitation, pursuant to §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG and/or
§ 826 BGB), the Trustee and the Issuer shall enter into good faith negotiations toadjust the
terms of this Clause to reflect any changes in the underlying German legal position.

(e) The restrictions set out in this Section [●] do not affect the rights of the Trustee to claim any
outstanding amount again at a later point in time if and to the extent the restrictions set out in
this Section [●] would allow such claim at that later point in time.

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the validity and enforceability of any Limited Upstream Obligation
granted by a German Guarantor or of any subsidiary of a German Guarantor in respect of any
borrowing liabilities which are owed by that German Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries shall
not be limited under Section [●].

(g) Nothing in this Section shall prevent the Trustee or a German Guarantor from claiming in court
that payments under and/or an enforcement of the Limited Upstream Obligations do or do not
fall within the scope of §§ 30, 31, 43 GmbHG and/or § 826 BGB (as applicable) or that the
limitations set out in this Section are not required to avoid any violation of these laws or liability
issues for any managing director (Geschäftsführer).

##### 332


-----

(h) Nothing in this Section [●] shall constitute a waiver (Verzicht) of any right granted under this
Indenture or any other Notes Document to the Trustee or vice versa.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture, this Section [●] and any rights
and/or obligations arising out of it shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with,
German law.

German capital maintenance, liquidity maintenance and financial assistance rules (including with
respect to Sections 30, 31 GmbHG) are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future
court rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of its subsidiaries constituted in
the form of a GmbH, which can negatively affect the ability of the German Guarantors to make
payments on the Notes or the Note Guarantees or the enforceability of the Note Guarantees, the
Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral provided by the German Guarantors.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court
(Bundesgerichtshof) regarding destructive interference (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (meaning, a
situation in which a shareholder deprives a GmbH of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own
payment obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a Guarantee or other
collateral granted by the German Guarantors. In such a case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in
an enforcement process may be reduced, even to nil. Moreover, according to a decision of the German
Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a security agreement may be void due to tortious
inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the stressed financial situation of the debtor
and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by disregarding the vital interests of
its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply this case law with
respect to the granting of the Note Guarantee or any Collateral by the German Guarantors.

Furthermore, the beneficiary (for example, a holder of Notes) of a transaction qualifying as a repayment
of the stated share capital of the grantor of a guarantee or security interest, as applicable (for example,
the provision or the enforcement of a guarantee or security interest), could become personally liable
under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that
this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with the intention of detrimentally
influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal principle of bonos
mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction was aware
of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee or provider of security interest is close
to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

_Parallel Debt; Security Interests_

Under German law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges (Pfandrechte) require that the
pledgee and the creditor of the secured claim be the same person. Such accessory security interests
(akzessorische Sicherungsrechte) cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not (yet) hold the
secured claim, will automatically lapse to the extent a secured claim is settled, discharged or novated,
and may not be assigned independently, but will automatically follow the claims they secure in case the
relevant secured claim is assigned. The holders of the Notes from time to time will not be party to the
Security Documents. In order to permit the holders of the Notes from time to time to benefit from
pledges granted to the Security Agent under German law, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for
the creation of a Parallel Debt (as defined therein). Pursuant to the creation of the Parallel Debt, the
Security Agent has its own separate and independent claim equal to each amount payable by each
obligor under, in particular, the Notes and the Note Guarantees. The pledges governed by German law
will directly and exclusively secure the Parallel Debt rather than the obligations under the Notes or the
Note Guarantees or the holders of the Notes directly. The validity of the Parallel Debt concept and of
the pledges granted under German law to secure such Parallel Debt has not been tested before German
courts, and there is no certainty that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability posed by
German law. Therefore, the ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted. In
addition, holders of the Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the

##### 333


-----

Security Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—The
_security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the_
_holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be_
_restricted by local law.”_

German law does not generally permit the appropriation of pledged assets by the pledgee upon
enforcement of the pledge. The enforcement of a share pledge under German law usually requires the
sale of the asset constituting the collateral through a formal process involving a public auction to which
certain waiting periods and notice requirements apply. Under German law, it is unclear whether the
security interest in the collateral gives the Security Agent the right to prevent other creditors of the
entities having granted such security from foreclosing on and realizing the asset constituting the
collateral. Some courts have held that certain types of security interests only give their holders priority
(according to their ranking) in the distribution of any proceeds from the realization of the asset
constituting the collateral and no right to intervene (meaning, the right to request the court to impose a
stay on proceedings initiated by other creditors).

In addition, under German law, a creditor who provided additional, or extended existing funding to a
debtor or obtained security from a debtor may be liable in tort if such creditor was aware of the debtor’s
(impending) insolvency or of circumstances indicating such debtor’s (impending) insolvency at the time
such funding was provided or extended or such security was granted. The German Federal Supreme
Court (Bundesgerichtshof) held that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor was to act with
the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of
the legal principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary
of the transaction was aware of any circumstances indicating that the debtor as the grantor of the
guarantee or security was close to collapse (Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with
respect thereto.

**Austria**

Some of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Austria and have their centre of main interests
in Austria or may at least have assets located in Austria. In the event of insolvency, insolvency
proceedings may, therefore, be opened against such Guarantors in Austria which are governed by the
Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung — IO; Federal Law Gazette No. 337/1914 as last amended
by Federal Law Gazette I No. 86/2021) (the “AIA”). Creditors’ rights might also be affected by the
Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Federal Law Gazette I No. 114/1997 as last amended by Federal
Law Gazette I No. 43/2016; Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz), which does not govern insolvency
proceedings but regulates the reorganization of companies in financial distress. The AIA regulates on
the one hand liquidation proceedings in which the debtor’s assets or company as a whole are sold and
the proceeds are distributed among its creditors. On the other hand it also provides for restructuring
proceedings - insolvency enabling the debtor to discharge its liabilities through quota payments and to
continue its activities under certain conditions. The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act, which
regulates reorganization proceedings for enterprises threatened by insolvency, is not designed to assist
creditors in satisfying their claims, but rather to support the reorganization of the debtor’s enterprise.
The insolvency laws of Austria may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency
laws of other jurisdictions including in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain postpetition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. As a result, your ability to recover
payments due on the Notes may be limited to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other
insolvency laws.

The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2019 on
restructuring and insolvency will have to be implemented into Austrian law until 17 July 2021 (please
see the respective section below).

##### 334


-----

**_The Austrian Insolvency Act (Insolvenzordnung)_**

Insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzverfahren) must be opened by a court in the event that the debtor is
insolvent or illiquid (zahlungsunfähig), i.e. unable to pay its debts when they fall due, or is overindebted within the meaning of the AIA (insolvenzrechtlich überschuldet), i.e. that its liabilities exceed
the liquidation values of its assets in combination with a negative prognosis on its ability to continue as
a going concern (negative _Fortbestehensprognose), provided that the insolvency estate’s value is_
sufficient to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. Under Austrian law, insolvency
proceedings may be initiated either by the debtor or a creditor by filing an application to that effect with
a court of competent jurisdiction. If insolvency proceedings are initiated upon a creditor’s request, such
creditor will have to demonstrate that the debtor is insolvent or over-indebted. In the event that the
debtor is at imminent risk of being unable to pay its debts when they fall due (drohende
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit), insolvency proceedings may be initiated upon the debtor’s request only._

Depending on whether or not the debtor presents a restructuring plan - insolvency (Sanierungsplan)
together with the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings, the insolvency proceedings are
initiated as restructuring proceedings - insolvency (Sanierungsverfahren) or bankruptcy proceedings
(Konkursverfahren). If the debtor has applied for the initiation of insolvency proceedings as
restructuring proceedings - insolvency and has submitted a permissible restructuring plan - insolvency
(Sanierungsplan) offering a recovery rate of at least 20% payable to the unsecured creditors
(Insolvenzgläubiger) over a maximum period of two years (in case of entrepreneurs), any proceedings
so initiated by the court will be in the form of restructuring proceedings - insolvency. Due to Covid-19
regulations, the maximum payment period for a restructuring plan - insolvency is extended from two to
three years (Section 11a 2. COVID-19-JuBG). Applications for establishing a restructuring plan –
insolvency are covered, which are submitted by 31 December 2021. A debtor may also present such
restructuring plan - insolvency in the course of bankruptcy proceedings whereby, if the restructuring
plan - insolvency was presented after the bankruptcy proceedings were opened, such proceedings will
then continue as bankruptcy proceedings (Konkursverfahren). For the debtor’s restructuring plan insolvency to be approved by the court, the criteria set forth in the AIA need to be fulfilled.

The purpose of the restructuring plan - insolvency is to enable a debtor to be released from a portion of
its debts (up to 80% of the aggregate amount thereof) and to continue its business activities. A creditors’
meeting (Sanierungsplantagsatzung) is to take place within 60 to 90 days after the opening of the
proceedings. The restructuring plan - insolvency has to be approved by a “qualified majority” of the
debtor’s unsecured creditors. A “qualified majority” refers to a majority of the debtor’s unsecured
creditors present at the respective court hearing, provided that such majority represents more than 50%
of the aggregate amount of all unsecured creditors’ claims present at the hearing. If the restructuring
plan - insolvency is approved by the creditors, confirmed by the court and fulfilled by the debtor, the
latter is released from the remainder of its unsecured debt. If the debtor applies for the opening of
insolvency proceedings and, inter alia, presents a restructuring plan - insolvency offering a recovery
rate of at least 30% to the unsecured creditors over a maximum period of two years (three years under
the current COVID-19 regulations, see above) after the approval of such restructuring plan - insolvency,
the debtor qualifies for self-administration, so called “debtor-in-possession” proceedings
(Sanierungsverfahren mit Eigenverwaltung) which may be withdrawn, if, for example, negative effects
on the creditors’ positions can be expected. If the realization of a restructuring plan - insolvency fails,
the insolvency proceedings will be continued as bankruptcy proceedings.

Unless the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the debtor is not allowed as of the date of the opening
of the insolvency or, as the case may be, the restructuring proceedings - insolvency, to dispose of the
assets belonging to the insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse). The opening takes effect as of the beginning
of the day following publication of the court’s order to open such proceedings in the official online
insolvency data base (www.edikte.justiz.gv.at). After the initiation of insolvency proceedings,
transactions of the debtor with respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate take no effect towards
respective creditors. With its order to open insolvency proceedings, the court will appoint an insolvency
administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) and may, depending on the nature and the size of the debtor’s

##### 335


-----

business or in case certain legal requirements are met (e.g. intended sale of the entire business of the
debtor), appoint a creditors’ committee (Gläubigerausschuss) to assist the insolvency administrator in
the discharge of its duties. After the opening of insolvency proceedings (and unless the debtor qualifies
for self-administration) only the insolvency administrator is entitled to act on behalf of the insolvency
estate.

The insolvency administrator’s main task is to administer and realize the assets of the insolvency estate.
According to Austrian insolvency law, the insolvency administrator shall generally continue the
debtor’s business in order to enable a potential reorganization of the debtor’s business either by
implementing the debtor’s restructuring plan - insolvency (which he may also apply for during the
bankruptcy proceedings) or by a sale of the debtor’s business. If neither a restructuring plan - insolvency
nor a sale of the debtor’s business is possible, the insolvency administrator will discontinue the debtor’s
business activities. As a result of the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor’s assets will be
liquidated and such liquidation proceeds realized thereby will be distributed to the debtor’s creditors
with the debtor remaining liable for any portion of its debts not satisfied by such proceeds.

If the debtor qualifies for self-administration, the court will appoint a restructuring administrator
(Sanierungsverwalter) to monitor the activities of the debtor. In such case, certain transactions are either
subject to the restructuring administrator’s approval or may be performed only by the restructuring
administrator.

Unsecured creditors wishing to assert their claim against the debtor are required to participate in the
insolvency proceeding and must file their claim with the competent court within the time period set out
in the court order opening the insolvency proceedings. At the so-called examination hearing
(Prüfungstagsatzung), which is held at the competent court, the insolvency administrator has to declare
whether he acknowledges or challenges a claim filed. Under certain circumstances, a claim can still be
filed after this examination hearing. If the insolvency administrator acknowledges a creditor’s claim,
this creditor is entitled to participate in the insolvency proceeding, which means that he will finally
receive the quota that is distributed to the unsecured creditors. If a creditor’s claim is challenged by the
insolvency administrator, the creditor has to assert its claim in civil proceedings in order to maintain its
right to participate in the insolvency proceedings.

Claims of unsecured creditors which were created before the opening of the insolvency proceedings
rank pari passu among themselves. Taxes and social security contributions (to the extent the situation
giving rise to the claim occurs during the insolvency proceeding), wages and salaries (for time periods
after the opening of insolvency proceeding) as well as other sorts of claims which lawfully arose against
the insolvency estate after the opening of the insolvency proceedings (preferred claims
(Masseforderungen)) enjoy priority in insolvency proceedings. Claims which are secured by collateral
(e.g. by a mortgage over property, a pledge over bank accounts, shares or an assignment of receivables
or a security transfer of moveable assets (preferential claims (Absonderungsansprüche), are entitled to
preferential payment in the distribution of the proceeds resulting from the realization of the charged
assets. Creditors who have a right to preferential treatment may participate in the pro rata distribution
to unsecured creditors only to the extent that the proceeds from the realisation of the assets charged to
them did not cover their claims or if they have waived their right to preferential treatment. Secured
creditors do not have a voting right with respect to the approval of the restructuring plan - insolvency
to the extent their claim is covered by security.

The costs of the insolvency proceedings and certain liabilities accrued during insolvency proceedings
constitute privileged claims and rank prior to all other unsecured claims (Insolvenzforderungen). Claims
of creditors with a right for separation of assets (Aussonderungsberechtigte), such as creditors with a
retention of title or beneficiaries of a trust, remain unaffected by the opening of insolvency proceedings
though they may be barred from exercising their rights for a maximum period of six months following
the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the exercise of such rights would endanger the carrying on of
the debtor’s business and the interdiction does not cause a severe personal or economic damage to the

##### 336


-----

secured creditor. The same limitation applies for secured creditors of preferential claims
(Absonderungsberechtigte).

Once insolvency proceedings have been opened it is no longer possible to obtain an execution lien with
respect to assets belonging to the insolvency estate. All execution proceedings against the debtor are
subject to an automatic stay (moratorium, Vollstreckungssperre). Execution liens obtained within the
last 60 days prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings expire upon the opening of such insolvency
proceedings (subject to certain exemptions), unless the insolvency proceedings are closed due to lack
of funds to cover the costs of the insolvency proceedings.

Powers of attorney granted by the debtor and certain other legal relationships cease to be effective upon
the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Section 25a paragraph I AIA provides that for a period of six months from the opening of insolvency
proceedings contractual partners of the debtor may terminate contracts only for cause. In this context,
the deterioration of the economic situation or the lack of timely performance by the debtor prior to the
opening of insolvency proceedings is not considered a cause allowing termination. This restriction only
applies if a termination of a contract would jeopardize the continuation of the debtor’s business. No
restrictions apply if a termination of a contract is inevitable to prevent the contractual partner from
incurring severe personal or economic damage or if the debtor does not timely perform its contractual
obligations after the opening of the insolvency proceedings. Pursuant to section 25b para 2 AIA, a
contractual stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from the agreement or for an automatic
termination in the event of opening of insolvency proceedings against the other party is not enforceable.

**_The Right of Challenging in the Event of Insolvency Proceedings_**

Legal actions (Rechtshandlungen) and legal transactions (Rechtsgeschäfte) (including, without
limitation, the granting of security, guarantees, assuming and/or paying of debt) that have taken place
within certain suspect periods prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings may be subject to a
challenge by the insolvency administrator according to the challenge rules of the AIA. General
requirements for challenging legal actions or legal transactions are: (i) the challenge must result in an
increase of the insolvency estate (Befriedigungstauglichkeit); (ii) the challenged legal action or
challenged legal transaction took place within a certain “hardening” period (which vary from 60 days
to 10 years depending on the parties involved in the challenged legal action or transaction) and must
have caused a direct or indirect discrimination of the other creditors (Gläubigerbenachteiligung); and
(iii) the challenge must be filed by the insolvency administrator within one year after the opening of the
insolvency proceedings at the latest (whereas, the insolvency administrator and the challenged party
(Anfechtungsgegner) can agree on a one-time extension of such period of up to three months).

In particular, the following legal transactions and legal acts are voidable:

- Challenge due to intent to discriminate (Anfechtung wegen Benachteiligungsabsicht; section 28
nos. 1-3 AIA): Transactions concluded by the debtor in order to discriminate its creditors may
be challenged if they were entered into within 10 years preceding the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the other party knew about the debtor’s intention to discriminate. If the other
party was not aware but should have been aware of the debtor’s intention to discriminate against
its creditors the period is shortened to two years prior to the opening of the insolvency
proceedings. If the legal act was concluded with or for the benefit of certain affiliated parties
(as defined by law) the burden of proof regarding the knowledge of the intention to discriminate
is shifted to that affiliated party, i.e. the affiliated party must prove that he or she had no
knowledge and was not negligent in having no knowledge respectively. Should the debtor be a
legal entity capable of being a party in a lawsuit then members of the managing and supervisory
bodies of the debtor as well as the debtor’s shareholders with unlimited liability and the debtor’s
controlling shareholders or at least 25% shareholders (pursuant to section 5 of the Austrian
Substitute Equity Act Federal Law Gazette I No. 92/2003 as last amended by Federal Law

##### 337


-----

Gazette I No. 58/2010; _Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz — “EKEG”) are deemed to be affiliated_
parties.

- Challenge due to squandering of assets (Anfechtung wegen Vermögensverschleuderung;
_section 28 no 4 AIA): Challenging is applicable to certain contracts, including purchase and_
exchange contracts, entered into by the debtor that are considered a squandering of assets at the
expense of creditors, if the counterparty to the contract had, or should have had, knowledge of
such squandering. Squandering of assets is assumed if an obvious disproportion exists between
performance and consideration. Section 28 no 4 AIA applies to transactions that took place
within one year prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

- Challenge of transactions with no consideration and analogous transactions (Anfechtung wegen
_unentgeltlicher oder ihnen gleichgestellter Verfügungen; section 29 AIA): Dispositions of the_
debtor that were concluded free of charge or are equivalent to such dispositions and acquisitions
of assets from the debtor by order of authority if paid out of the debtor’s funds may be
challenged. A disposition free of charge requires that the disposing person acts with the
intention not to receive any consideration in return. Examples for such dispositions are:
donations, acknowledgement of a debt, security of liabilities, and payment of someone else’s
debt. If the debtor receives an adequate service in return (angemessenes _Entgelt) or the_
transaction is covered by certain exemptions (such as customary occasional gifts and
transactions for a reasonable and proportionate amount towards a charitable cause) the
disposition may not be challenged pursuant section 29 AIA. Any economic benefit or interest
may be qualified as a consideration. Section 29 AIA applies to dispositions concluded within
two years prior to the opening of insolvency proceedings.

- Challenge due to preferential treatment (Anfechtung wegen Begünstigung; section 30 AIA):
The payment of or granting of security to a creditor (Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) after
the occurrence of material insolvency or after a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings or within the preceding 60 days may be challenged if (i) the creditor obtained
security or satisfaction to which it was not, or not in that way or at that time, entitled, unless it
was not favoured by this transaction (objective preferential treatment) or (ii) the transaction
was effected for the benefit of a creditor who knew or should have known about the debtor’s
intention of the preferential treatment (subjective preferential treatment) or (iii) the transaction
was effected for the benefit of an affiliated party, unless such affiliated party proves that it did
not know and should not have known about the debtor’s intention to give preferential treatment
(see above as to section 28 nos. 1-3 AIA). Material insolvency means illiquidity
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or over-indebtedness in terms of insolvency law (insolvenzrechtliche
_Überschuldung). Objective preferential treatment does not require any subjective elements on_
part of the counterparty. In particular, the counterparty’s knowledge of the financial condition
of the debtor is irrelevant.

Subjective preferential treatment requires the debtor’s intention and the creditor’s knowledge of the
debtor’s intention to favor a creditor. Transactions carried out more than one year before the opening
of the insolvency proceedings may not be challenged pursuant to section 30 AIA.

- _Challenge_ _due_ _to_ _knowledge_ _of_ _illiquidity_ _(Anfechtung_ _wegen_ _Kenntnis_ _der_
_Zahlungsunfähigkeit; section 31 AIA):_ Pursuant to section 31 AIA the following legal acts
effected after the occurrence of material insolvency or after filing a petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings may be challenged (unless such legal acts were effected earlier than 6
months prior to the opening of the insolvency proceedings, see section 31 para 2 AIA):

(i) any legal act which constitutes payment of or granting of security
(Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) to an affiliated party (see above as to as to
section 28 nos. 1-3 AIA), and any other legal transaction entered into by the
debtor with such affiliated party which is considered to be disadvantageous to
the creditors of the debtor (nachteilige Rechtsgeschäfte), unless in case of

##### 338


-----

payment, granting of security or a directly disadvantageous transaction such
affiliated party did not have or should not have had knowledge of the debtor’s
insolvency or pending insolvency petition and, in case of any other (indirectly
disadvantageous) legal transactions, in addition the disadvantage with respect
to the insolvency estate was objectively not predictable at the time of the
transaction;

(ii) any legal act which constitutes payment of or granting of security
(Befriedigung oder Sicherstellung) with respect to another creditor, as well as
any other legal transaction entered into by the debtor with any person which is
directly disadvantageous to its creditors, in each case provided the debtor’s
counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor’s illiquidity,
respectively over-indebtedness or pending insolvency petition;

(iii) any legal transactions entered into by the debtor with any person which are
indirectly disadvantageous to creditors, provided that (i) the debtor’s
counterparty knew or should have known of the debtor’s illiquidity,
respectively over-indebtedness or pending insolvency petition and (ii) the
disadvantage with respect to the insolvency estate was objectively foreseeable
at the time of the transaction. Such objective predictability exists, in particular,
when a restructuring concept is obviously unsuitable (offensichtlich
_untaugliches Sanierungskonzept). A transaction is considered to be indirectly_
disadvantageous (mittelbar nachteilig) even though it is objectively balanced,
i.e. not directly disadvantageous, but nonetheless lowers the recovery rate of
creditors.

In addition to the insolvency administrator challenging transactions according to the AIA, a creditor
who has obtained an enforcement order (Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also challenge any
transactions pursuant to the provisions of the Austrian Enforcement Code (Exekutionsordnung) outside
of formal insolvency proceedings. The conditions for such action vary to a certain extent from the rules
described above, and the challenging periods are calculated from the date on which such other creditor
exercises its rights of challenging in the courts.

**_Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung)_**

The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of 20 June 2019 on
restructuring and insolvency will have to be implemented into Austrian law until mid-2021. The draft
of the new Austrian Restructuring Code (Restrukturierungsordnung, ReO) has already been submitted
to the Austrian parliament. However, the law has not yet passed the Austrian parliament. Therefore, it
cannot be foreseen whether last minute changes to the draft presented will occur.

The principles of the new Austrian Restructuring Code can be outlined as following:

At the request of a debtor, pre-insolvency restructuring proceedings may be initiated upon the debtor’s
likely insolvency (wahrscheinliche Insolvenz) to enable the debtor to restructure its business in order to
prevent insolvency and ensure viability (Bestandfähigkeit). This includes changing the terms or
structure of the assets and liabilities or any other part of the capital structure of the debtor’s business,
such as the sale of assets or business units and the overall sale of the business, as well as any necessary
operational measures. According to the Austrian Restructuring Code, the probability of insolvency
occurs if the existence of the debtor’s company would be at risk without restructuring. This is the case
in particular if illiquidity is imminent (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) or the equity ratio falls below
8% and the assumed debt repayment period exceeds 15 years. In that case, an application for
restructuring proceedings may be filed.

In general, a restructuring plan - restructuring (Restrukturierungsplan) must be submitted to court with
the application for the initiation of restructuring proceedings. This shall include a description of the

##### 339


-----

debtor’s economic situation, the affected creditors selected by the debtor (divided into creditor classes),
the proposed restructuring measures, the duration of the restructuring and a qualified going concern
prognosis. New financing contained in a restructuring plan restructuring and interim financing approved
by the court are not challengeable under section 31 para 1 no 3 AIA if the opposing party did not know
about the debtor’s insolvency. In addition, certain transactions in connection with a restructuring
proceeding are protected from challenging under section 31 AIA if they have been approved by the
court and the opposing party did not know about the debtor’s insolvency. Other than under Austrian
insolvency proceedings not all creditors of the debtor need to be involved and not all classes of creditors
have to be dealt equally. Each such class is eligible for a different debt relief (Schuldenreduktion).
Therefore, the respective members of each creditor class receive an adequate share of their claim created
by the restructuring plan – restructuring.

If necessary, the court shall appoint a restructuring officer (Restrukturierungsbeauftragter) to assist the
debtor and the creditors in the preparation of the restructuring plan - restructuring. The debtor must
make an advance payment for the costs of the restructuring officer. However, the debtor retains (at least
partial) control over its assets and the daily operation of its business during the restructuring
proceedings.

In order to support the negotiations on the restructuring plan - restructuring for debtor, the court may
order a moratorium (Vollstreckungssperre) if necessary, which can restrict certain enforcement
measures. The moratorium is imposed for a period of time as required for the restructuring, up to a
maximum duration of three months. Prolongations or renewals up to an aggregate duration of 6 months
are possible. During such a moratorium, debtor is not obliged to file an application for the opening of
insolvency proceedings due to over indebtedness (Überschuldung).

The court shall order a hearing within 30 to 60 days after the restructuring plan - restructuring has been
submitted. The restructuring plan - restructuring must be accepted by a “qualified majority” of the
affected creditors in each class. A “qualified majority” refers to a majority of the debtor’s affected
creditors in each class present at the respective court hearing, provided that such majority represents
more than 75% of the aggregate amount of the affected creditors’ claims in this class present at the
hearing. Under particular circumstances, a cross-class cramdown is possible. Afterwards, the
restructuring plan is approved by the court. It then becomes binding for all affected creditors named in
the restructuring plan - restructuring. In that case, the restructuring proceedings are annulled.

Furthermore, a short form proceeding involving only financial creditors will be available.

If the restructuring proceedings fails and the moratorium is revoked, the debtor still has to file for
insolvency if necessary.

**_Recognition of the choice of New York laws by Austrian courts_**

In general, the choice of the laws of New York to govern the Note Guarantees would be recognized by
Austrian courts. In case of a dispute before an Austrian court, the Austrian court would apply the
substantive laws of New York with respect to the substance matter and would apply applicable Austrian
Civil Procedure Laws (Zivilprozessverfahren) with respect to procedural matters. However, an Austrian
court may refuse to apply and/or to enforce any provision governed by the laws of New York (as it
applies to any Note Guarantees) if the respective provision is contrary to Austrian public policy (ordre
public) or mandatory provisions under Austrian law or if the law of another jurisdiction must be applied
regardless of the chosen law.

**_The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz)_**

The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz — “URG”) governs
business reorganisations, which are designed to enable businesses in temporary financial distress to
continue to do business after having undergone a reorganization procedure. Only the debtor may apply

##### 340


-----

for the opening of a reorganization procedure, provided, however, that it is still solvent at the time of
its application. The relevant criteria for the opening of a business reorganization procedure are a quota
of own funds (Eigenmittelquote) of less than 8% and a fictitious duration of debt redemption period
(fiktive Schuldentilgungsdauer) of more than 15 years, each as defined in, and determined in accordance
with, the Austrian Business Reorganisation Act. Failure to timely apply for the opening of
reorganization proceedings may result in personal liability of the representatives of the relevant
corporation. Pursuant to section 19 of the Austrian Business Reorganisation Act, a contractual
stipulation providing for the right to withdraw from an agreement or for its automatic termination or for
the maturity of a loan in the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings relating to the other
party is void and by such not enforceable.

**_The Austrian Substitute Equity Law_**

It may not be able to enforce, or recover any amounts under any Note Guarantees by an Austrian
Guarantor that is a subsidiary of the Issuer due to restrictions under the Austrian substitute equity law
(Federal Law Gazette No. 92/2003 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 58/2010;
_Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz, “EKEG”)._

The EKEG contains detailed provisions regarding equity replacing shareholder loans. In particular, the
EKEG stipulates that a loan granted by a “shareholder” to its subsidiary which is in a financial crisis
(i.e., the subsidiary is illiquid, over-indebted or the requirements of a business reorganization procedure
are met, see above at The Austrian Business Reorganisation Act (Unternehmensreorganisationsgesetz))
is deemed to be re-characterized as equity. In a financial crisis, such re-characterized shareholder loans
(i.e., principal amount and any interest accrued thereupon) must not be repaid and any security granted
in connection with such loans may not be enforced until the borrowing/guaranteeing subsidiary has
been reorganized or restructured. This means, in particular, that in an insolvency, the respective claims
of the shareholder lender are subordinated. A “shareholder” is defined to be (i) a shareholder with
controlling participation, (ii) a shareholder with a participation of at least 25% and (iii) any person not
holding a participation in the company but having a controlling influence (beherrschenden Einfluss)
with regard to the company. Furthermore, a person granting a loan/credit to a company is to be
considered as “shareholder” if (i) it holds a participation or other rights in a person other than the
company receiving the loan/credit which has a dominant (beherrschenden) influence regarding the
company that has received the loan/credit (indirect controlling participation), or (ii) it indirectly holds
a participation in the company receiving the loan/credit of at least 33%, or (iii) it holds a controlling
direct or indirect participation in a company which holds a participation of at least 25% in the company
receiving the loan/credit (section 8 EKEG).

Prior to the enactment of the EKEG, the Austrian Supreme Court had developed even stricter rules on
equity substituting shareholder loans. Following this, it is unclear whether, in addition to the provisions
of the EKEG, such rules (or certain of its rules) developed by the Austrian Supreme Court are still
applicable/relevant and would be applied by Austrian courts. In this context it must be noted that it is
uncertain whether the rules on equity substituting shareholder loans also apply to “a-typical pledgees”
(atypische Pfandgläubiger) and/or under what circumstances a secured lender may qualify as a-typical
pledgee.

**_Limitations on the Validity and the Enforceability of Guarantees by Austrian Companies_**

The Austrian subsidiaries of the Issuer are incorporated in Austria in the form of a limited liability
company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbH”).

Consequently, the granting of guarantees, indemnities and security interests by these companies within
the Group is subject to certain provisions of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz
_über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung “GmbHG”) and other laws. These provisions would also_
apply to any future Austrian Guarantor in the form of a GmbH, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft;

##### 341


-----

“AG”) or a partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner (e.g., Gesellschaft mit beschränkter
_Haftung & Compagnie Kommanditgesellschaft, “GmbH & Co. KG”)._

**_Capital Maintenance – General_**

It may not be able to enforce, or recover any amounts under any Note Guarantees of an Austrian
subsidiaries of the Issuer that is a Guarantor due to restrictions on enforcement reflecting Austrian
corporate law.

The provision and enforcement of upstream and cross stream guarantees by Austrian subsidiaries of the
Issuer may be limited by capital maintenance rules on the preservation of corporate assets pursuant to
Austrian corporate laws, in particular sections 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability
Companies (Federal Law Gazette No. 58/1906 as last amended by Federal Law Gazette I No. 86/2021;
_Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung, “GmbHG”) and/or sections 52 and 65 et seq. of_
the Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 98/1965 as last amended by Federal
Law Gazette I No. 86/2021; Aktiengesetz). These rules protect the assets of the Austrian subsidiaries of
the Issuer for the benefit of their respective creditors. The entire set of corporate assets, even those
exceeding the registered share capital, is protected by Austrian capital maintenance rules. Austrian
capital maintenance rules prohibit corporations or limited partnerships of which the general partner/s is
or are corporations, from disbursing its assets to its shareholders in circumstances other than as a
distribution of profits (if, to the extent and as long as available for distribution under Austrian law), by
a reduction of share capital or as liquidation surplus on liquidation of that corporations. Guarantees by
an Austrian corporation or limited partnership (the unlimited liability partner of which is a corporation)
in order to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered
disbursements and are thus invalid and unenforceable if the granting of such guarantees by the Austrian
subsidiary were not for the Austrian subsidiary’s corporate benefit (betrieblich gerechtfertigt). Austrian
corporate law does not recognize group interest and thus any corporate benefit (betrieblich
gerechtfertigt) must be tested at the level of the individual Austrian subsidiary; a benefit solely for the
group (but not for the individual Austrian subsidiary) would not be sufficient. Any transaction that
violate Austrian capital maintenance rules are null and void.

This nullity may also affect third parties (e.g., noteholders) if such third party knew or should have
known (gross negligence) that the respective transaction was not permitted pursuant to Austrian capital
maintenance rules.

Therefore, in order to reduce the risk of violating Austrian capital maintenance rules and the resultant
invalidity and unenforceability of a guarantee, it is standard market practice for indentures and
guarantees to include so-called “limitation language” in relation to Austrian subsidiaries (see also
_Limitation Language – Wording). Pursuant to such limitation language the guarantees of an Austrian_
subsidiary are given only to the extent this does not result in a breach of Austrian capital maintenance
rules. Accordingly, the Indenture will contain such limitation language and any Note Guarantees by an
Austrian subsidiary of the Issuer will be so limited. No case law is, however, available to confirm and
it is thus not certain whether such limitations, in particular regarding a limitation of a Note Guarantee
to abide by the Austrian capital maintenance rules as with the limitation language, would be valid and
enforceable under Austrian law and achieve the desired effect of legally preserving such Note Guarantee
to the extent possible or whether such Note Guarantee could be deemed void in its entirety.

Moreover, Austrian capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. It can therefore not be
ruled out that future court decisions may not further limit the access of creditors to assets of our Austrian
subsidiaries and thus the enforceability of any Note Guarantees, which could negatively affect our
ability to make payment on the Notes or the ability of the Austrian subsidiaries of the Issuer that are
Guarantor to make payments on the Note Guarantees.

##### 342


-----

**_Limitation Language_**

The limitation language for any GmbH, partnership with a GmbH as unlimited liability partner or AG
to be incorporated into the relevant Notes Documents (as defined in “Description of the Notes”), or any
other Finance Document and/or Debt Document (together the “Financial Documents”), will
substantially be in the form as follows.

The Guarantees must not be used for payments that violate any laws (in particular, the prohibition to
make payments that violate Austrian capital maintenance rules _(österreichische_
_Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) or the Austrian substitute equity law (Eigenkapitalersatz-Gesetz,_
“EKEG”).

(a) Definitions in this Section:

“Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules” refers to (whether directly applicable or per analogiam)
Austrian capital maintenance rules (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften) pursuant to Austrian
corporate laws, in particular sections 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability
Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften mit beschränkter Haftung) and/or sections 52 and 65
et seq. of the Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz).

“Maximum Amount” means the maximum guaranteed amount which the respective Restricted
Obligor is permitted to guarantee pursuant to the guarantee and indemnity given by it pursuant
to the respective agreement without violating Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules.

“Restricted Obligor” means any Obligor that is a company:

(A) that is incorporated and registered with the Austrian companies register
(Firmenbuch); or

(B) that, if a company incorporated and registered in a non-EU member state, has the real
seat of its administration in the Republic of Austria; or

(C) to which Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules otherwise (whether directly applicable
or per analogiam) apply; or

(D) in which any company listed in paragraph (A) above holds a (direct or indirect) equity
interest (for example, a foreign Subsidiary of an Austrian company with limited
liability).

“Restricted Obligor’s Obligations” means the obligations (Verpflichtungen) and liabilities
(Haftungen) of a Restricted Obligor under the terms of the respective agreement (in particular
the guarantee and indemnity under the terms of the respective agreement).

“Risk of Director’s Liability” means the risk that the entry into or performance of a Financial
Document by a Restricted Obligor would conflict with the mandatory fiduciary duties and/or
would result into any personal liability or criminal responsibility of a managing director or
member of the supervisory board of a company listed in paragraph (A) of the definition
“Restricted Obligor” (for example, an obligation to render a shareholder resolution for approval
that a foreign Subsidiary becomes a Guarantor or provides a Transaction Security Interest that
leads to a violation of Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules by such company).

(b) Limitation Language - Wording

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Financial Document, the Restricted Obligor’s
Obligations shall at all times be limited so that at no time shall a Restricted Obligor be required to
assume such Restricted Obligor’s Obligations to the extent it would violate Austrian Capital

##### 343


-----

Maintenance Rules and/or result in a Risk of Director’s Liability. In case any Restricted Obligor’s
Obligations would violate Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and result in a Risk of Director’s
Liability, such Restricted Obligor’s Obligations shall be deemed to be replaced by an obligation
(Verpflichtung) or liability (Haftung) by the respective Restricted Obligor of a similar nature (i) which
provides an equivalent security interest in favour of the Finance Parties; (ii) which is in compliance
with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules; and (iii) which does not result in a Risk of Director’s
Liability. By way of example, should it be held that a guarantee and indemnity pursuant to the respective
agreement by a Restricted Obligor contradicts Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules in relation to any
amount of the guaranteed claims, then the payment obligation under the guarantee and indemnity
pursuant to the respective agreement shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted to be payable
under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules and which does not result in a Risk of Director’s Liability.
Whereas the Parties acknowledge that this may have the effect of reducing such payment obligation to
zero, no reduction of an amount enforceable hereunder pursuant to these limitations will prejudice the
rights of any Finance Party to continue enforcing (to the extent applicable), subject to the limitations
pursuant to the respective agreement, its rights under the Financial Documents until full satisfaction of
the guaranteed obligations.

(i) Subject to Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules the Maximum Amount shall not be less
than the sum of:

(A) that company’s distributable balance sheet profit (Bilanzgewinn) as defined in
section 224 para 3 item A no. IV of the Austrian Enterprise Code
(Unternehmensgesetzbuch) as calculated by reference to the most recent
(audited, if applicable, and approved (festgestellt)) financial statements of that
company then available and always provided that the shareholders of such
Restricted Obligor have passed the relevant distribution resolution
(Ausschüttungsbeschluss);

(B) PLUS any other amounts which are freely available or can be converted into
amounts freely available for distribution to that company’s shareholder(s) under
the Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz über Gesellschaften
_mit beschränkter Haftung) or the Austrian Joint-Stock Corporation Act_
(Aktiengesetz), as applicable, and the Austrian Enterprise Code
(Unternehmensgesetzbuch) (in particular, unrestricted reserves (freie
_Rücklagen)) at the time or times payment under or in connection the respective_
agreement is requested from that company and always provided that the
shareholders of that company have passed the relevant distribution resolution
(Ausschüttungsbeschluss) and have taken any other steps required by law for
distribution at the relevant point in time in accordance with Austrian law;

(C) PLUS (subject to paragraph (i)) the equivalent of the aggregate Loans borrowed
by any Borrower and made available to that company in form of intercompany
financing arrangements (on-lending)

(D) provided that, in each case listed in paragraphs (A) through (C) above, the reimbursement claim (Rückgriffsanspruch) by that company against the debtor of
the guaranteed claim may be freely set-off with a claim of such debtor against
that company;

(E) PLUS the equivalent of the aggregate amount of all Loans borrowed by any
Subsidiary of that company (downstream-guarantee) provided that the payment
by that company under the guarantee and indemnity pursuant to the respective
agreement is used for repayment of such Loans (including interest, default
interest and fees in connection therewith).

**_Austrian Banking Act_**

Credit institutions (Kreditinstitute) are defined in the section 1 para 1 of the Banking Act by setting out
a series of activities (including the issuance of guarantees) which, if conducted on a commercial basis,
are ‘banking activities’. Unless an exemption set forth by the Austria Banking Act or Austrian
regulator’s practice applies, only credit institutions (i) holding an Austrian banking license pursuant to
section 4 or section 103 of the Austrian Banking Act or (ii) authorized in another member state of the
European Economic Area and providing their services in relation to the activities referred to in no 1 to
no 15 of the annex I to the CRD IV either (i) through the establishment of a branch office or (ii) in
reliance upon the freedom to provide services may conduct such banking activities in Austria to the
extent they are covered by their existing banking license.

Any of the activities (including the issuance of guarantees) listed in section 1 para 1 of the Austrian
Banking Act (Bankwesengesetz) is conducted on a commercial basis (gewerbsmäßig) if such activity is
performed with the intention to generate income (Absicht der Einnahmenerzielung). The Austrian
Supreme Administrative Court takes a rather broad approach when evaluating an intention to generate
income that may already be present in a one-time transaction. The intention to make profits is not
required.

Conducting banking activities in Austria without the necessary license can trigger in particular
administrative fines and civil law sanctions. Section 98 para 1 of the Austrian Banking Act provides
that whoever carries out banking activities in Austria without the necessary license shall be punished
by the Austrian Financial Markets Authority (Finanzmarktaufsichtsbehörde) with a fine of up to euro 5
million or up to twice the amount of the benefit derived from the breach, to the extent that this can be
quantified, unless the act constitutes a criminal offence falling under the jurisdiction of the courts. In
case of a breach of the obligations pursuant to inter alia section 98 para 1 of the Austrian Banking Act,
the Austrian Financial Markets Authority may in addition impose fines on legal persons in the amount
of up to 10% of the total annual turnover or up to twice the amount of the benefit derived from the
breach, to the extent that this can be quantified. Furthermore, the law provides that whoever carries out
the banking activities unlicensed shall not be entitled to any compensation connected with such
activities (e.g., interests, commissions, fees, etc); sureties (Bürgschaften) and guarantees granted in
connection therewith are ineffective according to section 100 para 1 of the Austrian Banking Act.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognised under Austrian law and any
agreement or document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.

**Belgium**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

To the extent any Guarantor has its registered seat or principal establishment in Belgium (if the EU
Insolvency Regulation (Recast) is not applicable), or to the extent that Belgium is the territory in which
the center of a Guarantor’s main interests is situated (in each case, a “Belgian Guarantor”), main
insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Belgium. Such proceedings would then be governed by
Belgian law. In case the Guarantor has a branch in Belgium, Belgian law also allows bankruptcy
proceedings to be opened in Belgium over such branch’s assets that are located in Belgium. The
following is a brief description of certain aspects of Belgian insolvency law to the extent relevant in the
context of the present transaction.

Belgian insolvency laws provide for two main insolvency proceedings for enterprises: judicial
reorganization proceedings (gerechtelijke reorganisatie/réorganisation judiciaire) and bankruptcy
proceedings (faillissement/faillite).

##### 345


-----

Both types of insolvency proceedings are governed by Book XX “Insolvency of enterprises” of the
Belgian Code of Economic Law (the “Belgian Insolvency Act”).

Note that in addition, Belgian law allows for liquidation in deficit (deficitaire vereffening/liquidation
_déficitaire). The latter proceedings will not be further discussed._

**_Judicial Reorganization_**

A debtor (and in limited circumstances, its creditors, interested third parties or the public prosecutor)
may file a petition for judicial reorganization if the continuity of the enterprise is at risk, whether
immediately or in the future. If the net assets of the company have fallen under 50% of the company’s
registered capital (maatschappelijk kapitaal/capital social), the continuity of the enterprise is always
presumed to be at risk. A state of bankruptcy of the debtor does not exclude that a petition for judicial
reorganization is filed.

As from the filing of the petition and as long as the court overseeing a judicial reorganization has not
issued a ruling on the reorganization petition, the debtor cannot be declared bankrupt (save in case the
debtor files a declaration of bankruptcy itself) or wound up by court order. In addition, during the period
between the filing of the petition and the court’s decision, with few exceptions, none of the debtor’s
assets may be disposed of by any of its creditors as a result of the enforcement of any security interests
that such creditors may hold with respect to such assets.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides that, within a period of 15 days as from the filing of the petition,
the court will examine such petition, and within eight days following such examination and subject to
the satisfaction of the filing conditions, the court will declare the judicial reorganization procedure open,
allowing a temporary moratorium for a maximum period of six months. At the request of the debtor (or
of the judicial trustee in case of a procedure of transfer under judicial authority) and pursuant to the
report issued by the delegated judge, the moratorium period can thereafter be extended up to twelve
months as from the start of the moratorium period. In exceptional circumstances (such as due to the size
of the business, the complexity of the case or the impact of the procedure on employment), and in the
interest of the creditors, the court may order an additional extension of the moratorium period for six
months.

The granting of the moratorium operates as a stay. No enforcement measures with respect to preexisting claims in the moratorium can be continued or initiated against any of the debtor’s movable and
immovable assets from the time that the moratorium is granted until the end of the period, with few
exceptions. During the moratorium, no attachments can be made with regard to pre-existing claims.
During the moratorium, the debtor can also not be declared bankrupt, except upon declaration of the
debtor itself or for new debt arisen after the moratorium and, if the debtor is a legal entity, judicial
dissolution will not be possible during this period.

Conservatory attachments that existed prior to the opening of the judicial reorganization retain their
conservatory character, but the court may order their release, provided that such release does not have
a material adverse effect on the situation of the creditor concerned. If the date for the forced sale of
moveable or immovable property has already been set, such sale may, under certain conditions, be
continued.

If receivables are pledged by the debtor in favor of a creditor prior to the opening of the judicial
reorganization procedure, such pledge will not be affected by the moratorium, _provided that the_
receivables are pledged specifically to that creditor from the moment when the pledge is created. The
holder of such pledged receivables is permitted to take enforcement measures against the estate of the
initial counterparty of the debtor (such as the debtor’s customers) during the moratorium. A pledge on
financial instruments within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Act of December 15, 2004 (the
“Belgian Financial Collateral Act”), such as shares in the Belgian Guarantors, can be enforced
notwithstanding the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, subject to certain conditions.

##### 346


-----

In the case of a pledge on bank accounts, the enforcement prohibition applies, save in the event of
payment default. Personal guarantees granted by third parties in favor of the debtor’s creditors are not
covered by the enforcement prohibition imposed by the moratorium, nor are the debts payable by codebtors, subject to certain exceptions or qualifications in respect of guarantees granted by individuals.
The moratorium also does not prevent the voluntary payment by the debtor of claims covered by the
moratorium, to the extent such payment is necessary for the continuity of the enterprise.

During the judicial reorganization proceedings, the board of directors and management of the debtor
continue (in principle) to exercise their management functions, albeit under the limited supervision of
the court. However, upon request of the debtor, the court may appoint a judicial mediator
(ondernemingsbemiddelaar/médiateur d’entreprise) to facilitate the restructuring of all or part of its
assets or its activities. In addition, upon request of any interested party or the public prosecutor, the
court may appoint a judicial administrator (gerechtsmandataris/mandataire _de justice) in the event of_
manifestly grave shortcomings of the debtor or one of its corporate bodies threatening the continuity of
the debtor or its economic activities and provided such measure can preserve such continuity. As a
consequence of the COVID-19 crisis, the legislator has amended the law in such way that the same
measure can be requested by the debtor or in case the debtor can no longer be managed properly. In
principle and if not extended, this amendment applies only until 30 June 2021. Finally, in the event of
manifestly gross error of the debtors or one of its corporate bodies, the court can appoint a temporary
administrator (voorlopig bewindvoerder/ administrateur provisoire) at the request of any interested
party or the public prosecutor for the duration of the moratorium.

The reorganization procedure aims to preserve the continuity of a company as a going concern.
Consequently, the initiation of the procedure does not terminate any contracts, and contractual
provisions which provide for the early termination or acceleration of the contract upon the initiation or
approval of a reorganization procedure, and certain contractual terms such as default interest, may not
be enforceable during such a procedure. Save in the event of payment default, such enforcement
prohibition applies, with a few exceptions, to close-out netting provisions as well, if the judicial
reorganization procedure affects (i) a corporate debtor which is not a public or financial legal entity in
the meaning of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act or (ii) a public or financial legal entity where the
creditor is not such an entity. Moreover, the Belgian Insolvency Act provides that a creditor may not
terminate a contract on the basis of a debtor’s default that occurred prior to the reorganization procedure
if the debtor remedies such default within a 15-day period following the notification of such default
after granting of the moratorium.

As an exception to the general rule of continuity of contracts, the debtor may cease performing a
contract (other than labor contracts) during the reorganization proceedings, provided that the debtor
notifies the creditor and the decision is necessary for the debtor to be able to propose a reorganization
plan to its creditors or to transfer all or part of the company or its assets. The exercise of this right does
not prevent the creditor from suspending the performance of its own obligations. The creditor can
however not terminate the agreement solely on the ground that the debtor has suspended the
performance of its own obligations.

The Belgian Insolvency Act provides for three types of reorganization: (i) an amicable settlement
between the debtor and two or more of its creditors; (ii) a collective agreement; or (iii) the transfer of
(part of) the activities. The type of reorganization may change during the proceedings and may also
depend on the position of the court and/or third parties. It is also possible for the debtor to apply for a
“pre-pack” process aiming at testing in advance and under confidentiality the likelihood of an amicable
settlement or a collective agreement with the assistance of a judicial administrator; and during this
period the court may apply payment terms and/or payment conditions to creditors and/or freeze
enforcement measures for a maximum period of four months. The “pre-pack” process is part of a
temporary legislative arrangement (valid until 30 June 2021, but can be extended) until lawmakers
adopt a more thorough reform of the insolvency procedure, which is expected in view of transposing
the new EU directive on restructuring and insolvency.

##### 347


-----

In the case of an amicable settlement, only the parties to such amicable settlement will be bound by the
terms they have agreed. Such in-court agreement requires unanimity among the creditors concerned.
The debtor may petition the court to grant a grace period in respect of its payment obligations, e.g., in
relation to interest payments. Once agreement is reached, the court will record it. The court order
confirming the existence of an amicable settlement will be published, without disclosing the content of
the agreement, and its terms will only be binding upon the creditors that have agreed to it.

In the case of a judicial reorganization by collective agreement, the creditors agree to a reorganization
plan during the reorganization procedure. The plan may include measures such as the reduction or
rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations and the swap of debt into equity. The reorganization
plan must be filed with the online insolvency register (www.regsol.be) at least 20 days in advance of
the date on which the creditors will vote its approval. The court needs to ratify the reorganization plan
prior to it taking effect. A reorganization plan approved by a double majority of the creditors (both in
headcount and in value of the claims) and by the court will bind all creditors, including those who voted
against it or did not vote and whether secured or not, although only limited measures can be imposed
by such reorganization plan on secured creditors without their individual consent. The court may refuse
ratification if the formalities were not complied with, or if the proposed reorganization plan violates
public policy.

To enable the court to correctly invite all creditors to the vote, within a period of eight days following
the ruling declaring the judicial reorganization proceedings open, the debtor must inform each of its
creditors individually of the amount of their claims against the debtor as recorded in the books of the
debtor, as well as of details regarding security interests, if applicable. Creditors with pre-existing claims,
as well as any other interested party that claims to be a creditor, can challenge the amounts and the
ranking of the secured claims declared by the debtor. The court can determine the disputed amounts
and the ranking of such claims on a preliminary basis for the purpose of the reorganization procedure.
In addition, the court can at any moment, in case of absolute necessity and upon request by the debtor
or the creditor, change its decision determining the amount or the ranking of the claim on the basis of
new elements. If a creditor has not challenged the amount and the ranking of its claim at least one month
in advance of the date on which the creditors will vote on the approval of the reorganization plan, the
amount of its claim will remain unchanged for voting purposes as well as for the purposes of the
reorganization plan.

The debtor must use the moratorium period to complete and finalize a reorganization plan, with the
assistance of the court-appointed administrator, if applicable. The plan may include measures such as
the reduction or rescheduling of liabilities and interest obligations, the transfer of all or part of the
debtor’s business and the swap of debt into equity and may be based on a limited (justified)
differentiated treatment of certain various categories of liabilities.

The court-ordered transfer of all or part of the debtor’s enterprise can be requested by the debtor in its
petition or at a later stage in the procedure. It can be requested by the public prosecutor, by a creditor
or by any party who has an interest in acquiring, in whole or in part, the debtor’s enterprise, and the
court can order such transfer in specific circumstances.

The court-ordered transfer will be organized by a judicial administrator
(gerechtsmandataris/mandataire de justice) appointed by the court. Following the transfer, the recourse
of the creditors will be limited to the transfer price, subject to some limited exceptions.

**_Bankruptcy_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be initiated by the debtor, by unpaid creditors, upon the initiative of the
public prosecutor’s office, by the provisional administrator of the debtor’s assets, by the liquidator of
the debtor’s assets or by the liquidator of “main insolvency proceedings” opened in another EU Member
State (other than Denmark) in accordance with the EU Insolvency Regulation (Recast). Once the court

##### 348


-----

ascertains that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date by which all
creditors’ claims must be submitted to the court for verification.

Conditions for a bankruptcy order (faillietverklaring/déclaration de faillite) are that the debtor must be
in a situation of sustained cessation of payments (op duurzame wijze opgehouden hebben te
_betalen/cessation de paiements de manière persistante) and be unable to obtain further credit (wiens_
_krediet geschokt is/ébranlement de crédit). Cessation of payments is generally accepted to mean that_
the debtor is not able to pay its debts as they fall due. Such a situation must be persistent and not merely
temporary. In bankruptcy, the debtor loses all authority and decision rights concerning the management
of the bankrupt business. The bankruptcy receiver (curator/curateur), appointed by the court, becomes
responsible for the administering the bankruptcy and implements the sale of the debtor’s assets, the
distribution of the sale proceeds to creditors and the liquidation of the debtor. The rights of creditors in
the process are limited to being informed of the course of the bankruptcy proceedings on a regular basis
by the receiver. Creditors may oppose the sale of assets by bringing an action before the court if such
sale is detrimental to their rights. Any interested party may request the temporary continued operation
of the business if this is not detrimental to the creditors.

The receiver must decide whether or not to continue performance of ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts
existing before the bankruptcy order) or whether to terminate ongoing contracts unilateral if such
termination is required for administrating the bankrupt estate. Such decisions will not impair any rights
in rem of third parties that are enforceable against the estate. The other party to an ongoing contract
may demand the receiver to take a decision within fifteen days. If no extension of the 15 days term is
agreed upon or if the receiver does not take any decision, the ongoing contract is presumed to be
terminated after the expiration of the 15 days term. If the receiver decides not to continue performance
of an ongoing contract or if an ongoing contract is terminated due to the expiration of the fifteen days
term, the other party to the contract may be entitled to claim damages, for which claim he has to file a
debt claim in the bankruptcy.

The receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the receiver obtains the
authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However,
two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an_
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the
bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the
company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contract.

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of individual creditors are suspended upon the rendering of
the court order opening bankruptcy proceedings, and after such order is made, only the bankruptcy
trustee may proceed against the debtor and liquidate its assets. However, such suspension does not apply
to a pledge on financial instruments or cash held on account falling within the scope of the Belgian
Financial Collateral Act. Further exceptions exist with regard to estate debts (boedelschulden/dettes de
_la masse)._

For creditors with claims secured by movable assets, such suspension would normally be limited until
the filing of the first report of claims. At the request of the bankruptcy receiver, the suspension period
may be extended for up to one year from the bankruptcy judgment. Such extension requires a specific
order of the court which can only be made if the further suspension will allow for a realization of the
assets in the interest of all creditors without prejudicing the secured creditors and provided that those
secured creditors have been given the opportunity to be heard by the court.

##### 349


-----

For creditors with claims secured by immovable assets, the intervention of the bankruptcy receiver is
necessary to pursue the sale of the assets. The receiver will do so upon an order of the court, given either
at its request or at the request of a mortgagee. A first-ranking mortgagee will generally be entitled to
pursue the enforcement of its mortgage as soon as the first report of claims has been filed; the court
may suspend such enforcement for a period of not more than one year from the date of the bankruptcy
if the suspension will allow for a realization of the assets without prejudicing the mortgagee provided
that the mortgagee has been given the opportunity to be heard by the court. However, a pledge on
financial instruments or cash held on accounts can be enforced during the suspension period.

If a security interest, such as a pledge, has been granted over assets that, at the time of opening of an
insolvency proceeding, are located in another EU Member State, the rights the creditor has under such
security shall, in accordance with the Insolvency Regulation (Recast), not be affected by the opening of
such insolvency proceedings.

As from the date of the bankruptcy judgment, no further interest accrues against the bankrupt debtor on
its unsecured debt, or debts secured by a general privilege, like tax administration or social security.
The debts of the bankrupt estate generally will be ranked as to priority on the basis of complex rules.
The following is a general overview of only the main principles:

- Estate debt: Costs and indebtedness incurred by the receiver during the bankruptcy proceedings,
the so-called “estate debts,” have senior priority. In addition, if the receiver has contributed to
the realization and enforcement of secured assets, such costs will be paid to the receiver in
priority out of the proceeds of the realized assets before distributing the remainder to the secured
creditors.

- Security interests: Creditors that hold a security interest have a priority right over the secured
asset (whether by means of appropriation of the asset or on the proceeds upon realization).

- Privileges: Creditors may have a particular privilege on certain or all assets (such as tax claims,
claims for social security premiums, etc.). Privileges on specific assets rank before privileges
on all assets of the debtor. Certain privileges prevail over the security interests.

- Unsecured creditors (pari passu): Once all estate debts and creditors having the benefit of
security interests and privileges have been satisfied, the proceeds of the remaining assets will
be distributed by the receiver among the unsecured creditors (and secured/privileged creditors
if the security/privilege did not allow to be paid in full) who rank pari _passu (unless a creditor_
agreed to be subordinated).

- Subordinated creditors will receive the remainder (if any).

**_Hardening Period and Fraudulent Transfer_**

In the event of bankruptcy proceedings governed by Belgian law, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge
certain transactions that have been concluded or performed by the debtor during the so-called
“hardening period.”

In principle, the cessation of payments (which constitutes a condition to declare a debtor bankrupt) is
deemed to have occurred as of the date of the bankruptcy order. The court issuing the bankruptcy order
may determine, based on serious and objective indications, that the cessation of payments occurred on
an earlier date. Such earlier date may not be earlier than six months before the date of the bankruptcy
order, except in the case where the bankruptcy order relates to a company that was dissolved more than
six months before the date of the bankruptcy order in circumstances suggesting an intent to defraud its
creditors, in which case the date of cessation of payments may be determined to be the date of such
decision to dissolve the company. The period from the date of cessation of payments up to the
declaration of bankruptcy is referred to as the “hardening period” (verdachte periode/période suspecte).

##### 350


-----

The transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period which may be declared
ineffective against third parties include, among others, (i) gratuitous transactions or transactions entered
into at an undervalue, (ii) payments for debts which are not due, (iii) payments other than in cash for
debts due, and (iv) security interests provided for pre-existing debts (save for any security granted
during the suspension period of judicial reorganization proceedings).

Other transactions entered into or performed during the hardening period may be declared ineffective
against third parties provided that the counterparty was aware of the debtor’s cessation of payment.

In particular, a guarantee or security interest entered into during the hardening period may be declared
ineffective against third parties (i) if it is regarded as having been granted gratuitously, unbalanced or
at an undervalue, (ii) if the beneficiaries of the guarantee or security interests were aware of the Belgian
Guarantor’s cessation of payments or (iii) if it is granted to secure pre-existing debts.

If the Guarantee or security interests granted by the Belgian Guarantor were successfully voided (based
on the above), holders of the Notes would cease to have any claim in respect thereof and could be under
an obligation to repay any amounts received pursuant to such guarantee or the enforcement proceeds of
the security interests.

The bankruptcy receiver may also obtain a court ruling that a transaction or payment is not enforceable
against the bankrupt’s estate, regardless when such transaction or payment took place, if such
transaction or payment was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect the creditors’ rights.

Furthermore, even in the absence of bankruptcy proceedings, a third party creditor may obtain a court
ruling that an act or transaction (such as a guarantee) is not enforceable against it if it can establish that
the challenged act or transaction was effected with the fraudulent intent to adversely affect its position
as an existing creditor (actio pauliana).

Regardless of fraudulent intent, registration of a security interest after cessation of payments can also
be declared ineffective, when more than 15 days have passed in between the date of the deed and the
date of registration.

**_Note Guarantee/Collateral_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by a Belgian Guarantor for the obligations of another group
company must fall within the grantor’s legal and corporate purpose and be for the own corporate benefit
of the Belgian Guarantor and comply with any applicable financial assistance rules. Corporate benefit
is not a well-defined concept under Belgian law and its interpretation is left to the courts and legal
authors. The corporate benefit rules and their application in the context of granting guarantees or
collateral for the benefit of a group company are not clearly established under Belgian law and there is
only limited case law on this issue.

The question of corporate benefit must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the
prevailing factual circumstances. Consideration has to be given to any actual or real (be it direct and/or
indirect) benefit that the company would actually derive from the transaction and is particularly relevant
for upstream or cross-stream guarantees and security interests. It is generally taught by legal scholars
that such benefit should be proportionally greater than the risk for the company resulting from the
granting and/or enforcement of the guarantee concerned. The financial support granted by the company
should not exceed its financial capabilities. Belgian case law does not offer clear guidelines on when a
group transaction is within the individual group member’s corporate benefit and when aforementioned
conditions are met.

Whether or not the corporate benefit requirement is met is a matter of fact to be assessed by the board
of directors of the Belgian Guarantor. The corporate benefit justification by the company’s board of

##### 351


-----

directors will be subject to only a “marginal review” by the courts; in insolvency situations, however,
the courts can be expected to take a more critical view.

If the corporate benefit requirement is not met, the directors of the company may be held liable under
civil law (i) by the company for negligence in the management and (ii) by third parties in tort and under
criminal law in certain specific circumstances (i.e., where the specific facts can be qualified as “abuse
of company goods” (misbruik van vennootschapsgoederen/abus de bien sociaux)). Moreover, the
guarantee or security interest could be declared null and void and, under certain circumstances, the
creditor that benefits from the guarantee or security interest could be held liable if the corporate benefit
requirement is not met and the creditor knew or should have known this. Alternatively, the guarantee
or security interests could be reduced to an amount corresponding to the corporate benefit. These rules
have been seldom tested under Belgian law, and there is only limited case law on this issue.

In order to enable Belgian subsidiaries to grant a guarantee and security interest to secure liabilities of
a direct or indirect parent or sister company without the risk of violating Belgian rules on corporate
benefit, it is standard market practice for indentures, credit agreements, guarantees and security
documents to contain “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated or established in
Belgium. Accordingly, section 11.03 (Limitation of Liability of Belgian Guarantors) of the Indenture
contains such limitation language and the Guarantee of the Belgian Guarantor(s) will be limited
accordingly. Including such limitation language is, however, not conclusive in determining or
upholding the corporate benefit.

The grant of a guarantee or security interest by a Belgian company must also be within or serve the
corporate object and statutory object of the Belgian company as described in its articles of association,
and the guarantee or collateral may not include any liability that would result in unlawful financial
assistance in accordance with article 329 and 629 of the Belgian Companies Code dated 7 May 1999,
as amended or replaced from time to time, or Article 5:152 or 7:22 of the Belgian Code of Companies
and Associations dated 23 March 2019, as amended from time to time, whichever is applicable.

**_Role of the Security Agent_**

Belgian pledges over financial collateral (such as the shares of the Belgian Guarantor or bank accounts
of the Belgian Guarantor) or over movable assets (such as receivables of the Belgian Guarantor) have
been or will be granted to the Security Agent acting for itself and for the account of the secured parties
pursuant to Article 5 of the Belgian Financial Collateral Act, respectively Article 3 of the Belgian
Securities Act. These provisions allow for the creation of security held by an agent acting as
representative for secured parties, provided that the secured parties can be determined on the basis of
the security agreement.

**_Recognition and Enforcement_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be
subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render
such security interests invalid or unenforceable. The foreclosure of security interests may be subject to
formalities (e.g. judicial or non-judicial consent or, for movable assets (such as receivables), prior
notification to the debtor and certain interested parties) and may be time consuming in the event that
the foreclosure takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute, in which case any
interested party may request a judge at any moment in time to intervene, and such request would
suspend the foreclosure.

Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest and/or guarantee upon the evidence that the
creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the foreclosure of the security interest and/or
guarantee. Enforcement of security interests and/or guarantees may be hindered by conflict of law
and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and may not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory

##### 352


-----

legal provisions. Courts may require a sworn translation in French or Dutch of the English documents
which they may review.

**Denmark**

The below considerations in respect of Danish law only apply to Danish public limited liability
companies (aktieselskab or A/S) and private public limited liability companies (anpartsselskab or ApS)
such as the Danish Guarantors (unless otherwise stated).

Certain of the Guarantors are a company incorporated under the laws of Denmark. Any insolvency
proceedings with respect to a Danish Guarantor would be based on Danish insolvency laws. Please note
that the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply to Denmark. It should be noted that the Directive
(EU) 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, applies in Denmark
and is required to be implemented into Danish law. The final specific implementation and the date of
implementation have not yet been disclosed.

Danish insolvency laws may not be as favorable to investors’ interests as the laws of the United States
or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In the event that the Danish Guarantor
experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty an outcome of insolvency or
similar proceedings. There are two kinds of Danish in-court insolvency proceedings; bankruptcy and
in-court restructuring.

**_Bankruptcy Proceedings_**

Bankruptcy proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of a debtor or a creditor, however
provided that the debtor is insolvent, which pursuant to the Danish Insolvency Act is defined as the
debtor’s inability to pay his debts as they fall due, unless such inability is considered to be temporary.

The petition for bankruptcy must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which the debtor
operates his business. The bankruptcy court does not publish information on the receipt of the petition
for bankruptcy, but any person having a legal interest is entitled to receive information as to whether
and when a debtor has filed a petition for bankruptcy (debtor’s own petition). The bankruptcy court
does not provide information on a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy.

A creditor cannot demand that the debtor be declared bankrupt if the creditor’s claim is secured by
adequate security. In this context, adequate security means a security right expected to provide full
coverage for the creditor. If the security is voidable in bankruptcy or the act of perfection has not been
performed, the creditor does not have adequate security.

The creditor is not required to have a basis of execution for his claim, e.g., a judgment in a civil case, a
settlement in-court or a signed debt instrument or mortgage. Further, the creditor’s claim does not have
to be due for payment to form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. However, the creditor must have a
legal interest in the debtor’s estate being administered in bankruptcy. As a result, not all claims that
have not become due for payment may form basis of a petition for bankruptcy. Depending on the
circumstances, an overdraft facility still being in force or a repayment arrangement being observed by
the debtor may result in the creditor’s petition being rejected. The requirement for legal interest also
means that in general the bankruptcy court will reject a creditor’s petition for bankruptcy if it is clear in
advance that he will not receive any dividend in case of bankruptcy. It should be noted, however, that
if there is probable cause to believe that the debtor has made avoidable transactions, the creditor may
have the required legal interest in the bankruptcy even if the debtor does not have substantial assets. In
that case, the creditor must be able to substantiate the avoidable transactions with some degree of
certainty.

##### 353


-----

A creditor having filed a petition for bankruptcy against a debtor will be liable to pay damages if the
debtor suffers a loss or to pay compensation for injury to the debtor’s reputation if the bankruptcy
conditions, the insolvency requirement, are not fulfilled or if the claim does not exist.

The petitioner must provide security for the expenses relating to the administration of the estate. In
practice, the bankruptcy court demands security in the amount of DKK 30,000 (DKK 40,000 if subject
to the jurisdiction of the Commercial and Maritime Court). If the debtor has filed the petition for
bankruptcy, the security must be provided by the funds of the bankruptcy estate.

**_Bankruptcy Trustee_**

One or more trustees are appointed at the discretion of the bankruptcy court; however, in practice the
request of the major unsecured and unsubordinated creditors have the decisive influence as another
trustee can be appointed at a creditor’s meeting.

The trustee is not required to be an attorney, but in practice that is always the case.

The trustee must comply with the disqualification rules of the Danish Insolvency Act. Consequently,
the trustee must not be the debtor’s related party or depending on the debtor, and there must not be any
doubt as to whether the trustee is impartial. As a general rule, the debtor’s own attorney is prevented
from being appointed as trustee due to the disqualification rules. The bankruptcy court may also find
that a person being a member of the board of directors of the debtor’s business or a person being the
debtor’s advisor cannot be appointed as trustee. Likewise, any person whom the bankruptcy estate is
expected to make claims against, e.g., an avoidance claim or otherwise, will most likely be deemed to
have a personal interest in the administration of the estate and would therefore not meet these
requirements.

The trustee will make all decisions concerning the administration of the bankruptcy estate, and he
represents the estate in every respect. The bankruptcy court supervises the trustee but is not involved in
the actual administration of the estate.

**_In-Court Restructuring_**

In-court restructuring proceedings may be commenced either at the petition of the debtor or a creditor.
The petition for in-court restructuring must be filed with the bankruptcy court in the district in which
the debtor operates his business.

In-court restructuring proceedings may only be commenced if the debtor is insolvent (same as described
above with respect to bankruptcy). If this criterion is fulfilled, the bankruptcy court will immediately
appoint a restructuring administrator and a restructuring accountant to oversee the restructuring of the
company. The management continues to operate the company, but any material transactions may not
be carried out without the prior approval of the restructuring administrator. Payment of creditors may
only be done in accordance with the priority of claims as described below.

The in-court restructuring of a company must achieve one or more of the following statutory objectives:
(1) the in-court restructuring of the business by means of a compulsory composition; (2) the termination
of the business of the company by transferring the business; or (3) any combination of (1) and (2). The
aim of a restructuring is therefore to salvage the business itself, but not necessarily thereby saving the
company.

The restructuring administrator will propose a restructuring plan, and creditors with a legal interest who
attend the voting meeting at the court can vote for or against the proposed restructuring plan.

If the in-court restructuring does not contain at least one of these required elements, the in-court
restructuring will automatically seize and, provided the company is still insolvent, bankruptcy
proceedings shall be initiated.

##### 354


-----

**_Liquidation_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of the company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to the creditors and, providing all creditors have been paid in full, the
shareholders. In Denmark, liquidation is not an insolvency proceeding, and only companies that are
solvent can be liquidated. If a company is insolvent, or if it turns out during the liquidation process that
the company cannot pay all its creditors in full, the company must enter bankruptcy proceedings instead.
The decision to liquidate a company is made by the shareholders of the company at a general meeting
who also appoint a liquidator. At the end of the liquidation process the company will be dissolved.

**_Certain Avoidance Rules and Hardening Periods_**

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, the bankruptcy estate is under certain circumstances entitled to avoid
the debtor’s transactions in a reference period preceding the bankruptcy if such transactions have
reduced the assets of the estate or otherwise damaged the estate, or if the transactions have favoured
certain creditors without observing the ranking of the creditors.

Transactions damaging the estate are for example gifts (including sale of assets at undervalue),
renunciations of inheritance or the payment of excessive salary or pension to related parties.
Transactions favoring creditors without observing the ranking of creditors are for example payment by
unusual means of payment, payments before due date, payments having significantly impaired the
debtor’s ability to pay or the provision of security for prior debts. Special attention is given to the
avoidance rule on security for prior debts and the general avoidance rule in the following paragraphs.

Any security interest created and perfected within a three-month reference period prior to the
bankruptcy and which has not been created prior to, or simultaneously with, the debt obligations which
it secures, or which is not perfected without undue delay after the creation of such debt obligations may
be subject to an avoidance claim from the estate.

Danish insolvency law operates with a general avoidance rule, which stipulates that an action which
unduly benefits a single creditor to the detriment of the other creditors, or whereby the company’s assets
are prevented from serving the purpose of satisfying the creditors, or whereby the company’s debt is
increased to the detriment of the creditors, may be declared void if the company was or because of the
action became insolvent, and the benefitted party knew or ought to have known about the company’s
insolvency and the circumstances that made the action improper. Generally, only transactions which
are contrary to common norms of correct and decent business behavior will be deemed improper.
Improper behavior is normally related to a breach of the purpose of insolvency proceedings, which
typically is the situation where a creditor should have realized that a given transaction would deprive
the other creditors of their right to fulfilment of their claims.

The usual reference period is three months prior to the filing date, which is extended to up to 24 months
for transactions with parties closely related to the company, and the general avoidance rule (as described
above) provides for a theoretically unlimited avoidance period with respect to improper transactions.
The requirement that the company must have been in an uninterrupted insolvent state throughout the
entire period does, however, limit the practical length of the reference period.

**_Legal Position of Unsecured Claims and Priority of Claims_**

Creditors believing to have a claim against the debtor or the bankruptcy estate must prove their claims
and accompany their proofs of claim by adequate documentation. The trustee registers all claims and
examines whether they are legitimate and entitle the creditor to receive dividend.

##### 355


-----

The ranking of creditors is described in the Danish Insolvency Act which determines the order in which
claims against the estate or the debtor are settled. All higher-ranking claims must be satisfied in full
before the next level will be entitled to dividend, i.e., a water fall scheme. The ranking of creditors is as
follows:

- Firstly: costs or claims incurred in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings or claims
according to agreements upheld by the estate;

- Secondly: reasonable claims in connection with any prior attempted restructuring proceedings;

- Thirdly: claims for wages or salaries payable;

- Fourthly: claims of suppliers for certain indirect taxes;

- Fifthly: unsecured claims (all other claims except for deferred claims); and

- Sixthly: deferred claims (interest, fines, promises of gifts and subordinate loan capital).

Secured claims are handled separately from the water fall and the secured claim is paid using the
proceeds from the collateral that secures the claim. If the secured claim is not covered by the proceeds,
the outstanding part of the secured claim will generally be considered as a regular unsecured claim in
the water fall. The handling of secured claims will in each case depend on the type of security.

**_Limitation on Enforcement_**

The Danish Companies Act (selskabsloven) contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish
limited liability companies. Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries can, directly or indirectly,
advance funds, grant loans or provide guarantee and/or security in respect of obligations of amongst
others, their direct and indirect parent companies. If the relevant shareholder is not a limited liability
company incorporated in a jurisdiction which is a member of the EU or European Economic Area or
Switzerland, Australia, Canada, Chile, Great Britain, Japan, Northern Ireland, Israel, South Korea, New
Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan or U.S., then the following special requirements apply to such financial
assistance:

(i) the financial assistance is within the distributable reserves and made on ordinary market terms
(on an arm’s-length basis),

(ii) the financial assistance must be approved by the shareholders/at a shareholders meeting and
cannot exceed such approved amount and

(iii) the financial assistance can only be made after the first annual account.

As a general rule, Danish companies and their foreign subsidiaries are prohibited from granting loans
and or guarantees or security in connection with the financing or refinancing of the direct or indirect
acquisition of their own shares or shares in their direct or indirect parent companies and any such loan,
guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

It is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider obtains an adequate corporate
benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or the granting of security. This is due to a requirement under
Danish law that the management of a company must always ensure a proper management of the
company’s assets.

Further, the management board and the board of directors of the company is obliged to act in accordance
with the company’s individual interests, including consideration of the company’s financial position,
the benefits the company will obtain through and the risks related to the granting of security, assessment

##### 356


-----

of the debtor, securing that the arrangement is on market terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained,
among others, the guarantee or security interest may be null and void. It is not clear under Danish case
law to what extent such corporate benefit is established when a subsidiary guarantees and/or secures
debt of a direct or indirect parent company.

**_Contractual Limitations of Guarantees and Security Granted by Guarantors Incorporated in_**
**_Denmark_**

To mitigate the above-mentioned financial assistance and corporate benefit issues, a guarantee granted
by a Danish Guarantor (and any subsidiary of a Danish Guarantor to the extent liable) as well as any
security created in relation thereto by any such Danish Guarantor (or any Subsidiary of a Danish
Guarantor) will be limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions on
unlawful financial assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation,
Sections 206 through 212 of the Danish Companies Act. In addition, a guarantee and security interest
granted by a Danish Guarantor may further be limited to a maximum amount equivalent to the higher
of the equity (egenkapital) of such guarantor (calculated in accordance with the approved accounting
principles) at the time of the granting of the guarantee or the relevant security, or at the time payment
is requested pursuant to the guarantee or at the time of enforcement of the relevant security.

Consequently, any guarantees and security interests provided by any Danish Guarantor will be subject
to restrictions and limitations, which may limit the value of a Guarantee issued by such Danish
Guarantor and security interest to avoid a breach of the corporate benefit requirement and to ensure
compliance with applicable restrictions on financial assistance.

The above contractual limitations will apply mutatis mutandis to any subordination of rights and claims,
subordination or turn-over of rights of recourse, application of proceeds, set-offs and any other mean of
direct or indirect financial assistance made by a Danish Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.

**_Ownership_**

Danish law does not make any distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such
distinction is made under foreign law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.

**_Statutes of Limitation_**

Claims may become barred under Danish statutes of limitation or principles of passivity or may become
subject to set-off or counterclaim and a guarantee in favor of a Danish credit institution may not be
enforceable unless a claim has been made under the guarantee within six months after the due date of
the guaranteed obligation.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under the Danish Insolvency Act, claims against the estate must be converted into DKK at the exchange
rate at the day the bankruptcy court issued a bankruptcy order against the company.

**_Enforcement of Security Interests Outside Bankruptcy_**

The parties to a security agreement can include contractually agreed enforcement procedures and, if
there are no bankruptcy proceedings, the agreed procedures will be binding on the parties. However, a
sale of assets may be voidable in a later bankruptcy proceeding if the assets were transferred below
market value or if the sale unduly benefits a creditor to the detriment of other creditors.

The agreed enforcement procedures are not binding on third-parties such as creditors that have
registered an attachment or valid security against the encumbered assets.

Such third-party attachments and rights can only be cleared through a court administered public auction.

##### 357


-----

In the absence of specifically agreed enforcement procedures, Danish law requires conduct of a public
auction in accordance with the Danish Administration of Justice Act (retsplejeloven).

Pledges of shares and accounts as well as security assignments of receivables may be enforced without
an execution order. However, at least one week’s prior notice requesting the debtor to pay the secured
debt must be given to the pledgor in respect of share pledge and account pledge by registered mail
unless a sale is necessary to avoid or reduce a loss. The pre-enforcement notice period can be waived
in respect of certain financial collateral arrangements.

**_Perfection of Security Interests_**

The Collateral governed by Danish law will be granted and perfected, inter alia, in favor of the holders
of Notes represented by the Security Agent. Rules have been enacted in the Danish Capital Markets Act
(kapitalmarkedsloven) allowing representatives to hold security on behalf of holders of Notes and the
Security Agent may be appointed as representative pursuant to the Danish Capital Markets Act as set
out in further detail below. There is not yet any case law relating to this legislation confirming the right
of the representative to enforce on behalf of holders of Notes so there is a risk that enforcement may be
delayed. Absent perfection of the security interest or absent registration of the Security Agent with the
Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), the holder of the security interest may not be
able to enforce its rights in Danish collateral against third-parties, including a bankruptcy administrator
and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. Moreover, if perfection occurs
only after the occurrence of certain events of default it will entail a hardening period (as described
above).

The perfection requirements for the security over shares to be granted in favor of the holders of the
Notes will be set out in the relevant security document, and these entail a notification to the issuer of
the shares subject to the security and the recording of the security in the shareholders’ register of the
entity subject to the security. Under Danish law, the ranking of security rights is determined by the date
on which the relevant act of perfection has been taken, and if a security interest created later in time
over that same collateral, but in respect of which the act of perfection is completed prior to perfection
of the pre-existing security interest then the security interest created later will have priority.

**_The Security Agent and the Trustee_**

The ability of the Security Agent to hold the relevant security interests over the Danish Collateral on
behalf of holders of Notes pursuant to any security document governed by Danish law as well as the
ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of holders of the Notes may require registration of
the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet).
The registration of the Security Agent as holder of Collateral with the Danish Financial Supervisory
Authority (Finanstilsynet) is, however, not a legal validity requirement for the granting and perfection
of collateral.

Under Danish law it is uncertain (i) whether the appointment of the Trustee and the Security Agent to
represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes would be binding in the event of the bankruptcy of
a holder of Notes; (ii) whether the Trustee and the Security Agent have and will maintain the capacity
to bring proceedings and legal interest in the name or on behalf of the holders of Notes in the event of
bankruptcy of a holder of Notes; (iii) whether the security and guarantees can be validly granted in favor
of the Security Agent as agent and representative on behalf of the holders of Notes; and (iv) whether
the holders of Notes can validly waive their rights to exercise their powers independently. As regards
the Notes, a Guarantee issued by a Danish Guarantor and any security document expressed to be
governed by Danish law, the above concerns regarding the ability of the Security Agent to hold a
guarantee and the relevant security interests over collateral on behalf of the holders of the Notes and
the ability of the Trustee to represent and act on behalf of the holders of Notes can be addressed by
registering the Security Agent and the Trustee with the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority
(Finanstilsynet) in accordance with the rules set out in Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act.

##### 358


-----

No assurance is given that the Security Agent, the Trustee or the Indenture and other documents meet
the eligibility criteria for the Security Agent and/or the Trustee to be registered with the Danish
Financial Supervisory Authority (Finanstilsynet), that such registration will be obtained or, if obtained,
that it will be maintained.

**_Parallel Debt_**

There is no established concept of “trust,” “trustee” or “parallel debt” under Danish Law and as such
these concepts may not be recognized or enforced by Danish courts. Danish law does not make any
distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such distinction is made under foreign
law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Danish law.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales (the “English Guarantors”).

**_Applicable Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts_**

While the United Kingdom was a member state of the European Union, insolvency processes opened
in the United Kingdom were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the
United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on 31 January 2020 and the expiry of the
subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31 December 2020, in accordance with the
European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement)
Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the United Kingdom at the end of the Transition Period
(subject to certain exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments.
The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key
amendments to both EU insolvency laws previously directly applicable in the UK, including the
Insolvency Regulation 2000 and the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the
“Recast Insolvency Regulation”), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986
(the “Insolvency Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the
“Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “CrossBorder Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU
insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English
Guarantors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the
time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Guarantor
has its COMI in a member state of the European Union, insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the
Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member
state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, pursuant to the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations, certain foreign courts may have jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings
of any English Guarantor which has its COMI or an “establishment” (being a place of operations where
it carries out a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets or services) in such
foreign jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency
proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the United Kingdom or which has its
COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the United Kingdom.
An “establishment” is defined to mean any place of operations where the company carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a nontransitory economic activity with human means and assets. While this allows English courts to assume
jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of
such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of

##### 359


-----

such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions (see “Cross-border Recognition of English Insolvency
and Restructuring Proceedings” below).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Guarantor experiences financial difficulty, it is
not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations
under the Notes are guaranteed by the Note Guarantees and secured by security interests over the
Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment
obligations of the Issuers in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Issuer, of
a Note Guarantee against an English Guarantor and of the security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such
limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their
rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by any of the Issuers, under the
Note Guarantees and/or under the Collateral securing the Notes and the Note Guarantees and therefore
may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Guarantor.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over certain
Collateral owned by the English Guarantors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallizes, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to
floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively
disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating
charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating
charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the
floating charge has not crystallized at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no
restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general
costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency officeholders and the costs of continuing
to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an
insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets
(including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency officeholders appointed to a
charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general
costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of
the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full; (c)
an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without
the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same
priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d)
where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement”
(generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market
debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations
2003 (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security
are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for
unsecured creditors (see “Priority on Insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency
“clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security. Only with prior approval of the court can an
administrator deal with property subject to a fixed charge provided that disposing of the property is
likely to promote the administration’s purpose and that the administrator apply the gross proceeds from
the disposal of the property in question towards discharging the obligations of the company to the charge
holder.

##### 360


-----

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to
be created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as
the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterized as floating security
interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of
control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof
and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging
company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion
and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in
question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests: (a) the proceeds of those
assets could be applied in meeting other liabilities of the company in priority to the claims of the
purported fixed charge holder in insolvency proceedings and (b) it is possible that any purported floating
charge security may no longer relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the
relevant company and therefore may not constitute a “qualifying floating charge.” See also “—
_Administrative Receivership.”_

**_Administration_**

Under the Insolvency Act, as amended, administration proceedings are available in respect of any
company incorporated in England, Wales, Scotland or a member state of the EEA, any company
(irrespective of its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the United Kingdom or an EU member
state (other than Denmark) and upon request from courts in other parts of the United Kingdom or certain
other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order
can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to
pay its debts” and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of
administration.

A company is unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as
they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less
than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), as per
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. Such insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company
fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service
or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order).

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three parts that must be looked at successively to
determine whether it is reasonable to put the company into administration: rescuing the company as a
going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s
creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives
is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed
thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The
order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “Priority on
_Insolvency” below). An administrator must attempt to achieve the objectives of administration in order,_
unless he thinks it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the primary objective, or that the secondary
objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot
pursue the third objective unless he thinks either the first or the second objective is unachievable and
that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the
third objective.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such
company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “Qualifying Floating Charge”
below) where the floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of
court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor.

##### 361


-----

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business as an agent of the company to which
they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property
of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the
proceeds of the realization of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for
satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see
“Prescribed Part” below). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets
subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the
administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder.

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration.
Upon the appointment of an administrator, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be
taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the
administrator or leave of the court (although a demand for payment could be made under a guarantee
granted by the company). The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or
continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the
company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in
determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration
described above.

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be
able to realize their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory
moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest
created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash
or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit
claims) under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

Accordingly, if any of the English Guarantors were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Note
Guarantees and the Collateral may not be enforceable without the permission of the court or consent of
the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the
Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying Floating Charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of
English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see
“Administration” above) or (in limited circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “Administrative
_Receivership” below). The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of_
an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to
either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the
proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of
appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into
administration.

A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a)
states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it, (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint
an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative
receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of
a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of
security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the
relevant company, and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that
it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the whole or substantially the
whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of a
company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

##### 362


-----

**_Administrative Receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in
very limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of
a qualifying floating charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates 15
September 2003 or where it falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended
by the Enterprise Act 2002). The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in the
Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for
the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue
of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or
traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court
procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “Transactions
_at an Undervalue”, “Preference” and “Voidable Floating Charge” below, respectively). If an_
administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Fixed Charge Receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain
floating charges, see “Administrative Receivership” above) may be appointed over some or all of the
assets secured by a fixed charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed
charge or (in limited circumstances) pursuant to statute.

If appointed under the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand
made for an appointment to take place. A fixed charge receiver can be appointed in parallel to a
liquidator. An administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge
receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral
arrangement”, as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “Administration”
above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realize the assets over which (s)he is appointed,
meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor. This contrasts with the duty of an
administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other
words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realizing the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price
obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory
indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realizations made of the assets of the company (and may
also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallized floating charge, amounts will be
deducted from the proceeds of the realization of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any
preferential creditors (see “Prescribed Part” below).

**_Scheme of Arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English
courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company’s
liabilities between a company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). An English Guarantor may
be able to pursue a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Guarantor which
(a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England

##### 363


-----

and Wales could also pursue a scheme, provided it can be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the
scheme of arrangement would be recognized in the jurisdictions in which the company has its main
assets or operations. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the
second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in
England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance
documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law.
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will
not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the
present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of
classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any
new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the
company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors
present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed scheme,
irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme
will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected
creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then
needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the
scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the
scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Restructuring Plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under Part 26A of the Companies Act
2006 which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its creditors (or any class of its creditors). While generally available to the same domestic
and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan
process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are
affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise
or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors (or any class of them) whose
purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor of the company or any
liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected
creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single
class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the
proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring
plan.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors present and
voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors vote in favor of the proposed compromise, there
is no requirement for the approving creditors to constitute a majority in number of those creditors
present and voting, and there is crucially no requirement for each and every voting class to approve of
the plan, provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be
any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the
‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors who
would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the
‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court
considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not
sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of

##### 364


-----

a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more
classes of affected creditors do not vote in favor of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote
of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the meetings of creditors subject to the terms of the plan,
the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will
review whether each applicable statutory condition has been satisfied and may decline to sanction the
restructuring plan if it does not consider that it would be just and equitable to do so. The court has
discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan as approved, make an order conditional upon
modifications being made or reject the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds
all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective
(in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to
the Registrar of Companies.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not
automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Liquidation/Winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency
Act (see “Priority on Insolvency” below). There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory
liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary
liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members. The difference between the two
voluntary proceedings is the solvency of the company in question; in a members’ voluntary liquidation,
the directors of the company swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the
following 12 months whereas the primary ground for a creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent
company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act, see
“Administration” above). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from
administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process
is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. Whereas compulsory liquidation and creditors’
voluntary liquidation proceedings are available to foreign companies with sufficient nexus to the United
Kingdom in addition to companies within the English courts’ general jurisdiction (see “Applicable
_Legal Framework and Jurisdiction of the English Courts” above), members’ voluntary liquidation_
proceedings are only available to companies registered in England, Wales or Scotland.

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant
company’s property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created
or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral
Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms.
Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it
is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a
winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed.
No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of
the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the
enforcement of security.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of
a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result,
there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case
of a voluntary winding-up – it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to
apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security.

##### 365


-----

A liquidator has the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on
the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s
property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions
(see “Avoidance of Transactions” below).

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislation has been introduced which temporarily restricts the
ability of creditors to present winding-up petitions and of courts to grant winding-up orders. While these
measures remain in place, (a) winding-up petitions on the basis of a company’s inability to satisfy a
statutory demands alone are void if the relevant statutory demands were served between 1 March 2020
and 30 September 2021, and (b) where winding-up petitions are presented between 1 March 2020 and
30 September 2021 based on other grounds, the petitioning creditor must show that it had reasonable
grounds to believe that coronavirus has not had a financial effect on the company or that the company’s
inability to pay its debts would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect on the company.
Between 1 March 2020 and 30 September 2021, a court may similarly only grant a winding-up order in
circumstances where a company is deemed unable to pay its debts and it appears to the court that
coronavirus has had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition if the court
is satisfied that the company’s insolvency would have arisen even if coronavirus had not had such effect
on the company.

**_Priority on Insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of liquidation (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of
the company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

In accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in
descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in
a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts
due to each creditor within a class.

Contractual setting-off arrangements entered into after a company enters liquidation or administration
are only respected to the extent they fall within the definition of “mutual dealing” as applied by the
mandatory insolvency set-off regime. This regime sees an account being taken of what is due from each
party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and only the resulting net balance is either provable
by the creditor in the administration or liquidation of the company (if amounts remain due to the
creditor) or, conversely, is payable by the creditor to the company (if amounts remain due to the
company).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

- _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security and creditors with a proprietary interest in_
specific assets in possession of the debtor (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets
covers that indebtedness);

- _Second ranking: prescribed fees and expenses of the official receiver;_

- _Third ranking: where winding-up procedures are begun within 12 weeks following the end of_
any (new, stand-alone) moratorium (see further below), unpaid moratorium debts and unpaid
priority pre-moratorium debts;

- _Fourth ranking:_ expenses of the insolvent estate incurred during the relevant insolvency
proceedings (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses
are-paid);

##### 366


-----

- _Fifth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per
person; (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible
for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory
limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally.

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax (including
student loan repayments), employee NI contributions and Construction Industry Scheme deductions
(but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions) which are held by the company on behalf
of employees and customers as well as bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
FSCS to the extent such claims exceed the statutory limit. As between one another, secondary
preferential debts rank equally;

- _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security._
This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document
that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge.
However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed
Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to
unsecured creditors;

- _Fifth Seventh ranking:_

- firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall)
secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the
date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. To pay the secured creditors
any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured
assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless
the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

- secondly, interest on the company’s debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and
the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in
respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation or after the commencement of an
administration which has been converted into a distributing administration. However, in the
case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Note Guarantees, such interest
due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets,
be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

- thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully
paid. This however does not include “currency conversion” claims following the UK Supreme
Court decision in Re: Lehman Brothers International Europe dated 17 May 2017; and

- _Eighth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any_
remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

##### 367


-----

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator)
will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential
creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence
applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s floating charge realization and (b) 20% of the
remainder over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net
property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before 6
April 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made
available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting
benefit to creditors.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their
debts, the office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling
at a single rate for each currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates
prevailing on the relevant date. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. If a creditor
considers the rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into
liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Notes may become
entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Avoidance of Transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of
security and/or guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the company is placed
into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the granting of the security and/or
guarantee. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an
English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee
given by such company.

The Issuers cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency (as
described below) is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or
guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction
as valid.

_Onset of Insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and
invalid floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or
(c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory
liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in
a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial
administration.

##### 368


-----

_Connected Persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by
the company with a “connected person”, then particular specified time periods and presumptions will
apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of
the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an
associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of
a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they
are employed by that company. A company is associated with another company if the same person has
control of both companies, or a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and
persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or if a group of two or more persons has
control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as
consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced
by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting
power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where
two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control
of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest
or guarantee granted by the English Guarantors include, without limitation, the following described
below:

_Transactions at an Undervalue_

Under Section 238 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an
order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where the
creation of such security interest or guarantee constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a
consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its
debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the onset
of the company’s insolvency is within a period of two years from the date the company grants the
security interest or the guarantee. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show
that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person (see “Connected Persons” above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the
connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the
transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person,
if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less
value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court
shall not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and
for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds
for believing the transaction would benefit it.

##### 369


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such
order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into
the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or
guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or
impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company
entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was
acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction
in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where
the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

Under Section 239 of the Insolvency Act, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an
order to set aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or grant other relief) where
such payment, creation of security interest or guarantee constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the
transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in
Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into
insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a
connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary
is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company
grants the security interest or the guarantee. A transaction may constitute a preference if a transaction
has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s
debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation)
than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that transaction not been
entered into. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the
transaction was influenced by a desire to produce a preferential position in relation to that person when
taking their decision.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay
its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however,
the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected
person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to
put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact,
no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees
fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction,
which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An
order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person
whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good
faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person
who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or
administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that
person at a time when they were a creditor of the company.

_Transactions Defrauding Creditors_

Under Section 423 of the Insolvency Act, where it can be shown that a transaction was at an undervalue
and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose of putting assets beyond the reach
of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise
prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make,

##### 370


-----

the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may
be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial
Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in
liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or
administrators. There is no statutory time limit within which the challenge must be made (subject to the
normal statutory limitation periods) and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time
of, or as a result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make
such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been
entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing
payments due under or setting aside security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect
the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom
the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to
the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. The
court can review extortionate credit transactions up to three years before the day on which the company
entered into administration or went into liquidation. A credit transaction is “extortionate” if, having
regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, the terms of it are (or were) such as to
require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies)
in respect of the provision of the credit or it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair
dealing.

_Voidable Floating Charges_

Under Section 245, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the onset
of the company’s insolvency (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favor of a connected
person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a
consequence of the transaction will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid
to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant
company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the
“Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting
the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the
floating charge is granted to a connected person.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that
a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time
period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration, irrespective of
whether the relevant company is solvent or insolvent at the time of grant.

However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to
challenge as described in “Administration” above.

_Recharacterization of Fixed Charges_

As referred to above (see “Fixed Versus Floating Charges” above), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterized as a floating charge. If such recharacterisation falls within the suspect period referred
to above (see “Voidable Floating Charges” above), this could render the charge invalid except to the
value of the Consideration.

##### 371


-----

_Disclaimer_

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract
or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay
money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A
contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial
obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable
merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could
make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed
contract nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any
liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

**_Limitations on Enforcement_**

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a Note Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Guarantors in respect of the
obligations of another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other
requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and
articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk
that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective
creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with
an English Guarantor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Guarantor in question with respect to its
entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director
must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the
company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there
is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and
such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies
Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in
the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when
directors’ duties to creditors arise, the English courts have held that the shift takes place when the
directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with
“likely” in this context meaning “probable.”

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Guarantor may also be subject to potential limitations
to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security Registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including
security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant
security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date
of creation of the relevant security interest (the “Registration Period”). In light of the COVID-19
pandemic, the Registration Period has temporarily been extended to 31 days for security interests
granted between June 6, 2020 and April 5, 2021 (unless extended further). While the Companies Act
2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security, security will be
deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging
company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt
which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited
circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register
and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired.

##### 372


-----

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration
with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and
Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration
with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including
creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights
and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing
administration (see “Administration” above), moratoriums are also available to companies entering
liquidation (see “Liquidation/Winding-up” above).

_Restriction on the Operation and Exercise of Ipso Facto Provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso
facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies
undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods
or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action,
or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event,
upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the
trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration,
administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation and/or a restructuring plan),
such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless
the company or the relevant officeholder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on
the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in
the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or
guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which
are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the
Insolvency Act). In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain small suppliers are also temporarily
excluded from the restrictions where the counterparty enters into relevant insolvency procedures prior
to 30 September 2021 (unless extended further).

**_Cross-Border Recognition of English Insolvency and Restructuring Proceedings_**

_General Position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed
by applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction,
proceedings and judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and
conflicts of laws rules applicable in the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency
(the “Model Law”), which has been adopted in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States
and the United Kingdom, where it was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The
Model Law provides for recognition of certain UK insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as
either foreign main proceedings (if COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in the United
Kingdom) or foreign non-main proceedings (if COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the
debtor has an establishment in the United Kingdom). The Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations only
provide for recognition of proceedings under British insolvency law, which in relation to England and
Wales covers proceedings initiated under the Insolvency Act other than receivership proceedings and
members’ voluntary liquidations, and does not extend to restructuring processes governed by corporate
law such as schemes of arrangement and restructuring plan processes.

##### 373


-----

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement and
restructuring plan processes, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject
to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the
enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005
and the Lugano Convention 2007 (subject to the United Kingdom’s pending accession to the latter)
where these apply.

_Recognition in the European Union_

Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union and the expiry of the Transition
Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member
states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom
do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures
across the European Union (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the United Kingdom and one or more EU member states will be subject to a
degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more
problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in EU member states
and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. The general
position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules
adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings,
increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK
office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less
certain that such appointment will be recognized in other EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the United
Kingdom was a member state of the European Union. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and
to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may adversely affected as a result.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Security Provider is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and is in
principle also subject to Luxembourg insolvency laws. The following is a brief description of certain
aspects of Luxembourg insolvency laws.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency
proceedings”) may be commenced against a company with a registered office in the Grand Duchy
Luxembourg having its COMI in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg or an “establishment” in
Luxembourg within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary
proceedings):

- insolvency proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by
any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may commence
insolvency proceedings if the company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des
_paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court_
finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open insolvency proceedings ex officio (absent
a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the
suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain
limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured
creditors in accordance with their rank upon foreclosure of the assets;

- controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a

##### 374


-----

provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured
creditors. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the
creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in
order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as
acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during
controlled management proceedings; or

- composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company (subject to obtaining the prior consent of the majority of its creditors
holding 75% at least of the claims against such company) and not by its creditors themselves.
The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay
on enforcement of claims by creditors.

In addition to these insolvency proceedings, your ability to receive payment under the transaction
documents may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de
_paiement) or_ to put the Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial
liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies
pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the
commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as
amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”). The management of such liquidation proceedings
generally will follow rules similar to those applicable to insolvency proceedings. Liability of the
company in respect of the transaction documents will, in the event of a liquidation of such company
following insolvency or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant
entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law
include, among others:

- certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg revenue authorities;

- value-added taxes and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg customs and excise
authorities;

- social security contributions; and

- remuneration owed to employees.

For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for
distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is
foreclosed upon), and subject to application of the relevant priority rule and liens and privileges
arising mandatorily by law.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may affect transactions entered into or payments made by the
Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, or the suspect period (période suspecte),
which is a maximum of six months from the date on which the Luxembourg Commercial Court
formally adjudicates a person insolvent and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an
additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment
declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect
period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another bankruptcy proceeding
(e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law.

##### 375


-----

In particular:

- pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), specified
transactions (such as the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of
debts that have not fallen due; whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment,
sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means
other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; or the sale of assets without consideration or
with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten
days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcy
receiver; article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply to financial
collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law,
such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares or receivables to the extent that they secure
payment obligations and/or obligations to deliver financial instruments on the underlying assets
of such instruments;

- pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions concluded during the suspect period are subject to
cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the bankruptcy receiver if they were
concluded with the knowledge of the insolvent party’s cessation of payments; article 446 of
the Luxembourg Code of Commerce does not apply to financial collateral arrangements and
set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg law
pledges over shares or receivables to the extent that they secure payment obligations and/or
obligations to deliver financial instruments on the underlying assets of such instruments;

- regardless of the suspect period, Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and
Article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to
challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy; and

- pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a financial collateral arrangement
entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of
reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against
third parties, administrators, bankruptcy receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect
period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the
secured party proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened
or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic
termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity
of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy
order. However, the bankruptcy receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid
worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no
interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings
may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and
on the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under transaction documents.

The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts
(i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue
the business of the company, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court
and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply:

- the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of an bankruptcy
constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and

- _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts where the identity of the other party constitutes an_
essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the

##### 376


-----

bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the
company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts.

The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the insolvent party that are
still to be performed after bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the insolvent
party prior to bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in
bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or
seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific
performance of the contract.

International aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or voluntary arrangement
with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to the EU
Insolvency Regulation, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation
to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned
has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation).
The determination of where any such company has its COMI is a question of fact on which the
courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time.
Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that
any such company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence
of proof to the contrary (that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved
to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of
insolvency proceedings). However, Recital 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that it should
be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State
other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of
management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.
In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company
conducts the majority of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s creditors
are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where a company has its COMI.
The time when a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency
proceedings are opened.

If the COMI of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency
Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although
secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the COMI of a debtor is in one
Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts
of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings”
only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings
are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If a
company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member
State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

If the Luxembourg Security Provider’s COMI is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such
other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Luxembourg Security
Provider.

_Security Interests Considerations_

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the
_lex rei sitae_ or _lex situs_ (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or
security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests
over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation,
perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank account
held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law or having debtors
located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through an
account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such
assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance
with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and
enforcement of pledges over shares, bank account and receivables located or deemed to be located in
Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain
registration, notification and acceptance requirements. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law
sets forth the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event:

- the direct appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets
at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or
(ii) if listed, the listing price of the pledged assets;

- a sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms
(conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way
of a public auction;

- a court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations
following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

- set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on
(i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourse and (iv)
the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers,
the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may
not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security
interests or arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under the Luxembourg Collateral Law
and the powers of any receivers or administrators, might not be recognized or enforced by the
Luxembourg courts, particularly where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to
Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction
because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency
proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and
such security interests or arrangements constitute rights _in rem_ over assets located in another
Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance with Article 8 of
the EU Insolvency Regulation.

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments
arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to

##### 378


-----

payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges
_occultes). This includes, in particular, the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official_
as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of
the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (such as social security bodies), which preferences may
extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle
precedence over the privilege of the beneficiary of security interests in respect of pledged assets.

_Financial Assistance_

Any security interests granted by Luxembourg entities, which constitute breach of the provisions on
financial assistance as defined by Article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any
other similar provisions, might not be enforceable.

_Registration in Luxembourg_

The registration of the Notes, the Security Documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents
(and any document in connection therewith) with the _Administration de l’Enregistrement et des_
_Domaines et de la TVA in Luxembourg is not required. Where the Notes, the Security Documents,_
the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith) are (i)
voluntarily presented to the registration formalities or (ii) appended to a document that requires
mandatory registration, either a nominal registration duty or an ad valorem duty (or, for instance,
0.24% of the amount of the payment obligation mentioned in the document so registered) will
be payable depending on the nature of the document to be registered. No ad valorem duty is payable
in respect of security interest agreements, which are subject to the Luxembourg Collateral law.

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the Security
Documents, the Indenture and the transaction documents (and any document in connection therewith)
and any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Italy**

**_Limitation on Validity and Enforceability of Guarantees and Security Interests under Italian Law_**

Under Italian law, the entry into of a transaction (including the creation of a security interest or the
granting of a personal guarantee) by a company incorporated under Italian law must be permitted by
the applicable laws and by its by-laws (statuto sociale) and is subject to compliance with rules on
corporate benefits, corporate authorisation and certain other Italian mandatory provisions. If a
guarantee or a security interest is being provided in the context of an acquisition, group reorganization,
refinancing or restructuring, financial assistance issues may also be triggered.

An Italian company (each an “Italian Guarantor”) entering into a transaction (including granting a
guarantee or a security interest), must receive a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the guarantee
or the security interest being provided by such company. Such principle on corporate benefit applies
equally to down-stream, cross-stream and up-stream guarantees granted by Italian companies. While
the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a downstream guarantee is usually self-evident (i.e.,
a guarantee/security guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant
guarantor), the existence of a corporate benefit in relation to a cross-stream or an up-stream guarantee
(i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing financial obligations of direct or indirect parent companies or sister
companies of the relevant guarantor) depends on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in
exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved
that the guarantor may derive some benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or
security interest, therefore it should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis (such as in the
case of Italian Guarantors which are providing the Note Guarantees or a security interest under the
Security Documents).

##### 379


-----

The concept of “corporate benefit” is not expressly defined under Italian law and it is assessed and
determined on a case-by-case basis, further its existence is purely a business decision of the directors
and the statutory auditors. As a general rule, corporate benefit is assessed at the level of the relevant
company on a standalone basis, although in certain circumstances, and subject to specific rules, the
interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. In
particular, in case of up-stream and cross-stream guarantees for the financial obligations of group
companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through
intercompany loans from other members of the group, while transactions featuring debt financings of
distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is
provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate
benefit and conflict of interest. Generally, the risk assumed by an Italian Guarantor must not be
disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to such Italian Guarantor.

In principle, absence of a real and adequate benefit could make the Note Guarantees or the security
interest created under the Security Documents ultra vires and potentially affected by conflict of interest
and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be subject matter
of challenges and annulment.

As a result, civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian Guarantor if a court holds
that it did not act in the best interest of such Italian Guarantor and that the acts they carried out do not
fall within the corporate purpose of the relevant Italian Guarantor or were against mandatory
provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil
liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian Guarantor or
having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. However, no liability
can be attributed where no prejudice or actual damage is suffered by the Italian Guarantor because of
the determination of the controlling shareholder as provided under Article 2497 of the Italian Civil
Code having regard to the overall result of the controlling activity. Moreover, the Note Guarantees or
the security interest created under the Security Documents could be declared null and void if the lack
of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third-party involved in the transaction
and such third-party acted intentionally against the interest of such Italian Guarantor.

The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, down-stream or cross-stream
guarantees, either in the form of a security interest or a personal guarantee, granted by an Italian
Guarantor.

As to corporate authorisations prospective, the granting of a guarantee by an Italian company in favour
of third-parties or other corporations belonging to the same group of companies of the Italian
Guarantor must be permitted by the by-laws (statuto) of the Italian company providing such guarantee.

In addition, the granting of a guarantee or a security interest by an Italian company cannot include any
liability which would result in unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of Article 2358 or
2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code pursuant to which, subject to specific exceptions,
it is unlawful for a company to give financial assistance (whether by means of loans, security,
guarantees or otherwise) to support the acquisition or subscription by a third-party of its own shares
or quotas or those of any entity that (directly or indirectly) controls the Italian company. Financial
assistance for refinancing indebtedness originally incurred for the purchase or subscription of its own
shares or quotas or those of its direct or indirect parent company would also be a violation of financial
assistance provisions. Any loan, guarantee or security given or granted in breach of these provisions
is null and void. In addition, directors may be personally liable for failure to act in the best interests of
the company.

In the event that an Italian guarantor enters into insolvency proceedings, any guarantee or security
interest granted by it could also be subject to potential challenges by a court appointed officer or by

##### 380


-----

other creditors of the relevant Italian guarantor under the claw back provisions of Italian insolvency
law. If any such challenge was successful, holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts
under any guarantee or security interest provided by such Italian guarantor and any amount received
must be refunded to the insolvent company.

In the light of the above, in no event shall the obligations and liabilities of an Italian Guarantor under
a guarantee include the obligation to guarantee financial indebtedness which was incurred, in full or
in part, to purchase or subscribe to the shares of such Italian Guarantor (or of any of its direct or indirect
holding company) and which would therefore constitute the provision of financial assistance within
the meaning of Article 2358 and/or Article 2474, as the case may be, of the Italian Civil Code and/or
any other law or regulation having the same effect, as interpreted by Italian courts.

If the proceeds of the Notes were to be used for the acquisition of shares (or quotas, as applicable) in
the Subsidiary Guarantors (the entities which, amongst others, provided the Note Guarantees and/or
the security interest under the Security Documents) incorporated in Italy (or of any of its direct or
indirect holding company), this may be construed as a violation of Article 2474 and/or Article 2358
of the Italian Civil Code whereas, in the latter case, an authorisation proceeding in the shareholders’
meeting is not implemented. To this extent the total value of the guarantee cannot exceed the profits
and the distributable reserves as resulting from the approved financial statements.

Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity
within the meaning of Article 106 of the Legislative Decree No. 385 of 1 September 1993 (the “Italian
_Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively demanded to banks and authorised financial_
intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, inter alia, entail
the Note Guarantees and/or the security interest created under the Security Documents being
considered null and void. In this respect, the Ministerial Decree No. 53 of 2 April 2015, implementing
Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or security
by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify
as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies
within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies, which are under
the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, subject to the Italian Guarantor
and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees
would not amount to a restricted financial activity.

In addition, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a personal guarantee is issued to guarantee
conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum
amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee
deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held, that such
determination must be proportionate to the relevant guarantor’s assets. If such determination is deemed
disproportional to the assets of the Italian Guarantor, there is the risk that the guarantee could be
declared void. It is uncertain, however, whether courts are entitled to debate and to rule over such
determination.

Italian Law No. 108 of 7 March 1996, as amended, implemented or supplemented from time to time
(the “Italian Usury Law”), prevents lenders from applying interests higher than certain rates, as set
forth in accordance with the Italian Usury Law (the “Usury Rates”). In addition, even where the Usury
Rates are not exceeded, the interest rate applicable may be held usurious if: (i) it is considered to be
disproportionate to the amount lent (taking into account the specific circumstances of the transaction
and the average rate applicable to similar transactions in the market) and (ii) the debtor is deemed to
have been in financial and economic difficulties at the time the indebtedness was incurred.

In order to comply with (i) the Italian Usury Law and Article 1815 of the Italian Civil Code) and (ii)
the mandatory provisions of Italian law in relation to capitalization of interests (including Article 1283

##### 381


-----

of the Italian Civil Code), the obligations of any Italian Guarantor under a guarantee shall not include
and shall not extend to (x) Usury Rates and (y) any interest on overdue amounts compounded in
violation of the provisions set forth by Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, respectively.

In addition to the above, the enforcement of guarantees may further be limited by any defenses,
counterclaims and exceptions arising, inter alia, from Italian contract law, public policy principles,
mandatory provisions, procedural limitations and exceptions set forth in the Italian Civil Code, in the
Italian Code of Civil Procedure and in relevant statutory provisions, as well as by the relevant
interpretations of Italian courts.

Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest
can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are
neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or
in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a
“trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise
nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security
interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. In addition, “Parallel Debt”
principles are not recognized in Italy.

**_Certain Limitations on Enforcement_**

The enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be complex and time consuming,
especially in a liquidation scenario, given that Italian courts maintain a significant role in the
enforcement process in comparison to other jurisdictions with which the holders of the Notes may be
familiar. The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to
liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been
balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred
along with the businesses being sold.

Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees
and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to
potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy receiver or by other creditors under the rules of
ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of Italian Bankruptcy Law and the relevant law on the noninsolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally
specified period (the “suspect period”). For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and
consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Bankruptcy _(fallimento)” below._

If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any
amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security
interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or
guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents.

Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by any guarantor incorporated
under the laws of Italy apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect
of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor.

According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in
general may be subject to, inter alia, the following aspects:

(a) the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed above relating
to or affecting the rights of creditors;

(b) an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures,
the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Italian court;

##### 382


-----

(c) with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive),
each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not
offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code;

(d) claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of
Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni _and_
_decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim;_

(e) pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations
(compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for
the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary
obligation or fungible assets and are equally liquid and payable;

(f) where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a
matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that
such opinion is based on reasonable grounds;

(g) the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may
be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione
_necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary_
to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the
application of such legal concepts under Italian law;

(h) there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement
or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement
or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms
would survive such judgment might not be held to do so;

(i) enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del
_diritto);_

(j) the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument
may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation
pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code;

(k) any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal,
invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in
order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the
interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties
following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code);

(l) an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest
for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the
Italian Civil Code are satisfied;

(m) an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial
obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such
interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis;

(n) in case of bankruptcy, a receiver in bankruptcy is appointed by the court to administer the
proceeding under the supervision of the bankruptcy court and creditors’ committee and creditors
cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security
interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets
is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the bankruptcy court;

(o) the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in
which the date of the relevant seizure / attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the
absence of seizure / attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto))
and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal
interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure
proceeding / bankruptcy proceedings;

(p) in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment
to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable
date (data certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of
ensuring that a document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the
relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of
witnessing on the document;

(q) there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning
advance waivers or forfeitures;

(r) the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented
by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the
violation of mandatory provisions;

(s) penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court;

(t) Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or
litigation;

(u) a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the pledge from
continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge;
and

(v) in case of bankruptcy of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the
pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding
and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee
but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting
rights on the pledged quotas / shares.

In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an
action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the
latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its
assets, in order to seek a clawback action (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Article 2901 of
the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the
said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting
creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and
other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following
findings:

(a) that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting
creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was
fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and

(b) that, in the case of non-gratuitous act, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and,
if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that said third party participated
in the fraudulent design.

**_Limitations to the Guarantees and Security Interests_**

In order to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, inter alia, corporate benefit and
financial assistance, the maximum amount that the relevant Italian company may be required to pay
in respect of its obligations as Guarantor under the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement or as security provider, and any other transaction documents
related thereto, will be subject to limitations deriving from Italian law and/or the contractual
arrangements between the parties (e.g. in terms of cap to the secured liabilities). By virtue of these
limitations, the relevant Italian company’s obligations under its Guarantee and security interests will
be significantly less than the amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Italian company may
have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee and security interests granted by it.

We expect the proceeds from the Notes to be approximately €665.0 million, of which approximately
€617.0 million will be used for the purposes of refinancing the proceeds of the Existing Term Loans
and pay related costs, fees and expenses, representing all the proceeds from the tranche A under the
Notes (the “Tranche A”). Drawings under the Existing Term Loans were partially utilized to pay the
purchase price of the acquisition of APCOA (including the Italian Guarantors) by our existing
shareholders. The remainder of the proceeds of the Offering (approximately €48.0 million) will be
used to fund cash to our balance sheet for general corporate and working capital purposes, representing
all the proceeds from tranche B under the Notes (the “Tranche B”).

As a result of the applicable limitations under Italian law with respect to, amongst others, financial
assistance and corporate benefit, notwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in the Indenture,
the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement:

(i) the Note Guarantee and security interests granted by the relevant Italian Guarantor will only
guarantee and secure the Issuer’s obligations under Tranche B under the Notes;

(ii) any guarantee, indemnity, obligations and liability granted or assumed pursuant to the relevant
Note Guarantee and/or security interest by any Italian Guarantor does not (and will not) include
and does not (and will not) extend, directly or indirectly, to any amounts and/or payment
obligations other than the amounts and/or payment obligations under Tranche B under the Notes;

(iii) the obligations and liabilities of each Italian Guarantor as Guarantor or security provider in
respect of the obligations of any obligor which is not a subsidiary of such Italian Guarantor shall
not exceed, also for the purposes of article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, an amount equal 150%
of the aggregate of:

(a) the aggregate maximum outstanding amount of any Facility under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement at any time made available to the Italian Guarantor (or any of
its direct or indirect subsidiaries); and

(b) the aggregate maximum outstanding amount of any intercompany loans (or any other form
of financial support and/or any hybrid financing schemes which have the commercial
effect of a borrowing) advanced or made available to the Italian Guarantor (or any of its
direct or indirect subsidiaries) by any obligor as from time to time resulting from its latest
financial statements, or the different amount for which the company gives satisfactory
evidence based on its accounting books, provided that in any event the relevant Italian
Guarantor shall not be liable in relation to the obligations of any other obligor in excess of
the amount which, at any time, is drawn and outstanding in aggregate under any
intercompany loans granted to the Italian Guarantor (as borrower) by such obligor (as
lender) and which the Italian Guarantor is entitled to set-off against its claims of recourse
or subrogation (“regresso” or “surrogazione”) arising as a result of any payment made by
such Italian Guarantor under the guarantee or security interest, being understood that such
set-off right shall not be prejudiced by any provision establishing a deferral of guarantors’

##### 385


-----

rights in the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement, that will not apply to such set-off right; and

(iv) the obligations of any Italian Guarantor under the Note Guarantee and/or security interest in
respect of the obligations of any obligor shall not include and shall not extend to Usury Rates.

The above mentioned “virtual tranching” structure in respect of the Notes, which is aimed at
identifying the relevant portion of the Notes’ proceeds which does not constitute “acquisition debt”
(or refinancing thereof) in respect of any Italian Guarantor and, therefore, does not fall within the
prohibition under Italian financial assistance rules (namely, Article 2358 or 2474, as applicable, of the
Italian Civil Code), is untested in Italian courts and it cannot be excluded that it might be deemed not
sufficient to clearly distinguish and separate the non-acquisition portion of the Notes’ proceeds from
any portion of the Notes’ proceeds to be utilized to support the acquisition or subscription by the Issuer
of the share capital of, respectively, an Italian Guarantor or an entity directly or indirectly controlling
it and/or to repay existing debt originating from previous acquisition schemes and/or otherwise in
contravention of any provisions regulating financial assistance. Should the Guarantee and/or the
security interests and/or indemnities granted and/or assumed by an Italian Guarantor be deemed by a
court or public authority to be contrary to any provisions regulating financial assistance, including
Articles 2358 and 2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, such Guarantee and/or security
interests and/or indemnities as well as any other contract entered in connection therewith could be
declared null and void and the Notes documents will provide that, if and to the extent such Guarantee
would result in a breach of any provisions regulating financial assistance, including Articles 2358 and
2474, as applicable, of the Italian Civil Code, applicable to such Italian Guarantor, such an Italian
Guarantor will be deemed to have no liability thereunder and the Guarantee shall not be in force and
effect ab initio. As a result of the financial assistance requirements addressed by the limitation
language mentioned above as well as considering that (A) the proceeds of the Notes will be partially
used for refinancing the debt for the purchase of the Italian Guarantors, and (B) there is no real
tranching of the Notes under the Indenture and that “virtual tranching” is untested in the Italian
jurisdiction, in absence of the application of the whitewash procedure set out by Italian law, the
relevant Italian Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee and security interests
granted by it. In addition, considering that the guaranteed aggregate amount under its Guarantee and
security interests is capped to the amount of the intercompany loans or other financial support in any
form received by it or its subsidiaries, that Guarantee and security interests would have a very limited
value if no intercompany loans or other financial support (having the commercial effect of a
borrowing) proceeds would be down-streamed to such entities.

For the avoidance of doubt, the “virtual tranching” of the Notes is aimed at identifying the separate
portions of the proceeds from the Offering to be used by the Issuer to (i) refinance the proceeds under
the Existing Term Loans utilized for refinancing the debt for the (direct or indirect) acquisition of the
Italian Guarantors and related costs, fees and expenses, and (ii) to fund cash to balance sheet for general
corporate and working capital purposes, respectively, and will not entail issuing separate identifiers
(ISINs or Common Codes) for each such virtual tranche under the Notes.

**_Certain Italian Insolvency Law Considerations_**

The insolvency laws of Italy may not be as favourable to investors’ interests as those of other
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency
process. Moreover, in-court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of
security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in
jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include
special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorised to carry out certain
reserved activities (except for the description of certain insolvency proceeding to which they may be

##### 386


-----

subject) nor does it provide a comprehensive description of insolvency laws applicable to public
companies.

A comprehensive reform of the Italian insolvency laws and of the regulation of overindebtedness crises
has been introduced (“2019 Reform”). In particular, on 19 October 2017, the Italian Senate approved
Law No. 155, pursuant to which it has authorized the government to carry out a substantial reform of
Italian insolvency laws, on the basis of several guidelines. The purpose of the 2019 Reform was mostly

(i) to ensure the rationality of the provisions on insolvency, affected over the years by various
amendments (especially in the civil sector) which caused a great degree of legal uncertainty, (ii) to
allow early awareness of the financial distress of a business and (iii) to safeguard the business’
entrepreneurial potential during a crisis.

On 12 January 2019, the government enacted a new bankruptcy code implementing the guidelines
contained in Law No. 155 dated 19 October 2017, which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework
in order to regulate, inter alia, insolvency matters (the “Insolvency Code”). The main amendments
included:

(i) the elimination of the term “bankruptcy” (fallimento) due to its negative connotation and its
replacement with a reference to a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale), (ii) the introduction of
a definition of state of crisis (stato di crisi), (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in
order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different judicial insolvency proceedings
provided for by the Insolvency Code, (iv) the adoption of the definition of debtor’s “centre of main
_interests” as provided for in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (v) the introduction_
of restrictions relating to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato
_preventivo) in order to favour going-concern restructurings, (vi) a new preventive alert and mediation_
phase to avoid insolvency, (vii) providing for the jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings
involving large debtors and (viii) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at
ensuring the general effectiveness of the 2019 Reform. Therefore, the practical consequences of its
implementation and its potential impact on the existing insolvency proceedings cannot to date be
foreseen and significant amendments are expected in the near future that may impact the provisions
set forth therein. All types of debtors, with the exception of the State and public entities, will be subject
to the procedures set out therein. Indeed, the Insolvency Code shall apply both to natural persons
(consumers, professionals and entrepreneurs) and to legal persons (including non-profit companies,
organizations and groups of companies).

On 14 February 2019, the Insolvency Code has been published in the official journal. Except for minor
changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code (and certain express repeals in the criminal sector)
which already entered into force on 16 March 2019, according to Article 389 of the Legislative Decree
No. 14 of 12 January 2019, the Insolvency Code will enter into force 18 months following its
publication in Italy’s official journal (i.e., 15 August 2020). Nevertheless, in response to the COVID19 pandemic, such entry into force of the Insolvency Code has been currently postponed to 1
September 2021, according to Article 5 of the Law Decree No. 23 of 8 April 2020, converted into Law
no. 40 of 5 July 2020 (“Law Decree No. 23/20”). Until that date, insolvency proceedings will continue
to be governed by Italian Royal Decree No. 267 of 16 March 1942 (the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”), as
in force before.

Leaving aside the 2019 Reform, the Italian Bankruptcy Law saw many reforms in the near past. In
particular, material innovations regarding composition with creditors and debt restructuring
agreements under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and out of court restructuring plans
pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law were introduced by Law Decree
No. 83 of 22 June 2012, as converted by Law No. 134 of 3 August 2012 (the “Development Decree”).
The purpose of this reform was to boost the restructuring and reorganization of distressed enterprises

##### 387


-----

in order to cope better with the current financial crisis. To achieve this purpose, the Development
Decree has focused mainly on three factors: flexibility of the process, reliability of the restructuring
plan and tax appeal.

Amendments to the Italian Bankruptcy Law were also introduced with regard to the composition with
creditors by Decree No. 69 of 21 June 2013, which sets out urgent measures aimed at boosting the
country’s economy (the “Decreto del Fare”) and includes some important changes to the rules
regarding the application introduced by the Development Decree.

A significant reform was approved by the Italian government on 23 June 2015, through a Law Decree
containing urgent reforms applicable, inter alia, to the Italian Bankruptcy Law (the “Decree No. 83”).
The Decree No. 83 (“Urgent reforms concerning Bankruptcy Law, Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law
_and Court administration”) entered into force in June 2015 and was incorporated into Italian law by_
Italian Law No. 132 of 6 August 2015 (“Law 132”). Law 132/2015 entered into force on 21 August
2015.

The primary aim of the Italian Bankruptcy Law used to be to liquidate the debtor’s assets (with the
continuation of the assets as a going-concern (where applicable) only if this would satisfy a creditor’s
claim). This competing aim often has been balanced by the sale of businesses as going-concerns and
ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. However, the Italian
Bankruptcy Law has been subsequently amended with a view to promoting rescue procedures rather
than liquidation, focusing on the continuity and survival of financially distressed businesses and
enhancing pre-bankruptcy restructuring options.

Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the
insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor
and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a
debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent,
and not a temporary, status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent.

In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general,
financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out of court arrangements with its creditors,
which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible to being reviewed by a
court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In
addition, the following proceedings are available to companies dealing with a crisis and/or facing
insolvency under Italian law.

**_Restructuring Outside of a Judicial Process (concordati stragiudiziali)_**

Restructuring generally takes place through a formal judicial process because it is more favourable to
the debtor and because out of court arrangements put in place as a result of an out of court restructuring
are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and may possibly
be challenged as voidable transactions. However, in cases where a company is solvent, but facing
financial difficulties, it may be possible for it to enter into an out of court arrangement with its
creditors, which may help to preserve the company.

**_Out of court Debt Restructuring Plan Pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian_**
**_Bankruptcy Law (piano attestato di risanamento)_**

Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for an out of court restructuring
procedure based on a rescue plan (piano attestato di risanamento) and is aimed at restructuring the
company’s indebtedness and ensuring the stability of its financial condition. An independent expert
appointed by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei
_Revisori Contabili) has to verify the financial and commercial feasibility of the restructuring plan and_

##### 388


-----

the accuracy of the business and accounting data provided by the company and included in the plan,
without the need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain
specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399
of the Italian Civil Code. The expert may be liable for misrepresentation or false certification.

The terms and conditions of the restructuring plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are
finalised at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in
composition with creditors proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out of court debt
restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law do not offer
the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party
creditors. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared
bankrupt, the payments and/or acts carried out for the implementation of the reorganisation plan,
subject to certain conditions: (a) are not subject to clawback action; and (b) are exempted from the
potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in
the companies’ register are needed (although, publication in the companies’ register is possible upon
a debtors request and would allow for certain tax benefits) and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or
disvalue judgments are lower than in case of a court-supervised composition with creditors or a debt
restructuring agreement.

In order to grant protection against clawback actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities,
out of court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the Italian Bankruptcy
Law must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial
situation of the company. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring
of the indebtedness of the debtor and the rebalancing of its financial position and, in case of its failure
and subsequent challenge before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as unreasonable.

**_Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)_**

A company which is insolvent or in a status of crisis (i.e., financial distress which does not yet amount
to insolvency) has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision,
in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganise its business, thereby avoiding a
declaration of insolvency and the initiation of bankruptcy proceeding (“Composition with Creditors,”
so-called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial
enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in
an aggregate amount exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross
revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding
fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million. Only the debtor company can
initially file a petition for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the company’s
main office. The debtor shall submit the petition together with, _inter alia, a restructuring plan_
containing an analytical description of manner and timing of the fulfilment of the proposal and an
independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of
the business and accounting data provided by the company. Plans based on business continuity further
require the expert to certify that business continuity would be beneficial for the creditors. The petition
for _concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the companies’ register and_
communicated to the public prosecutor.

The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring
and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure
payment of at least 20 per cent. of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of Composition with
Creditors with continuity of the going-concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to
Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions such as
the granting to creditors and their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (also
convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver

##### 389


-----

(assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division
of creditors into different classes, provided that each class is composed of creditors having
homogeneous legal positions and economic interests; and (iv) different treatments for creditors
belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement
for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

In order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law No. 132 sets forth that a
Composition with Creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a preComposition with Creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having
such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors
are paid in a percentage of at least 20 per cent. of their claims. This provision does not apply to
Composition with Creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going-concern (concordato
_con continuità aziendale)._

Under the Composition with Creditors there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains
management powers under the supervision of a court appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and
the delegated judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court
sanctions the _concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its_
business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. During
this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors,
whose title arose beforehand, are stayed (“Automatic Stay”). The accrual of interests is suspended for
the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors
cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the
90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the
companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act, payment or security
executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its
rules and procedures is exempt from clawback action. The debtor is also exempt from certain
bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, paragraph 3 (preferential bankruptcy), and 217
(simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, in relation to acts and payments made in execution
of the Composition with Creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 182-quinquies
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried
out by the distressed company have super-priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy (see “Statutory priorities” below). In addition, pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, also the claims arising from financing, in any form, granted in execution of the
Composition with Creditors (finanza in esecuzione) or with the purpose of filing the application for
concordato preventivo (so-called “finanza ponte”) have legal super-priority (prededucibilità) in the
event of a subsequent bankruptcy, accordingly to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Claims
arising from finanza ponte have super-priority in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy on the condition
that the financing is provided by the plan and it is stated in the decree admitting the Composition with
Creditors.

The filing of the application for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a_
preliminary and simplified petition for a concordato preventivo (so-called _concordato in bianco,_
pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Law Decree No.
69 of 21 June 2013, as converted into Italian Law No. 98 of 9 August 2013). The debtor company may
file such petition along with (i) its financial statements of the last three financial years and (ii) the list
of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to
submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by
the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to
only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such
extension. Nevertheless, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Article 9 of Law Decree No. 23/20,
provides that the debtor company which has been granted such extension by the Court, can, before the
deadline, request for a further extension up to 90 days, even if it has been filed an appeal for a

##### 390


-----

declaration of bankruptcy. The petition provides for the elements that make it necessary to grant the
extension with specific reference to the events that have occurred as a result of the epidemiological
emergency COVID-19. The Court, acquired the opinion of the judicial commissioner (if appointed),
grants the extension when it considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds. The petition
may be filed by the debtor who has been granted the hearing referred to in the Article 182-bis,
paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The Court in closed session, omitted the obligations
provided for in Article 182-bis, paragraph 7, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, grants the extension when
considers that the application is based on reasonable grounds and that the conditions for reaching a
debt restructuring agreement with the majorities referred to in the Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law are satisfied. In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition
for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law). If accepts such preliminary application, it may (i) appoint a judicial commissioner
(commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out
one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of
assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of non-existent liabilities or commission of
other fraudulent acts), shall report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the
petition at court for a concordato preventivo and (ii) sets forth reporting and information duties of the
company during the above-mentioned period.

The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous
two years without the admission to the concordato preventivo having followed. The decree setting the
term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements
(relating also to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the
purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfil, at
least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company shall
file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in
the companies register. Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the
composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public
prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed
company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly
inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio,
after hearing the debtor and, if appointed, the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of
additional documents.

Following the filing of the petition for concordato in bianco and until the decree of admission to the
composition with creditors, the distressed company may (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary
activity and (ii) seek the court’s authorisation to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity,
to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company
have super-priority (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy.

In addition, pursuant to Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, new supersenior indebtedness authorised by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the DRA or
after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business
(finanza d’urgenza), are treated as super-senior (prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law. The company shall properly document: (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that
required funds cannot be obtained otherwise and (iii) that the lack of such funds would damage the
company (Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law).

The super-seniority of the claims, which arises out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing
of the petition for concordato in bianco (finanza ponte), is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents

being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato
preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. Superpriority
nature shall be expressly provided for by the plan (Article 182-quater, paragraph 2, of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law).

Pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a _concordato preventivo is based on_
business continuity (concordato con continuità aziendale) if the proposal provides for: (i) the
continuation of the business by the debtor; (ii) the sale of the business as a going-concern; (iii) or the
contribution-in-kind of the business as a going-concern to one or more companies (even if newly
incorporated). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs
and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going-concern,
as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent
expert shall also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of
creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. The plan
may provide a moratorium of up to one year from the granting of approval for the payment of creditors
secured by pledges, mortgages and liens in relation to pre-existing debts, unless the plan provides for
the liquidation of assets secured by pre-emption rights. Existing contracts, even if entered with
governmental bodies, are not be terminated by admission to procedure.

Furthermore, the going-concern based arrangements with creditors can provide for, inter alia, the
winding-up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement
may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

Under Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a debtor who files for a
concordato preventivo based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay prefiling claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they
are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors.

If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice
_delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali)_
and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally
continues to be managed by its board of directors, but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers
and judge, who shall authorise all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business.

Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree No. 83, as amended by Law
132, provides that, if the Composition with Creditors plan, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of
the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a goingconcern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the court shall open a competitive bidding process
by decree establishing the terms of participation for the bidders. A bidder’s offer is irrevocable. If there
is more than one improving offer, the Judge shall open a new competitive bidding process between
bidders. The debtor must reform concordato preventivo proposal and plan in accordance with results
of competitive bidding process.

If the plan filed by the debtor does not ensure the repayment of unsecured claims in an amount at least
equal to 40 per cent. of their nominal value (if based on liquidation) or 30 per cent. (if based on business
continuity pursuant to Article 186 bis), creditors holding claims representing at least 10 per cent. of
the aggregate debt (even if the claims have been assigned to the creditors after the filing of the
concordato preventivo petition) may submit (within 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing) a
competing Composition with Creditors proposal (proposta concorrente), alternative to the one
provided by the debtor. These creditors are entitled to vote on the proposta concorrente only if they
are located in an independent class. The proposta concorrente setting out several classes of creditors
shall be submitted to the bankruptcy court in order to verify the accuracy of the criteria used in creating
different classes.

##### 392


-----

The concordato preventivo proposal is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the
favourable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables entitled to vote and,
also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes.
The Composition with Creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted
in favour of the proposal. Law 132 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors
who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days
of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition
with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the
creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the
creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who have did not exercise their voting right will be
deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote
on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the
_concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of_
their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote
only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the
_concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if (i)_
the majority of the classes has approved the concordato preventivo and (ii) the court deems that the
interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through the _concordato_
_preventivo compared to other solutions If an objection to the implementation of the_ _concordato_
_preventivo is filed by at least 20 per cent. or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor_
belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court nevertheless may sanction the concordato
preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as
a result of the concordato preventivo than would be otherwise be the case.

After the approval of the concordato preventivo proposal, dissenting creditors (or creditors belonging
to a dissenting class) representing 20 per cent. or more of the liabilities may file an opposition
(opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the
authority to “cram-down” dissenting creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that
the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a Bankruptcy
scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the bankruptcy court approves the Composition with Creditors
and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan, if it has to be realised by
way of a transfer of assets. The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to
implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required.

If the creditors participating at the meeting do not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may,
upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor and after having ascertained the condition for
declaration of bankruptcy, declare the company bankrupt.

The terms and the performance of outstanding contracts are not automatically affected by concordato
_preventivo. However, pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may_
request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora
_ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the_
scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), certain
preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita) and certain real estate lease agreements
(contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of
the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the
application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending
agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In
such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the
damages suffered for the non-fulfilment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid as an
unsecured claim arisen prior to the pre-bankruptcy composition.

##### 393


-----

In the event of a breach of the Composition with Creditors plan or fraud, bankruptcy may follow, at
the behest of the bankruptcy court. If the Composition with Creditors is implemented, the debts are
discharged and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in
his possession). Claims (including claims for repayment of loans) arising in the course of the
implementation of the plan (whether before or after approval, conditional upon the bankruptcy court
confirming such priority in the decree of admission), are granted the highest priority and must be paid
in full.

_Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the_
companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors,
guarantors of the debtor and other joint and severally liable debtors.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Article 9 of the Law Decree No. 23/20, the
deadlines for the fulfilment of _concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements_
(accordi di ristrutturazione omologati) expiring after 23 February 2020 shall be extended by six
months.

**_Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy_**
**_Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)_**

Under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a company that is in financial distress or is
insolvent may file before the bankruptcy court an application for the validation (omologazione) of a
debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) (“DRA”)
representing at least

60 per cent. of its aggregate outstanding debts, pursuing the rebalancing of its financial situation (e.g.
through refinancing, moratoria, write-offs, waivers or tax settlement).

An independent expert, directly appointed by the debtor, must assess the truthfulness of the debtor’s
business and accounting data provided by the company and declare that the agreement is feasible and,
in particular, that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within a 120 day
term from: (i) the date of ratification of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due
and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (“omologazione”) of
the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in
case of receivables which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date
of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who
is insolvent or in a state of crisis (i.e., facing financial distress which does not yet amount to
insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt
restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors.

The DRA must be published in the Italian companies’ register to become effective in respect of thirdparties. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from such
publication. The court will, after having settled the oppositions (if any), validate the agreement by
issuing a decree, which may be appealed within 15 days of its publication.

The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of
the DRA. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the prosecution of the business by the
debtor or by a third-party, or the sale of the business to a third-party and may contain, refinancing
agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The DRA may also contain a
proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes.

The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60 per
cent. of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring

##### 394


-----

agreements (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial
creditors.

_The Key Features of a DRA_

A bylaw 60-day moratorium (automatic stay) applies starting from the date of publication of the DRA.
During the standstill period creditors cannot start or continue any interim proceedings or enforcement
actions over the assets of the debtor. Creditors cannot obtain any security interest (unless it is agreed
in the DRA) in relation to the pre-existing debts. The moratorium can be requested, pursuant to Article
182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, by the debtor to the court pending negotiations
with creditors (prior to the DRA’s above-mentioned publication of the agreement) subject to the
fulfilment of certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register
and becomes effective as of the date of publication. No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a
DRA. It is a court- supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year
(the duration of the proceedings is generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the
DRA are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to
protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party not adhering creditors,
who shall be fully repaid within 120 days from validation of the DRA (if the claims are already due
and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date.

The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation, sets the date for the hearing within
30 days from the publication and orders the debtor to supply to the creditors the relevant
documentation in relation to the moratorium. In such hearing, creditors and other interested parties
may file an opposition to the DRA and the court assesses whether the conditions for granting the
moratorium have been met and, if the court so determines, orders, that no interim relief or enforcement
action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be acquired over the
assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which the DRA has to be filed.
The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time deadline
of 60 days, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without
prejudice to the effect of the moratorium.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree
83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, debtors whose financial indebtedness (i.e., debts with banks
or other financial intermediaries) is at least 50 per cent. of their total indebtedness are entitled to enter
into debt restructuring agreements obtaining the approval of financial creditors representing at least
75 per cent. of the aggregate financial claims of the relevant category and ask the court to declare such
agreement binding on the dissenting financial creditors belonging to the same category (so-called
“cram-down”), if they (a) hold claims not exceeding 25 per cent. of the aggregate value of claims
included in a consenting class, (b) have been duly informed of the negotiations relating to the DRA
and have been granted the opportunity to participate in good faith, (c) have received complete and
updated information on the economic and financial performance of the debtor and (d) are paid an
amount at least equal to what would be recoverable according to feasible alternative scenarios. If the
abovementioned conditions are met, then the remaining 25 per cent. of non-participating financial
creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, crammed down
creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it, on the basis of the lack of homogeneity
of the classes of creditors. Similarly, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into
between a debtor and financial creditors representing 75 per cent. of that debtor’s aggregate financial
indebtedness would also bind the non-participating financial creditors, provided that (i) they have been
informed of the ongoing negotiations and have been allowed to participate in such negotiations in good
faith; and (ii) an expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies that the non-consenting banks and financial intermediaries have legal
status and economic interests similar to those of the banks and financial intermediaries which have
agreed to the moratorium arrangement. The banks and financial intermediaries which have not agreed

##### 395


-----

to the moratorium arrangement may challenge it (opposizione) within 30 days after having been
notified of the moratorium arrangement.

Such debt restructuring agreements and standstill agreements will not affect the rights of non-financial
creditors (e.g. trade creditors) who cannot be crammed down and must be paid within 120 days if not
participating to a scheme.

In no case the debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law or the moratorium arrangement may impose on the non-adhering creditors the
performance of new obligations, the granting of new over-draft facilities, the maintenance of the
possibility to utilize existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities.

Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant
to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a _concordato preventivo) (finanza in esecuzione)_
enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted
by shareholders, but only up to 80 per cent. of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e.,
before) presentation of a petition for the sanctioning (omologazione) a debt restructuring agreement or
a Composition with Creditors (finanza ponte) may be granted such priority status provided that it is
envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement and that such priority is expressly provided for by the
court in the context of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement or the
approval of the concordato preventivo. Same provisions apply to financings granted by shareholders
up to 80 per cent. of their amount.

Pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court, pending the
sanctioning (omologazione) of the DRA, or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to
Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or of a petition pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (concordato in bianco, described below) may authorise
the debtor to: (i) obtain new interim financings, having super-priority in the event of a subsequent
bankruptcy, if an independent expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial
needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that such new financings are
aimed at greater creditors’ satisfaction (finanziamenti interinali); and (ii) pay debts deriving from the
supply of services or goods, already payable and due, provided that, the expert declares that such
payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for
all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132,
the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation
required pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law,
pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182_bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application_
pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan
pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 2(e), of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorise
the debtor to incur in new indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the
company’s business (finanza d’urgenza). The company, while filing such request of authorization, is
required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing, (ii) that it is unable to otherwise obtain the required
funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to
the company. Such indebtedness is treated as super-senior (credito prededucibile) pursuant to Article
111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both DRA and to the
compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined above.

##### 396


-----

All the acts, payments and guarantees over assets of the distressed company executed and/or performed
according to a validated (omologato) DRA are exempt from clawback actions (revocatoria
_fallimentare) in the event of subsequent Bankruptcy._

The exemptions from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 216, paragraph 3
(preferential _bankruptcy), and 217 (simple bankruptcy) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law apply, in_
relation to acts and payments made in accordance with the validated DRA and/or in relation to finance
provided under Article 182-quinquies upon judicial authorization (in respect of concordato preventivo,
see above). Such exemption would not expressly apply in relation to the financings obtained “in view”
of a DRA (i.e. in order to file the DRA—so-called “finanza ponte”), provided under Article 182-quater
of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

**_Bankruptcy (Fallimento)_**

Bankruptcy (fallimento) is a court-supervised procedure for the liquidation of an insolvent company’s
assets and for the distribution of the proceeds. It results in the company’s dissolution.

A company is declared bankrupt when insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under the Italian Bankruptcy
Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as
they come due. A request to declare a debtor company bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy
proceedings and the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor
company itself, (ii) any of its creditors, provided that the debts which become overdue during the prebankruptcy evidential phase of the procedure amount to no less than A30,000, and (iii) in certain cases,
by the public prosecutor.

The bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is
applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following
thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount
exceeding A0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi
lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding A0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and
(iii) has total indebtedness in excess of A0.5 million.

Upon the commencement of a bankruptcy proceeding, amongst other things:

(a) the debtor is dispossessed and the administration of the debtor company and the management of
its assets pass from the debtor company to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare), who
manages and disposes of the assets under the direction of the delegated judge. The debtor may
no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 43 of the
Italian Bankruptcy Law). The bankruptcy receiver is vested with such powers upon the
authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is
involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be
reinitiated by or against the bankruptcy receiver;

(b) the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made
or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third-parties
that have been carried out after the declaration of bankruptcy are not effective as regards the
creditors of the debtor (Article 45 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law);

(c) subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed and creditors must file claims
within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce
against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured
claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses.
Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank _pari passu with all of the_
bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has
obtained authorization from the designated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the

##### 397


-----

bankruptcy receiver and the creditors’ committee, the designated judge decides whether to
authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision;

(d) certain payments made, securities given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain
period before the debtor’s submission to a bankruptcy procedure (varying from six months to two
years) can be set aside and clawed-back if certain conditions are met (Article 67 of the Italian
Bankruptcy Law);

(e) any act of the debtor done after the declaration of bankruptcy (including payments made and
issuance of guarantees) is ineffective against the creditors;

(f) the beginning of bankruptcy involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a
view to a sale of all assets. However, the bankruptcy court may order that business operations be
continued whenever cessation could cause greater damage to the company, provided that the
continuation does not adversely affect the creditors of the bankrupt debtor. If the bankruptcy
court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa del fallito),
the management of the business is entrusted to the bankruptcy receiver (who may in turn avail
himself of qualified third- parties for this purpose); and

(g) the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy
declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the
general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts
where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts
are governed by specific rules provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The bankruptcy proceeding is carried out and supervised by a court appointed bankruptcy receiver, a
deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The bankruptcy
receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, but is responsible for the liquidation of the
assets of the debtor for the satisfaction of the creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation
are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights. The liquidation of a debtor can take a
considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate. In this
respect, Law No. 132 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth
the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the
liquidation of a debtor is shortened. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to
certain preferential creditors, including administrative costs associated with the bankruptcy proceeding
and related to the receiver’s running of the company, Italian tax and national social security
contributions and employee arrear of wages or salary. Such priority of payment is provided under
mandatory provisions of Italian law (and, as a consequence, it is untested and it is unlikely that priority
of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be
recognised by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities
provided by applicable law).

The following features of bankruptcy proceedings also merit mention:

- Bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors (concordato fallimentare). A bankruptcy
proceeding can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with
creditors. The procedure is aimed at speeding up bankruptcy proceedings and is an alternative
to a receiver conducting the liquidation proceedings. Over time it has proved to be more
efficient in terms of costs and timing. The relevant proposal can be filed by one or more
creditors or third-parties starting from the declaration of bankruptcy. By contrast, the debtor or
its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such
declaration but within two years following the decree giving effectiveness to the liabilities
account (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato
_fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare_
provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured

##### 398


-----

assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only
in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. If the proposal is approved, the
delegated judge orders the bankruptcy receiver to immediately notify the advocate of the
approval in order to allow him to seek approval of the plan and furthermore to notify the debtor
and any dissenting creditors. In the event that opposition is filed, the Bankruptcy Court, after
having verified the regularity of the procedure and the outcome of the vote, approves the in
bankruptcy composition proposal by means of a decree which is final and not subject to appeal.

- Under Article 124 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law the proposal may provide for the division of
creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatment among the classes), the
restructuring of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The Italian
Bankruptcy Law does not provide any guidance with respect to the content of a concordato
_fallimentare; thus, it may encompass any kind of transaction to effect the liquidation of the_
assets of the debtor (e.g., debt-equity swap, sale of assets, business assignments, etc.).

- The concordato fallimentare proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the
creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, also by a majority
(by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court ratification is also required.

- Once approved, the _concordato fallimentare is binding against all non-accepting creditors_
(cram-down).

- Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy
Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain
other European Union jurisdictions. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from the rules
of statutory priority by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim
to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that
priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual
arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are
inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The rules of statutory priority apply
irrespective of whether the proceeds are derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or
part thereof, or from a single asset.

- Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be
allocated according to the following order:

(i) for payments of “claims with super-priority” (crediti prededucibili). In general,
claims are considered to have super-priority when they are so qualified by a
specific provision of law or when they arise as part of the bankruptcy (i.e.,
claims originated in the insolvency proceedings, such as costs related to the
procedure). These claims are paid for the entire amount and before other claims
(secured, preferred, unsecured and subordinated). Examples of these claims are
bankruptcy receiver’s fees and costs; the costs of the sale of the assets; the rent
for the debtor’s offices after adjudication; employees’ salaries and social
security payments relating to the period after adjudication; attorney’s and other
advisors’ fees. Such claims are satisfied in full (including costs and interests)
with the proceeds of the liquidation of movable and immovable debtor’s assets,
according to their rank (preferred, secured, unsecured), with the exclusion of
the proceeds of the sale of assets subject to other creditors’ security interests
(mortgages and pledges), which are directed to payment of secured creditors;

(ii) for payment of claims that benefit from preferential treatment (crediti
_privilegiati in senso ampio or crediti prelatizi), which include creditors who_
hold a security interest (creditori ipotecari o pignoratizi) and creditors who
have a preference under law (creditori privilegiati in senso stretto), such as the
claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators and

##### 399


-----

claims for employee wages. As a general principle, creditors holding a security
interest are satisfied from the relevant assets to the exclusion of all other
creditors, including secured creditors having a lower rank (e.g., first mortgage
over second mortgage). However, the Italian Civil Code contains very detailed
rules (Article 2745) regulating priority conflicts between secured and preferred
creditors. A mortgagee and a pledgee are entitled to satisfy their claims from
the proceeds of the sale of the encumbered assets. Any excess is available for
distribution to other creditors (i.e., second mortgages, preferred creditors and
unsecured creditors). Where the relevant asset is insufficient to satisfy its claim
against the debtor, a creditor will rank as an unsecured creditor for the
remainder;

(iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims (crediti chirografari).
Unsecured creditors have no preference or security and will therefore be paid
only if and to the extent any proceeds of the estate remain after all other claims
have been satisfied. Unsecured creditors rank pari passu among themselves in
the estate, in proportion to the size of their claims;

(iv) for the payment of subordinated creditors’ claims (creditori postergati e
_subordinati). Subordinated creditors have no preference or security and are_
subordinated by law or contractual provisions. They shall be paid only if and
when all the creditors with a higher rank have been paid in full.

- Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is the
equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent
statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim
than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by
the bankruptcy receiver are strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor
over the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinised and
potentially unwound as preferential.

- Under Italian law, there are “clawback” or avoidance provisions that lead to, inter alia, the
revocation of payments made or security interests granted by the debtor prior to the declaration
of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made
below market value, preferential transaction, transactions made with a view to defrauding
creditors or to advantage one creditor. Clawback rules under Italian law are normally
considered to be particularly favourable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules
applicable in other jurisdictions.

In a bankruptcy proceeding, depending on the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a clawback
period of up to either one year or six months in certain circumstances (please note that in the
context of extraordinary administration procedures, see below, in relation to certain
transactions, the clawback period can be extended to five and three years, respectively) and a
two year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. The Italian Bankruptcy Law
distinguishes between acts or transactions, which are ineffective by operation of law and acts
or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court
commissioner, as detailed below.

(a) Acts ineffective by operation of law.

(i) Under Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited
exceptions, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective vis_à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor in the two-year period prior to the_
insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective
pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the
bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the

##### 400


-----

declaration of bankruptcy, without needing to wait until the ineffectiveness of
the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge
the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law; and

(ii) Under Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of debts falling due
on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective
vis-à-vis creditors, if made by the debtor within the two year period prior to
the insolvency declaration.

(b) Acts and transactions that could be declare ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy
receiver/ court commissioner.

(i) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period
specified below, may be clawed-back (revocati) _vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as_
provided for by Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared
ineffective unless the other party proves that it had no actual or constructive
knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered
into:

       - the onerous transactions entered into in the year preceding the insolvency
declaration, where the value of the debt or of the obligations undertaken
by the debtor exceeds by 25 per cent. the value of the consideration
received by and/or promised to the debtor;

       - payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor, which were not
paid in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year preceding
the insolvency declaration;

       - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the year preceding the
insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which have not
yet fallen due; and

       - pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt in the six months preceding
the insolvency declaration in order to secure which had fallen due.

(ii) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period
specified below, may be clawed-back and declared ineffective if the
bankruptcy receiver that the other party knew that the bankrupt entity was
insolvent at the time of the act or transaction:

       - the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any
onerous transactions entered into or made within six months before the
insolvency declaration; and

       - the granting of a preferential right for debts simultaneously created (even
those of third- parties) and made within six months preceding the
insolvency declaration.

The following transactions are exempt from clawback actions:

       - a payment for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business
according to market practice;

       - a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not reduce the
bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank in a material and lasting manner;

##### 401


-----

           - a sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645_bis of the Italian Civil Code, in force as at the date of this Offering_
Memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property
that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s
family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that
is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser, on the
condition that, as of the date of the insolvency declaration, such activity is
actually exercised or the investments for the start of such activity have been
carried out;

           - transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted with
respect to the bankrupt entity’s goods, provided that they concern the
implementation of a piano di risanamento attestato (see “—Out of court
_debt restructuring plan pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3(d), of the_
_Italian Bankruptcy Law (piano attestato di risanamento)” above);_

           - a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee issued to
implement a concordato preventivo (see “—Court-supervised pre_bankruptcy composition with creditor (concordato preventivo)” above)_
or an accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti (see “—Debt Restructuring
_Agreements with Creditors Pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian_
_Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti)” above) and_
transactions entered into, payments made and security interests granted
after the filing of the application for a concordato preventivo (see above);

           - remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and
consultants; and

           - payment of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due
date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato
preventivo procedure.

The limitation period for initiating clawback action is three years from the declaration of bankruptcy
or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed-back.

In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the
bankrupt entity be declared without effect vis-à-vis the acting creditors within the Italian Civil Code
ordinary clawback period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil
Code, a creditor may demand that transactions through which the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets
to the detriment of such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided
that the bankrupt entity was aware of such detriment (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to
the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the
debtor in order to cause detriment of such creditor’s rights) and that, in the case of a transaction entered
into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such detriment (and, if the
transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person
participated in the fraudulent design). Burden of proof is entirely with the receiver.

The _Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group_
transactions. Under Article 290 the limitation period for initiating intra-group clawback actions
(referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that
jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for bankruptcy declaration.

Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a
“simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place

##### 402


-----

by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In
particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without
previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to
the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers,
or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so-called fondo patrimoniale—”family trust”).
In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by the creditor against
the third-party purchaser.

Please note that under Article 10 of Law Decree No. 23/20, when the declaration of inadmissibility of
the bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) or the insolvency proceedings with regards to a compulsory
administrative liquidation (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) or an extraordinary administration
(amministrazione straordinaria) pending between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 is anyway followed
by the bankruptcy declaration, the aforesaid period is not included in the terms set forth, inter alia, in
Articles 64, 65, 67 para 1 and 2 and 69-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law referring to the clawback
actions.

**_Extraordinary Administration for Large Insolvent Companies Pursuant to Prodi-bis Decree_**
**_(Amministrazione Straordinaria)_**

An extraordinary administration procedure applies under Italian law for large industrial and
commercial enterprises (the “Prodi-bis Procedure” or “Extraordinary Administration”). Prodi-bis
Procedure, which is regulated by Legislative Decree No. 270 of 8 July 1999 (“Prodi-bis Decree”),
replaces the previous special administration for large companies in a state of crisis (amministrazione
_straordinaria delle grandi Imprese in crisi), introduced by Law No. 95 of 3 April 1979._

The relevant company must be insolvent, but demonstrating serious recovery prospects. To qualify for
this procedure, the company must have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year. In
addition, it must have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements
and two-thirds of its income from sales and services during its last financial year. Any of the creditors,
the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor may make a petition to commence an extraordinary
administration procedure. The same rules set forth for bankruptcy with respect to existing contracts
and creditors’ claims largely apply to Extraordinary Administration.

The procedure is divided into two main phases: a “judicial phase” and an “administrative phase.”

(a) Judicial phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets
the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect
and appoints a judicial receiver (or up to three) (commissario giudiziale) to investigate
whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganisation.
The judicial receiver files a report with the court within 30 days, and within ten days
from such filing, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development may make an opinion
on the admission of the company to the extraordinary administration procedure. The
court then decides (within 30 days from the filing of the report) whether to admit the
company to the procedure or to place it into bankruptcy.

(b) Administrative phase. Assuming that the company is admitted to the extraordinary
administration procedure, the administrative phase begins and an extraordinary
commissioner(s) is appointed by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The
extraordinary commissioner(s) prepare(s) a plan which can provide for either the sale
of the business as a going-concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry)
(the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and
financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery
_Plan”). It may also include an arrangement with creditors (e.g., debt for equity swap,_
issue of shares in a new company to whom the assets of the company have been

##### 403


-----

transferred). The plan must be approved by the Ministry of Economic Development
within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the
extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial
condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry.

The declaration of the state of insolvency produces certain immediate effects, such as the automatic
stay of all legal actions by creditors against the debtor’s assets and the freezing of the accrual of
interest.

The effects of the admission to the Prodi-bis Procedure (Administrative Phase) are that the stay of
actions continues and clawback actions become possible. Debts incurred in the continuation of the
business generally will have super-priority over any other secured and unsecured claim (prededuzione)
pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.

The unsecured creditors are exclusively represented by one or two members of the surveillance
committee, which has consulting duties. Creditors can file their proofs of claim and have a right to the
distribution of proceeds. Creditors can also oppose the declaration of the state of insolvency as well as
the admission to the second phase. Under Article 53 of Prodi-bis Decree, the rules established by the
Italian Bankruptcy Law regarding the creditors’ proofs of claim also apply to the Prodi-bis Procedure.

The Prodi-bis Procedure can at any time be converted into bankruptcy upon request by the
extraordinary commissioner, or even ex officio, if the procedure cannot be positively continued. At
the end of the procedure, upon request of the extraordinary commissioner or even ex officio, the
bankruptcy court will declare the conversion of the procedure into bankruptcy when either the sale of
the assets has been not performed within the term stipulated in the programme, or the business has not
recovered its ability to regularly perform its obligations.

Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and bankruptcy clawback law applies to the
Prodi-bis Procedure. The clawback “avoidance period” is extended up to three to five years for IntraGroup transactions.

The intragroup clawback action (revocatoria intragruppo) governed by Article 91 of Prodi-bis Decree
refers to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group if carried out
during the period between the execution of the relevant transaction and the date of insolvency
declaration (the “suspect period”) preceding the insolvency declaration as follows:

(i) five years, with respect to:

    - transactions at an undervalue (transactions are deemed to be at undervalue when the
asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by 25 per cent. or more the value of the
consideration received by the debtor);

    - transaction extinguishing of financial debts which have fallen due and are outstanding,
involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind; settlement agreements,
etc.);

    - pledges, anthicresis rights and voluntary mortgages granted or set up for pre-existing
debts which had not yet fallen due;

unless the creditor proves that it was not aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor;

(ii) three years, with respect to securities (pledges, anthicresis rights and judicial or voluntary
mortgages) created as collateral for debts which had fallen due, unless the creditor proves his

##### 404


-----

lack of knowledge of the state of insolvency of the debtor in order to rebut any claw-back
action; and

(iii) three years, with respect to payment of due and outstanding debts, transactions for
consideration and those granting a preferential right for debts (including third party’s debt)
simultaneously created, provided that the extraordinary commissioner proves that the other
party was aware of the state of insolvency of the debtor.

The extraordinary commissioner is only entitled to initiate the intragroup claw-back action after the
approval of the execution of the liquidation program (unless the Prodi-bis Procedure is converted into
_fallimento) and without the need of the authorization of the supervisory authority (i.e. Ministry of_
Economic Development).

**_Industrial Restructuring of Large Insolvent Companies Pursuant to Marzano Law (Amministrazione_**
**_Straordinaria delle Grandi Imprese in Crisi)_**

Introduced in 2003, the industrial restructuring of large insolvent companies is also known as the
“Marzano procedure.” It is complementary to the Prodi-bis Procedure and, except as otherwise
provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to be faster than the Prodi_bis Procedure and is aimed at saving and turning around large insolvent companies in order to preserve_
their value. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry of
Economic Development is made together with the filing to the court for the declaration of the
insolvency of the debtor.

The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies that, on a consolidated basis, have
at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least A300 million of
debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision of whether to open a Marzano
procedure is taken by the Ministry of Economic Development following the debtor’s request (who
must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the
relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage
the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency.

This procedure restructures the company’s debts and sells those assets that are not strategic or do not
form part of the company’s core business.

The debtor must apply to the Minister of Economic Development for immediate admission to the
procedure, while at the same time filing a petition with the bankruptcy court in order to confirm its
insolvency status. It is the Minister, rather than the bankruptcy court, that has primary responsibility
for supervising the procedure; the bankruptcy court is requested only to confirm the company’s
insolvency status and verify the lawfulness of the proceeding with respect to the verification of claims.
If the debtor is admitted to the procedure, other insolvent companies in the same corporate group may
also participate, even if they do not satisfy the relevant requirements.

The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry of Economic
Development so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. Beside some exceptions, the
restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively,
one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the
Ministry of Economic Development, the court will declare the company bankrupt and open bankruptcy
proceedings. The Recovery Plan can provide for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims through a
composition, which must specify any conditions of its implementation and describe any offered
guarantees.

The extraordinary commissioner may bring clawback actions for the benefit of creditors during the
implementation of a recovery plan. Bankruptcy rules concerning criminal bankruptcy law and

##### 405


-----

bankruptcy clawback law applies to Marzano procedure. The clawback “avoidance period” is extended
up to three to five years for intragroup transactions.

**_Compulsory Administrative Winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa)_**

A compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa) is only available for
certain companies, including, inter alia, public interest entities such as state-controlled companies,
insurance companies, credit institutions and other financial institutions, none of which can be made
subject to bankruptcy proceedings. It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the
private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is a special sort of insolvency proceeding
provided by the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Articles 194-213 and numerous special laws) in which the
entity is liquidated not by the bankruptcy court, but by the relevant administrative authority that
oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the
insolvency of the relevant entity, but also on other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal
provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the
bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of
this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore)
is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g. Bank of Italy,
Ministry of the Economic Development).

The debtor, the directors of an insolvent company, or one or more creditor(s) may apply to the
bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court must seek the advice of the government agency responsible
for supervising the debtor’s business. The judge may initiate proceedings by declaring the debtor
insolvent. All legal actions by creditors against the debtor are then stayed, with the exception of those
aiming to ascertain the amount of any claim.

The liquidator’s acts as a public officer and his actions are monitored by a steering committee
(comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the bankruptcy court
under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this
procedure. Unlike other procedures, there is no delegated judge, as the procedure is mainly
administrative in nature. The liquidator must review claims and consider whether a composition is
feasible. If so, he will prepare with the debtor a plan of repayment, to be submitted to the creditors.

The effect on creditors of the forced administrative winding-up is largely the same as under bankruptcy
proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for
bankruptcy proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to
extraordinary administration proceedings.

If a composition does not appear feasible, arrangements are made for the disposal of the debtor’s assets
and the distribution of proceeds among the creditors in the same order of priority as in bankruptcy.

**_Interim Financing_**

The Decree No. 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for debtors which
have filed a Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo) (even pursuant to Article 161,
paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) or a Debt Restructuring Agreement pursuant to Article
182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) to also obtain judicial
authorization to receive:

- new interim financing with priority status (prededucibilità) in case of subsequent bankruptcy if
an independent expert certifies that such financings are aimed at greater creditors’ satisfaction
(finanziamenti interinali) (Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law);

##### 406


-----

- urgent finance which is necessary for their business needs (finanza d’urgenza) without having
to file a certification issued by an independent expert. The relevant claims shall take precedence
over the other creditors’ claims in case of bankruptcy (crediti prededucibili). The debtor must
specify the purpose of the requested finance and declare that it is urgently needed and that the
inability to access such finance would cause imminent and irreparable damage. The Court shall
decide on this request within 10 days of the filing of the application after consultation with the
judicial commissioner and, if deemed necessary, the principal creditors. The debtor also has the
possibility to obtain authorization to continue to use existing trade receivables credit lines (linee
_di credito autoliquidanti) (Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law)._

Before the entry into force of the Decree No. 83, debtors could be granted financing with priority status
(prededucibilità) before a court’s approval of a Composition with Creditors (concordato preventivo)
or the entry into a debt restructuring agreement (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) if: (i) an expert
certified that such financing is functional to the overall restructuring process; or (ii) such financing is
provided for by the plan or the agreement, provided in each case that the court approved such priority
status.

Super-priority rights granted pursuant to the above do not jeopardize or overcome the rights in rem
(e.g., mortgages) of secured creditors.

**Norway**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

If a company is insolvent, it shall be made subject to insolvency proceedings after a petition from the
company or a creditor. The company is insolvent if the value of the company’s debt exceeds the value
of the company’s assets and the company is unable to pay its debts when due (unless the company’s
inability to pay its debts is temporary).

Once the company is declared bankrupt, the court shall appoint a bankruptcy administrator (bostyrer).
The bankruptcy administrator shall manage the bankruptcy estate in the manner most beneficial to
both secured and unsecured creditors and take all measures to ensure a swift and advantageous
realization of the assets of the company. Hence, the primary objective of the bankruptcy administrator
is, under Norwegian law, to realize all assets, distribute the proceeds to the creditors and dissolve and
de-register the company.

As a general rule, the bankruptcy estate seizes all assets and rights of the company at the time the
company is declared bankrupt, and all assets acquired thereafter, as well as any assets that can be
recovered by the bankruptcy administration. The rights of the bankruptcy estate include the right to
sell the assets, continue the business, enter into or start legal proceedings to obtain assets, reverse
transactions (under specific circumstances) and enter into various types of agreements. Secured
creditors may, in principle, realize the security, and cover their claims; however, keeping in mind that
the realization of a number of categories of security interests during the first six months after the
opening of bankruptcy proceedings will be subject to the approval of the bankruptcy estate. Subject to
certain conditions being satisfied, the bankruptcy estate has the right to realize the security and divide
the proceeds between the secured creditors and other holding legal rights in the assets. Pursuant to the
Norwegian Mortgages and Pledges Act (panteloven) (the “Pledge Act”), the bankruptcy estate of any
party which has encumbered any of its assets as security for obligations owed has a first priority
statutory lien over any such encumbered assets, and any proceeds recovered from the statutory lien
may only be applied to pay for necessary expenses (Nødvendige boomkostninger) of the estate.
However, the statutory lien does not apply to assets that has been granted as financial collateral
pursuant to the Financial Collateral Act (lov om finansiell sikkerhetsstillelse). The maximum amount
that may be recovered from a statutory lien is for each encumbered asset limited to the 5% of the
estimated value of, or sales proceeds from, the asset and is for each registered asset (real estate, ships,

##### 407


-----

aircraft and certain other assets) subject to further a limitation of 700 times the court fee from time to
time, which currently is NOK 1,199.

Norwegian bankruptcy legislation has rules whereby certain transactions by the debtor made within a
certain period prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings may be reversed. A distinction can be
made between objective and subjective rules. Objective rules apply to transactions regardless of
whether the company was insolvent at the time of the transaction and whether the company or the
counterparty can be reproached for having entered into the transaction. As a main rule, only
transactions entered into within a three-month period prior to the bankruptcy proceeding can be set
aside on the basis of an objective rule. Under certain conditions, typically regarding transactions
towards certain related parties, the three-month period may be extended. The objective rules apply to,
for example, gift transactions, security for older debt and extraordinary payments. The subjective rule
applies to transactions which improperly (i) give preference to one creditor at the expense of the others,
(ii) prevent the debtor’s assets from being used to cover the creditor’s claims, or (iii) increase the
debtor’s liabilities in a manner which is detrimental to the creditors. Such transactions may be reversed
if the debtor’s financial situation was weak or was seriously weakened by the transaction. A condition
to the application of the rule is that the other party knew or should have known of the debtor’s financial
difficulties and the circumstances which rendered the transaction improper. The subjective rule applies
to transactions made 10 years prior to the opening of bankruptcy proceedings.

Pursuant to the Norwegian Temporary Act on Reorganization to Mitigate Economic Hardship
Resulting from COVID-19 (Rekonstruksjonsloven) (the “Temporary Reorganization Act”), debtors
that are facing or in the near future will face serious economic problems, may petition the court to
commence debt reorganization proceedings. Any of the company’s creditors may also request debt
reorganization proceedings if the debtor is unable to meet its obligations as they fall due. The goal of
such proceedings is to enable the debtor to restructure its debts, following either unanimous creditor
consent (“Unanimous Reorganization”) or consent from a requisite majority of the creditors affected
(a “Non-unanimous Reorganization”). The commencement of debt reorganization proceedings results
in the appointment of a reorganization official and a creditor committee that together form a
reorganization committee. The reorganization committee is charged with supervising the debtor during
the proceedings and assisting it with putting forward a reorganization proposal to its creditors. Subject
to certain exceptions, the enforcement rights of creditors are suspended during the proceedings.

Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, a debtor in debt reorganization proceedings may provide
certain security that rank ahead of existing security interests. First, the debtor may, subject to the
consent of the reorganization committee, offer superpriority security interests over its plant and
machinery, inventory and trade receivables to lenders financing the continuation of the debtor’s
business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses. There is no amount limitation
applicable for such superpriority security interests, but existing secured creditors may petition for the
reversal of the reorganization committee’s consent if the superpriority security interest has a material
adverse effect on their position. Second, loans obtained to finance the continuation of the debtor’s
business activities during the proceedings and the associated expenses have a statutory first priority
lien over all of the debtor’s encumbered assets. The maximum amount that may be recovered from a
statutory lien is for each encumbered asset limited to the 5% of the estimated value of, or sales proceeds
from, the asset and is for each registered asset (real estate, ships, aircraft and certain other assets)
subject to further a limitation of 700 times the court fee from time to time, which currently is NOK
1,199.

A Unanimous Reorganization may in principle consist of any amendments to the debtor’s debts. The
adoption of a reorganization proposal as Unanimous Reorganization generally requires the consent of
all creditors concerned. However, in the event that no creditors have rejected the proposal following
the expiry of a voting period set by the reorganization official, the proposal will be deemed approved
if it has been approved by creditors representing three-fourths of the claims affected.

##### 408


-----

The following measures may be imposed as part of a Non-unanimous Reorganization:

- a rescheduling of the debtor’s payment obligations;

- a reduction of the debtor’s debts;

- the conversion of debt to equity capital;

- the transfer of all or parts of the debtor’s business and assets to a purchaser;

- the transfer and winding up of all the debtor’s business and assets with the debtor being released
from debts exceeding the proceeds of the winding up; and/or

- a combination of the above measures.

A Non-unanimous Reorganization cannot encroach upon the rights of non-consenting secured
creditors, creditors that enjoy preferential priority in bankruptcy (except for certain tax claims) and
creditors with set-off rights. However, secured claims may be encroached upon if and to the extent the
reorganization committee deems that the claim exceeds the value of the secured assets.

The adoption of a Non-unanimous Reorganization requires the approval of creditors representing a
majority of the claims with voting rights. The claims with voting rights will generally be the claims
that are affected by the proposal and secured claims will only have voting rights for parts of the claim
that is not covered by the underlying value of the security provided for the claim.

Following the approval of a requisite majority, a Non-unanimous Reorganization must be sanctioned
by the court. The court may, in addition to reviewing whether procedural requirements have been
observed, review the fairness of the proposal. Such review will consider whether individual creditors
have been compensated to consent to the reorganization, the burden-sharing among the creditors and
whether creditors are worse off than if the debtor was instead subject to bankruptcy proceedings.

_Solvent Enforcement_

Enforcement of security normally requires that the pledgee files an application to the enforcement
authorities for the enforcement of the security. Certain types of security may, however, be enforced
without the involvement of the enforcement authority or a court, typically security established pursuant
to the Financial Collateral Act (lov om finansiell sikkerhetsstillelse) and charges over monetary claims.

Enforcement of a guarantee claim against a solvent guarantor will in principal require a final, legally
binding judgment by a court (unless the guarantee is made as an enforceable promissory note).
Thereafter the creditor may apply to the enforcement authorities for enforcement of his or her claim.

_Limitations on Guarantees and Security Interests_

A Norwegian private limited liability company’s legal capacity or ability to provide financial
assistance is limited by applicable law, including, but not limited to the mandatory provisions of
sections 8-7 and 8-10 of the Norwegian Limited Companies Act (aksjeloven) (the “Norwegian
Companies Act”). If any of these limitations apply to the financial assistance, such financial assistance
(in whole or in part) may be deemed to be invalid and the value of e.g. the underlying guarantee or
security interest may be significantly reduced or fall away all together.

Section 8-7 limits a Norwegian private limited liability company’s ability to grant financial assistance
in favor of its shareholders or any of its shareholders’ affiliates to its distributable reserves, unless such
financial assistance falls within one or more of the exemptions listed in section 8-7. These exemptions
include, inter alia, exemptions for financial assistance granted by a subsidiary to (i) its direct or indirect

##### 409


-----

Norwegian parent company and such parent’s Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that the
parent company is a Norwegian limited liability company and (ii) its direct or indirect foreign parent
company and such parent’s Norwegian and foreign subsidiaries, provided that such parent company
has decisive influence over the Norwegian company (i.e. typically owns more than 50 per cent of the
shares in the Norwegian company) and such financial assistance is in the economic interest of the
group of companies.

Pursuant to section 8-10 (1) of the Norwegian Companies Act, a Norwegian private limited liability
company may, as a starting point, only provide financial assistance in connection with the acquisition
of shares in itself or its direct or indirect parent company within the limits of its distributable reserves.
As of 1 January 2020 the regulations were amended to permit financial assistance (outside the limits
of its distributable reserves) from a Norwegian private limited liability company where the acquirer
will form part of that Norwegian company’s group following the acquisition (i.e. the acquirer
following the acquisition will have decisive influence over the Norwegian company (i.e. typically
having, as a result of an agreement or through the ownership of shares or other ownership interests in
the other company (directly or indirectly), (i) a majority of the voting rights in the company, or (ii) a
right to elect or remove a majority of the members of the board of directors of the company)) subject
to the following conditions:

- the acquirer is domiciled in an EU/EEA-country;

- the financial assistance is provided on customary commercial terms and principles (for instance
by way of an arm’s length guarantee- or security commission) and relate to fully paid-in shares;

- the financial assistance is approved by both the board of directors and at least two-thirds of the
votes cast and of the share capital represented at a general meeting of the Norwegian company
before the financial assistance is provided;

- the board of directors of the Norwegian company must ensure that a credit appraisal is carried
out with respect to the beneficiary of the financial assistance (i.e. typically the acquirer);

- the board prepares a report which _inter alia include the background for the proposal, terms_
related thereto, the price to be paid for the shares, an assessment of the company’s interest in
providing the financial assistance and the consequences as to the equity and liquidity of the
Norwegian company; the board shall prepare a declaration

- confirming that it is in the company’s interest to provide the financial assistance and that the
company will meet its legal requirements to sound equity and liquidity; and

- the report and the declaration must be enclosed with the summons to the general meeting
referred to above, will be public and shall without undue delay be filed with the Norwegian
Register of Business Enterprises (Foretaksregisteret) before the financial assistance is
provided.

Corporate benefit principles also apply in Norway and may, inter alia, impose a restriction on a
Norwegian company’s ability to offer a guarantee and provide security to or in favor of shareholders
or parties related to a shareholder in addition to the restrictions on financial assistance and
upstream/cross-stream guarantees and security described above.

_Creation and Perfection of Security Interests in Norway_

The validity and enforceability of any guarantee or security interest provided by a Norwegian company
will be subject to any Norwegian laws from time to time in effect relating to bankruptcy, liquidation,
insolvency, reorganization, administration, moratorium or dissolution and any other laws or legal
procedures affecting creditors’ rights in general and to any provision generally applicable under

##### 410


-----

Norwegian law with regard to the invalidation or revision of contracts and/or unfair contract terms.
Enforcement of a security interest created under Norwegian law may only take place in a manner
authorized by Norwegian law.

Norwegian law requires a statutory basis for establishing a security interest. The Norwegian Pledge
Act is the legal basis for most types of security which can be established pursuant to Norwegian law.
It is a general condition for establishing a security interest that the assets to be pledged are transferable.

It is not possible to validly create security over future monetary claims (including intercompany loan
receivables and bank accounts) unless the debtor is named and the contractual relationship in which
the monetary claims arise is identified at the time the security is granted.

The security will only be enforceable against third parties if appropriate steps to perfect the security
interest have been taken. Furthermore, under Norwegian law, the ranking of security interests is as a
main rule determined by the date on which they were perfected.

As a main rule, a secured creditor does not have a general step-in right to security assets in an
enforcement situation and agreements on enforcement cannot be validly entered into prior to the
occurrence of an event of default. Instead, enforcement must be sought through the Norwegian courts
or the Norwegian enforcement authorities. Also, for specific security assets, and under certain
circumstances, a creditor may take possession or directly enforce its rights upon enforcement. This
applies to security over receivables (such as trade receivables or bank account claims) whereby the
secured party may instruct the relevant debtor to pay the outstanding amounts directly to the secured
party instead of the pledgor.

The concept of a security trustee, as understood under U.S. law, does not exist under Norwegian law.
In Norway a security trustee would be considered to act as a security agent. It is however generally
recognized under Norwegian law that the security agent will be able to enforce the security and apply
enforcement proceeds towards repayment of the secured obligations. In order to commence any legal
action regarding a claim (for enforcement purposes or otherwise) against the debtor, the security agent
may be required to disclose to the court the identity of the creditors and have the creditors join in or
participate as claimants in the proceedings. It has been established by the Norwegian Supreme Court
that a bond trustee for an undisclosed number of noteholders can, based on the provisions in the
relevant bond terms or indenture, take legal action against the issuer on behalf of and in lieu of the
holders of the Notes without having to disclose the identity of the holders of the Notes. However, the
relevant Norwegian court would have to examine the relevant bond terms or indenture together with
the other relevant agreements relating to the Notes and this Offering to determine whether the trustee
would be able to act in such capacity.

**_Parallel Debt_**

There is no established concept of “trust,” “trustee” or “parallel debt” under Norwegian Law and as
such these concepts may not be recognized or enforced by Norwegian courts. Norwegian law does not
make any distinction between registered and beneficial ownership and if such distinction is made under
foreign law the beneficial owner will be deemed the owner under Norwegian law.

**Sweden**

The following is a brief description of certain insolvency law considerations in Sweden. The
descriptions below do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that
may affect a Guarantor in Sweden. Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be
initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal
advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations.

##### 411


-----

**_Applicable Insolvency Law_**

Certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden. Any insolvency proceedings
applicable to such Guarantor, including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad), will, as a matter
of Swedish law, be governed by Swedish insolvency law (lex fori concursus).

In addition, and as follows from the section “—EU Insolvency Law” below a Swedish party will in
principle be subject to insolvency proceedings covered by the EU Insolvency Regulation (which
includes all collective insolvency proceedings available under Swedish law in respect of bodies
corporate) if it has its COMI in Sweden. The COMI is presumed, in the case of a company or body
corporate, to be the place of its registration as a legal person. Accordingly, if the Swedish party is
registered in Sweden, Swedish courts will be entitled to open main insolvency proceedings against it
and apply the laws of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a debtor is in a Member State
(other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member
State (other than Denmark) may open “territorial insolvency proceedings” or, after the commencement
of main proceedings, “secondary insolvency proceedings,” in the event that such debtor possesses an
“establishment” in the territory of such other Member State.

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. konkurslag (1987:627)), if a Swedish company is unable
to rightfully pay its debts as they fall due and such inability is not merely temporary, it is deemed
insolvent and can be declared bankrupt following a bankruptcy petition filed with the competent district
court (Sw. tingsrätt) by the debtor or by a creditor of the debtor.

In the event of bankruptcy of a Swedish company the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy who
will work in the interests of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor’s assets and distributing
the proceeds among the creditors. The bankruptcy estate is deemed to constitute a separate legal entity.

The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s
creditors receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required
to safeguard the assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what
is best for all creditors. In general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor
as soon as possible and to distribute the proceeds. In the interim, the receiver will take over the
management and control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no
longer be entitled to represent the company (other than in its capacity as bankruptcy debtor (Sw.
_konkursgäldenär)) or dispose of the company’s assets._

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish
Rights of Priority Act (Sw. förmånsrättslag (1970:979)), as amended from time to time, which states
the order in which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings
competing claims have an equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the
debtor’s assets. However, preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other
creditors.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver
in bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing
contracts. A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy
proceedings or similar is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right
to fulfil the company’s obligations according to a contract). If the bankruptcy estate steps into the
contract and performance by the creditor is due, the creditor may demand that the bankruptcy estate
performs its newly assumed obligations as well or, if a grace period has been granted, request that the
bankruptcy estate, without unreasonable delay, provides acceptable security for its performance. If
performance by the creditor is not due, the creditor may request security where this is necessary in order
to protect it against loss. If the bankruptcy estate does not step into the contract within a reasonable time

##### 412


-----

after the creditor’s demand or if it does not comply with the creditor’s request to provide security, the
creditor may terminate the contract.

In the case of enforcement outside bankruptcy proceedings, in respect of real estate mortgages and
business mortgages (Sw. _företagshypotek) and (as relevant) assets in the possession of the relevant_
security provider, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order
from the Swedish Enforcement Authority or the court. Upon obtaining an enforcement order against a
debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim. In
respect of pledges over certain other types of assets, such as over shares, receivables, bank accounts,
trademarks and contractual rights, enforcement can be carried out by the security holder itself. A
provision granting the secured party or its agent such right of enforcement is typically included in any
pledge agreement between the pledgor and the secured party or its agent. The secured party is typically
entitled to enforce the security through a sale of the collateral. However, certain restrictions apply to
the procedure for such a sale. In general, when enforcing the security, the secured party is under a duty
of care in relation to the security provider and the security granted. The security provider should, if the
circumstances are not exceptional, be given prior notice of the contemplated enforcement and also of
the time and location of the sale. Furthermore, sufficient notice should be given to prospective
purchasers in order to create reasonable preconditions for a market price being obtained in the sale.
Where the secured party has been granted the right to enforce the security through a private sale, such
sale must be made to a party unaffiliated with the secured party unless the market price of the security
can be independently and objectively established and the security is sold at such price. Pledges over
receivables and other claims are, if the receivable or claim has fallen due, normally enforced through
the secured party collecting the payment as opposed to selling the receivable.

Enforcement of security in bankruptcy is also subject to certain restrictions. A holder of a real property
mortgage, a business mortgage or security over specific assets in the possession of the relevant security
provider may demand that the relevant assets are sold by the receiver in bankruptcy without undue
delay, provided that the underlying claim is not disputed or has been confirmed in a non-appealable
decision. This rule does however not apply to such assets as are necessary for the continuation of the
debtor’s business. The receiver in bankruptcy may thus postpone such sale if the receiver in bankruptcy
determines that the bankruptcy estate would either incur a considerable loss or that the implementation
of a public composition proceeding (Sw. offentligt ackord) would become substantially more difficult,
provided that a postponement is not unreasonable to the secured party. A secured party holding a
possessory pledge over moveable property (such as shares) may arrange for the sale of the moveable
property at a public auction (but not sell the moveable property privately unless the receiver in
bankruptcy consents). Such secured party must however give the receiver in bankruptcy an opportunity
to arrange payment of the debtor’s debt to the creditor in order to redeem the moveable property to the
bankruptcy estate, and the moveable property may not, without the consent of the receiver in
bankruptcy, be sold earlier than four weeks after the oath administration meeting (Sw.
_edgångssammanträde) held as a part of the bankruptcy proceedings. However, financial instruments_
and currency are exempt from the requirement for the receiver in bankruptcy’s consent. The secured
party may either sell such financial instruments or currency immediately or assume ownership (against
reduction of the secured debt with the market value of such assets or, if the market value of the assets
exceeds the outstanding debt, against repayment to the debtor of the surplus), provided that the
realisation is done in a commercially viable manner. Should the security granted consist of rights over
unlisted shares in a subsidiary of the debtor, the receiver in bankruptcy must still be given an opportunity
to redeem the shares prior to the sale or deduction.

**_Priority of Certain Creditors_**

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in
relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and
secured creditors, where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit
of payment before other creditors. There are two types of preferential rights: specific and general
preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor a

##### 413


-----

right to payment from such property. General preferential rights cover all property that belongs to the
insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not covered by specific preferential rights, and give
the creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims that do not carry any of the above mentioned
preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such claim (to the extent of such
excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other (unless subordinated). A
claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has entered into an agreement with the debtor
stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of bankruptcy, claims in relation to
the bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due to costs relating to the bankruptcy
(including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), have priority over claims in relation to the debtor.

**_Challengeable Transactions_**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and
subject to a time limit) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to the bankruptcy
estate or the company which is subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include,
among others, situations in which the debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to
one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors before the initiation of the relevant insolvency
proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a guarantee or security interest that was either not
stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without delay after such time
and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is considerable
compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of
payment.

In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made during
the three months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain
situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others,
situations where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related
party to the debtor such as a subsidiary or parent company.

**_Limitations on Enforceability Due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Reorganization Act (Sw. Lag (1996:764) om företagsrekonstruktion) provides companies facing
difficulties in meeting their payment obligations with an opportunity to resolve such without being
declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganisation may be presented to the court by the company
or a creditor of the company but a reorganisation order may only be granted subject to the company’s
approval. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months
from commencement but may, and often is, extended for several additional three-month-periods.

An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day to day activities and safeguards the
interests of creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business
except that, for important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of
reorganization, granting security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or
transferring, pledging or granting rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the
consent of the administrator is required. However, if the debtor fails to comply with the restrictions it
will not affect the validity of such actions taken (but may jeopardize the reorganisation).

The corporate reorganization proceedings do not have the effect of terminating contracts with the
debtor. The Reorganization Act, rather, contains specific rules that restrict termination of contracts due
to breaches of contractual obligations that occurred prior to the instigation of the reorganization and,
during the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of
business. However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot
pay a debt that fell due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may
only be granted should there be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in
respect of the debtor will be stayed. A moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or
enforcement of security during corporate reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in

##### 414


-----

the physical possession of the secured creditor or any agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is
the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited liability company where the share
certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent or with a Swedish law pledge over a loan
which is documented by a negotiable debt instrument (Sw. löpande skuldebrev).

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord),
which means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public
composition must meet certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors that are
allowed to vote, in respect of a sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such
public composition. Creditors with set off rights and secured creditors will not participate in the
composition unless they wholly or partly waive their set off rights or priority rights. Should the security
not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim will, however, be part of a composition.
A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition. The public composition is
binding on the proceedings.

**_Limitations on the Value of secured assets_**

Swedish security registration documents, such as business mortgage certificates (Sw.
_företagsinteckningsbrev) and mortgage certificates (Sw._ _pantbrev), indicates the maximum nominal_
amount that upon a forced sale of the underlying assets can be paid to the holders. In case the amount
of the relevant security registration document does not suffice to cover the secured claim, the holders
are entitled to an additional amount, which may not exceed 15 per cent of the amount of such security
registration document. A secondary security holder (Sw. andrahandspant) is however not entitled to
any additional amount. The holders will not have a secured claim in any proceeds from such forced sale
that exceeds the entitled amount of the relevant security registration document. If the proceeds from
such forced sale is less than the entitled amount, the holders will only have an unsecured claim against
the remaining assets (if any) of that company.

**_Liquidation Due to Capital Deficiency_**

Pursuant to the Swedish companies act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)), as amended (the “Swedish
_Companies_ _Act”), whenever a company’s board of directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of_
losses or reductions in the value of the company’s assets or any other event, the company’s equity is
less than half the registered share capital, the company’s board of directors shall prepare a special
balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansräkning) and have the auditors examine it. The same obligation arises
if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish Enforcement Code
(Sw. utsökningsbalken (1981:774)) is found to lack seizeable assets.

If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the registered share
capital, the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice of a shareholders’ meeting which
shall consider whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special
balance sheet and an auditor’s report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’
meeting.

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date
of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial
shareholders’ meeting has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’
meeting shall, within eight months of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue whether the
company shall go into liquidation (second shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’
meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed
by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet and an auditor’s report thereon shall be
presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish
Companies Registration Office (Sw. _Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the_

##### 415


-----

shareholders not resolve on 255 such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second
shareholders’ meeting is not held within the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance
sheet which was presented at the second shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s
auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least
the registered share capital), the court may put the company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a
liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control of the company and shall sell the
company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The liquidator shall give notice to
the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims with the liquidator
within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

**_Limitations on the Value of a Guarantee_**

_Corporate Benefit Rules_

A Swedish limited liability company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a parent or
sister company, unless they belong to the same group of companies and the parent company of that
group is domiciled within the EEA, or unless the loan, for which the guarantee is provided, is intended
to be used exclusively in the borrower’s business operations and the guarantee is provided for purely
commercial reasons.

If a Swedish limited liability company (a “Swedish Company”) provides any guarantee without
receiving sufficient corporate benefit in return, such guarantee will, according to the Swedish
Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) (the “Swedish Companies Act”), in whole or in part,
be considered a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only (i) to the extent there is sufficient
coverage for the restricted equity capital of the Swedish limited liability company after the distribution
(i.e., at the time the guarantee is provided) (where the aggregate amount available for distribution during
the period from the annual general meeting until the following year’s annual general meeting shall be
calculated on the basis of the balance sheet approved by the shareholders at the first annual general
meeting, taking into account changes in the restricted equity capital after such annual general meeting)
and (ii) if considered prudent by the Swedish limited liability company to undertake such distribution
after having taken into consideration the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope and risks
relating to the Swedish limited liability company’s business or the Swedish limited liability company’s
need to strengthen its balance sheet, liquidity or financial position in general. Where the Swedish limited
liability company is a parent company, the latter assessment is made also on a group level.

The Guarantees of the Guarantors incorporated in Sweden are limited in accordance with the above
restrictions relating to corporate benefit and are subject to limitation language limiting the liability of
such entities thereunder if required by the above restrictions relating to distribution of assets.

_Financial Assistance_

Further, the Swedish Companies Act prohibits a Swedish Company from providing a loan or a guarantee
for a loan that is provided to facilitate the acquisition of shares in the Swedish Company itself or in any
other member of the same Swedish group of companies (with the exception of its subsidiaries) and,
subject to certain exceptions, a Swedish Company may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a
parent or sister company, unless the parent company of the group, to which the company and such
parent or sister company belongs, is domiciled within the EEA.

**_Foreign Currency_**

Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than the local currency but the judgment
debtor has the right under Swedish law to pay the judgment debt, even though denominated in a foreign
currency, in the local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of payment.

##### 416


-----

**_Trust_**

Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to be
appointed. While Swedish law does not know the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee
that has been appointed under foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under
the laws governing such appointment, will be recognised and acknowledged in Sweden and that such
an appointed trustee may be able to claim and enforce or procure the enforcement of the rights of the
beneficiaries under the trust, subject to the terms of the relevant documents.

**_Parallel Debt_**

The concept of parallel debt arrangements is not generally recognised under Swedish law and any
agreement or document may not be enforceable to the extent it purports to effect such arrangements.

**_EU Insolvency Law_**

Pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) 2015/848 of 20 May 2015 on insolvency proceedings, (the “EU
_Insolvency Regulation”) the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in_
relation to a Guarantor in Sweden or any of its subsidiaries is the court of the Member State (other
than Denmark) where the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries has its “center of main interests” (as that
term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) (“COMI”).

There is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a Swedish
Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries has its “center of main interests” in the Member State in which it
has its registered office (however, the presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not
been moved to another Member State within a 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of
insolvency proceedings), Preamble 28 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main
interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of
its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by their parties”. In that respect, factors
such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company or any of its subsidiaries
conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s or
any of its subsidiaries’ creditors transact with the company may all be relevant in the determination
of the place where the company or any of its subsidiaries has its “center of main interests”.

If the “center of main interests” of a Swedish Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries is and will remain
located in the state in which it has its registered office, main insolvency proceedings in respect of the
Swedish Guarantor or such subsidiary under the EU Insolvency Regulation may be commenced in
such jurisdiction, and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types
of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation, with these
proceedings being governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e. the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction where
the court opening such main insolvency proceedings is located. Main insolvency proceedings opened
in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognised in the other Member
States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member
State. If the “center of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under
Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than
Denmark) have jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such debtor if it has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 3.10 of the EU Insolvency Regulation)
in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of
operations where the company carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and
goods. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in
the territory of such other Member State. If a Swedish Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries does not
have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction

##### 417


-----

to open proceedings in respect of a Swedish Guarantor or such subsidiary under the EU Insolvency
Regulation.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the
territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the
company has its center of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings
can only be opened in another Member State where the company has an establishment where either:
(a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the Member State in which the company’s center of
main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings
are opened at the request of a creditor that is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office
in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective
of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will always, subject to certain exemptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the
local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction for the insolvency proceedings of the
debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court
opening main proceedings and give the same effect to the order in the other relevant Member States
so long as no secondary proceedings have been opened there. The insolvency officeholder appointed
by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s
center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that Member
State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the company from that other Member
State), subject to certain limitations, so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that
other Member State or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open
insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the Company has assets.

In the event that a Swedish Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws
may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Swedish Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries.

**_Automatic release_**

Any security created over any Collateral by or pursuant to the Swedish security documents is likely not
valid and enforceable under Swedish law to the extent it could be released, including in connection with
a transaction that is permitted, pre-agreed or similar (including, but not limited to, any release,
amalgamation, merger, consolidation, dissolution, re-designation, disposal, reorganisation or reduction
of capital) without the prior written consent (in its sole discretion on a case-by-case basis) of the Security
Agent, other than following a full discharge of the obligation secured by the relevant security document

**The Netherlands**

_General_

Under Dutch law, the obligations of APCOA Parking Nederland B.V., which is incorporated under
Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantor”), may be affected by (a) the standards of reasonableness and
fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid); (b) force majeure (niet toerekenbare
_tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden); and (c) the other general_
defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of the Notes. Other general defenses include claims that a security interest should be
voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van omstandigheden), fraud
(bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include suspension of
performance (opschorting), dissolution of contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening). Furthermore,
the courts of the Netherlands may change the effects of a contractual obligation on the basis of abuse of

##### 418


-----

authority (misbruik van bevoegdheid). Moreover, enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests
may be capable of being rescinded (vernietigd) as a result of lack of consensus ad idem (wilsgebreken)
and the legal consequences thereof.

A Dutch law governed security right may not be enforceable if and to the extent the corresponding
secured obligations have been modified in any material way at the time of enforcement of such security
right and such modified secured obligations are considered not to have been envisaged to be covered
by the security right at its creation.

The validity and enforceability of the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor under the Notes may be
successfully contested by such Dutch company (or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in suspension of
payments or its receiver (curator) in bankruptcy) on the basis of an ultra vires claim, which will be
successful if both (i) the obligations of the company do not fall within the scope of the objects clause
as set out in the company’s articles of association (doeloverschrijding) and (ii) the company’s
counterparty knew or ought to have known of this fact. In determining whether a transaction is in
furtherance of the objects and purposes of such Dutch company, a court will consider (i) the text of
the objects clause in the company’s articles of association and (ii) all relevant circumstances including
whether the transaction is in the company’s corporate interests (vennootschappelijk belang) and to its
benefit and whether the company’s subsistence is jeopardized by the granting of such security interest.
The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly reflected in such Dutch company’s
objects clause may not be conclusive evidence that such legal act is not ultra vires.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may
be suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam
(Ondernemingskamer van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) or its appointed temporary managing
director on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such company or
shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser
amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share
capital of at least €22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of
the shares in such company or, provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares or
depositary receipts issued therefor with a value of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as
provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union, other entities or persons entitled
thereto in the articles of association of, or in an agreement with, the relevant Dutch company as well
as the company itself may also submit a motion to the Enterprise Chamber for this purpose. The
guarantee or security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber or its appointed
temporary managing director, yet actual payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

To the extent Dutch law applies, any creditor of the Dutch Guarantor (or, after adjudication of
bankruptcy, its its receiver) may nullify any legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor under
certain circumstances, if (i) any legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor was conducted without
prior existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht), (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of
the Dutch Guarantor’s bankruptcy, any of its creditors was prejudiced as a consequence of such legal
act (irrespective of whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such legal act) and (iii) at the time
of any legal act entered into by the Dutch Guarantor was conducted, the Dutch Guarantor and, unless
the legal acts were conducted for no or next to no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or
should have known that one or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced
_(actio pauliana)._

A receiver in bankruptcy may nullify a legal act on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent
debtor’s creditors, and the burden of proof of the abovementioned elements of fraudulent conveyance
in principle rests on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is however presumed by law for certain
transactions performed within a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy.

##### 419


-----

This is applicable for certain transactions only, the most important application being in cases where
the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those of the other party, the satisfaction of existing
obligations of the bankrupt which are not yet due, and acts between the bankrupt and its counterparty
when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the bankrupt and its
counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions outside of a bankruptcy apply _mutatis mutandis_ when invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a legal
actif it was conducted on the basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte
_rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted at a time when the counterparty knew that a_
request for bankruptcy had been filed, or (ii) if such transaction was conducted as a result of
deliberation (bedriegelijk overleg) between the debtor and the counterparty with a view to giving
preference to the counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any
such transactions conducted by a Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a
challenge would be successful.

In the event the Dutch Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws
may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Dutch Guarantor.

Pursuant to the Collection of Taxes Act 1990 (Invorderingswet 1990) the Dutch tax authorities
(Belastingdienst) are entitled to attach, take into possession and sell (in principle by way of public
auction) certain moveable goods of the debtor or third parties for the recovery of a limited category of
tax debts. In general this right of the Dutch tax authorities (bodem (voor)recht) can be pursued against
those movable assets that are essential for the continuation of the business of the debtor, mainly
meaning equipment and inventory (but not stock) (bodemzaken). The above described right of the
Dutch tax authorities can be pursued for a limited category of tax debts, the most important being
debts for paying VAT and wage withholding tax. If the relevant goods are pledged, the pledgee must
act cautiously if a bankruptcy of a debtor is to be expected. If the relevant assets are still in the physical
possession of the debtor/pledgor at the date on which the debtor is declared bankrupt, the tax
authorities have the right to claim the sale proceeds of the relevant assets, even though a valid pledge
has been created for the benefit of a pledgee. It should also be noted that beneficiaries of security
interests or other third parties that (wholly or partially) may be a beneficiary to assets located on the
taxpayer’s premises are obliged to notify the Dutch tax authorities of their intentions in relation to
exercising their rights in respect of such assets casu quo their intentions to perform any activities as a
result of which the assets can no longer be deemed to be located on the taxpayer’s premises. Upon
having notified the Dutch tax authorities, a four week waiting period commences during which period
the beneficiaries of security interests or other third parties that (wholly or partially) may be a
beneficiary to the property located on the taxpayer’s premises are not allowed to exercise their rights
and which waiting period ends on the date on which the Dutch tax authorities informs the notifying
parties of the fact that the Dutch tax authorities will not seize the collateral located on the taxpayer’s
premises. Upon having received such message from the Dutch tax authorities, the beneficiaries of
security interests or other third parties that (wholly or partially) may be a beneficiary to the property
located on the taxpayer’s premises are restricted to a four week period during which they may exercise
their rights.

**_Insolvency Laws_**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law. Accordingly, where the Dutch Guarantor has
their “centre of main interests” or an “establishment in the Netherlands,” they may be subject to Dutch
insolvency proceedings governed by subject to certain exceptions as provided for in the EU
Insolvency Regulation.

There are three applicable corporate insolvency regimes under Dutch law in relation to corporations:
(a) suspension of payments (surseance van betaling), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization
of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to continue as a going concern, (b) a private composition
(onderhands akkoord), which is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable
the debtor to continue as a going concern and (c) bankruptcy (faillissement), which is primarily
designed to liquidate and distribute the debtor’s assets to its creditors. Bankruptcy is the most
commonly used insolvency regime and may result in the transfer of parts of the company as a going
concern. A suspension of payments almost always results in the debtor’s bankruptcy. All insolvency
regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet). A general description of the
principles of those insolvency regimes is set out below. This general description is subject to the
proposals discussed under the heading “—Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial
_Distress due to the COVID 19 Pandemic” below._

Only the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it foresees that it
will be unable to continue to pay its debts as they fall due. Once the application has been filed, a court
will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more
administrators (bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive
suspension of payments, but it will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than
one quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more
than one third of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured,
non-preferential, creditors declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice
the creditors during a suspension of payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to
satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. The fact that the debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors
does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors can be satisfied to some extent
(for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a composition). Other
than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to two
months pursuant to Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (extendable by another period of up to
two months) imposed by court order, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, nonpreferential creditors. During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s
consent (i) claim the asset subject to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the
debtor subject to a suspension of payments or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy
can be requested by a creditor of the debtor or the holder of a security interest over a claim from such
creditor, when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the creditor requesting
bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. Bankruptcy can also be declared in
certain circumstances when a debtor is subject to a suspension of payments. The debtor can also
request the application of bankruptcy proceedings itself, provided it has obtained prior approval of its
general meeting to file an application for its bankruptcy. The articles of association of the debtor can
preclude the necessity of such general meeting approval. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service
(het Openbaar Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public
interest (openbaar belang). As a consequence of the opening of bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor
will lose the power to manage and dispose of its assets with retroactive effect from 00.00 hours on the
day of the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings. Only the receiver is entitled to manage and dispose
of the debtor’s assets from that moment onwards. In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets

##### 421


-----

are generally liquidated and the proceeds distributed to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative
priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain creditors’ claims have equal priority, in
proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured creditors, will benefit from
special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their rights separately
from suspension of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs;
however, enforcement of the security interest might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of
execution of up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court
order pursuant to Article 63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (which may be a total period of eight
months if the similar statutory stay of execution under Article 241a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(referred to above) is first applied during suspension of payments), which has the same effects as set
forth above for stays of execution in suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a
secured party to foreclose its security interest within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver
pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to
sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to the secured party after a deduction of
liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned to the company’s receiver
and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured
creditors are generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and
bankruptcy proceedings against the Dutch Guarantor would allow secured creditors (and in case of
suspension of payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to
satisfy their claims by proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no
bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months,
extendable by another period of up to two months, may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain
preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike secured creditors, preferred creditors
are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority in the distribution of the
proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security interests may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights
must be respected. These may include secured creditors and tax and social security authorities.

A statutory stay of enforcement of security rights and other rights as described above of up to a
maximum of four months (two months extendable by another period of up to two months) may be
imposed by the relevant Dutch court ex officio or upon the request of any interested party. Further, a
receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured creditor to enforce its security interest within a reasonable
period of time. If such time is not met, the receiver will be entitled to sell the secured assets, if any,
and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds, meaning that the
secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant.

Excess proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be off set
against an unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set off may be allowed prior to the
bankruptcy, although at that time it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent conveyance
or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set off.

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when
suspension of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In
addition, all attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of
payments having become definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration
of bankruptcy (as the case may be) subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such
termination. Litigation pending on the date of the bankruptcy order is automatically stayed. Under
Dutch law, bankruptcy and suspension of payment generally take effect at 00.00 a.m. on the day of
the judgment of the bankruptcy or the suspension of payments.

##### 422


-----

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered
to creditors. A composition will be adopted if it is: (i) approved by a simple majority (gewone
_meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting, representing at least_
50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and (ii)
subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Consequently, Dutch insolvency law could
preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a restructuring and could reduce the
recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding or bankruptcy. Interest
accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted, cannot be claimed
in a composition.

All unsecured and non-preferential pre bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency
proceedings in order to be entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to
distributions. As a general rule, claims of unsecured and non-preferential creditors will have to be
submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy to be verified. If the bankruptcy has ended with a composition,
a claim that has not been submitted for verification within the deadline set therefore can no longer be
enforced. Any remaining funds will be distributed to the company’s shareholders. “Verification”
under Dutch law means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim
for voting purposes is determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured and non-preferential
pre bankruptcy claims are submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy for verification, and the receiver in
bankruptcy then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and whether
and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting).

In the situation of bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims
will be referred to a claim validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount
and rank of the disputed claim, while in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed
claim will be treated for voting purposes. These procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover
less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they could recover in a U.S. liquidation
proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders of Notes to be delayed.
Interest on the Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless secured by a
pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria. To the extent that an interest
is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive any rights from the
admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a bankruptcy.

Creditors of secured claims, such as the holders of the Notes, and preferential creditors with respect
to certain assets of a debtor, who expect that the proceeds of a future enforcement against the assets
subject to the security or their preferred rights, as the case may be, will be insufficient to satisfy their
claim in full, may request to receive the same rights as unsecured and non-preferential creditors with
respect to the expected remainder of their claim, with preservation of their rights as a secured or
preferential creditor in respect of the secured asset or the asset the relevant preferential right relates
to. If a secured creditor enforces its security rights prior to the expiry of the period for submitting
claims for verification, and the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to satisfy its claim in
full, the remainder of that claim may be submitted to the receiver in bankruptcy in order to be verified.

Under Dutch law, it is uncertain as to whether security interests can be granted to a party other than
the creditor of the claim which is purported to be secured by such security interests. As a consequence,
the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provides for the creation of parallel debt (Parallel Debt)
obligations in favor of the Security Agent mirroring the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors
towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the Principal Obligations).
The Dutch law security interests are, and will be, granted to the Security Agent as security for the
Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. The Parallel Debt will be at all
times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment

##### 423


-----

in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of
the security interest granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct
security and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security except through
the Security Agent. As a result, the holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt concept has not been
tested under Dutch supreme court case law and, to the extent that the security interests in the collateral
created to secure the Parallel Debt are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes
will not (directly) receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the collateral.
However, the mechanism of Parallel Debt is commonly accepted and applied in the Dutch market.

As regards the private composition regime, as of January 1, 2021, debtors having their “centre of
main interests” in the Netherlands have the possibility to offer a composition outside of formal
insolvency proceedings under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans
(Wet homologatie onderhands akkoord) (“Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring
Plans”). The private composition regime has been incorporated in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act pursuant
to this Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans. Unlike a composition in
suspension of payments and in bankruptcy, a composition under the Act on Court Confirmation of
Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can be offered to secured creditors as well as shareholders. The Act
on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides, inter alia, for cross class
cramdown, the restructuring of group company obligations through either one or more aligned
proceedings, the termination of onerous contracts with deactivation of ipso facto- and change of
control clauses, and supporting court measures. Such composition may result in claims against the
Dutch Guarantor being compromised if the relevant majority of creditors within a class or a more
senior class vote in favor of such a composition. In addition to the aforementioned, a composition
plan can, inter alia, include the following elements: (a) a write-off or deferral of the (payment)
obligations of the debtor, (b) an amendment of the rights of (third) parties having recourse against the
debtor (such as guarantors or jointly liable parties), (c) a debt-for-equity swap (including, if required,
amending the debtor’s articles of association or any applicable shareholders agreement) and (c) the
termination or amendment of the terms of onerous contracts and any claims for damages resulting
therefrom

A composition plan under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans can
extend to claims against entities that are not incorporated under Dutch law and/or are residing outside
the Netherlands. Accordingly, the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans
can affect the rights of the Trustee and/or the holders of the Notes under the Indenture and therefore
the Notes.

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans voting on a composition
plan is done in classes. Approval by a class requires a decision adopted with a majority of two third
of the claims of that class that have voted on the plan or, in the case of a class of shareholders, two
thirds of the shares of that class that have voted on the plan. No headcount requirement applies. The
Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans provides for the possibility for a
composition plan to be binding on a non-consenting class (cross class cramdown). Under the Act on
Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court will confirm a composition plan if
at least one class of creditors (other than a class of shareholders) that can be expected to receive a
distribution in case of a bankruptcy of the debtor approves the plan, unless there is a statutory ground
for refusal. The court can, inter alia, refuse confirmation of a composition plan on the basis of (i) a
request by an affected creditor of a consenting class if the value of the distribution that such creditor
receives under the plan is lower than the distribution it can be expected to receive in case of a
bankruptcy of the debtor or (ii) a request of an affected creditor of a non-consenting class, if the plan
provides for a distribution of value that deviates from the statutory or contractual ranking and priority
to the detriment of that class.

##### 424


-----

Under the Act on Court Confirmation of Extrajudicial Restructuring Plans, the court may grant a stay
on enforcement of a maximum of 4 months, with a possible extension of 4 months. During such period,
_inter alia, all enforcement action against the assets of (or in the possession of) the debtor is suspended,_
including action to enforce security over the assets of the debtor. Accordingly, during such stay a
pledgee of claims may not collect nor notify the debtors of such pledged claims of its rights of pledge.

**_Emergency Legislation to Protect Enterprises in Financial Distress Due to the COVID 19 Pandemic_**

The Dutch Parliament has recently adopted emergency legislation regarding a temporary suspension
of enforcement and other measures in support of enterprises during the COVID 19 pandemic (Tijdelijke
_wet COVID 19 SZW en JenV). The emergency legislation provides for a court ordered moratorium and_
several related protections which apply until at least August 1, 2021 and can, if and when necessary,
be extended beyond that date for two month periods at a time.

The measures of the legislation apply to enterprises (other than certain specific regulated entities)
whose continuity is threatened due to the COVID 19 pandemic. In response to a request from creditors
(other than the Dutch Tax Authorities) to declare the enterprise bankrupt or initiate the execution or
seizure of assets, the enterprise/debtor can request the court to grant a moratorium vis-à-vis those
creditors of up to two months (which may be extended twice at the request of the enterprise/debtor by
periods of up to two months at a time), and if such moratorium is granted by the court then during
such period:

(i) the bankruptcy petition is stayed;

(ii) payment obligations to those creditors are suspended, and any prior default does not, in and of
itself, provide a legal basis to change the terms or suspend performance of, or terminate, an
agreement with those creditors; and

(iii) if the court so decides, conservatory and executory attachments by those creditors are
suspended, and no other enforcement measures can (continue to) be taken by those creditors
against the assets of their debtor without the prior approval of the court.

The measures referred to in (iii) can also be requested in summary proceedings and attachments can
be terminated as part of such proceedings. It is important to note that any measure of the court only
affects those creditors who requested the bankruptcy or initiated the execution or seizure of assets of
the debtor. However, any request by other creditors will most likely result in the court taking the same
decisions.

When considering the request to apply the measures discussed above, the court will need to establish
that the enterprise/debtor has made it plausible that, solely or mainly due to the outbreak of the COVID
19 pandemic, the enterprise has not been able to continue its business as usual and as a result has
temporarily become unable to pay its debts when they fall due. Creditors not covered by the
moratorium retain these rights vis à vis their debtor. The enterprise/debtor is in any event presumed to
be in this position if it can provide financial information that shows that prior to the outbreak of the
COVID 19 pandemic or the restrictive measures announced since March 15, 2020 (i) it had sufficient
liquidity to satisfy its due and payable debts, and (ii) its revenue decreased by at least 20% compared
to the average revenue in the preceding three months. The court will further need to conclude that
following the moratorium the enterprise/debtor will be able to satisfy its debts and that the creditor(s)
that are affected are not significantly and unreasonably prejudiced as a result of the moratorium. When
granting a moratorium, the court can take any measures it considers necessary to ensure the interests
of the creditor(s) are not prejudiced.

##### TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

The following restrictions will apply to the Notes and the Note Guarantees (the “Securities”). You are
advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or transfer of any of the
Securities.

None of the Securities have been registered under the Securities Act, and the Securities may not be
offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not
subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.
Accordingly, the Securities are only being offered and sold (A) to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A
and (B) outside the U.S. in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Securities will be deemed to have acknowledged, represented and agreed with us and
the Initial Purchasers as follows (terms used in this paragraph that are defined in Rule 144A or
Regulation S under the Securities Act are used herein as defined therein):

(1) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account or for an account with respect to which it
exercises sole investment discretion and that it and any such account is either (A) a QIB, and is
aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance on Rule 144A or (B) outside the United States;

(2) it acknowledges that the Securities are being offered for resale in a transaction not involving a
public offering in the United States (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and have not
been registered under the Securities Act or any other securities laws and may not be reoffered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred within the United States;

(3) it shall not offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Securities except (A) to the Issuer or
any of its subsidiaries, (B) inside the United States to a QIB in a transaction complying with
Rule 144A, (C) outside the United States in an offshore transaction in compliance with
Regulation S under the Securities Act, (D) pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act (if available), (E) in accordance with another exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or (F) pursuant to an effective
registration under the Securities Act. It acknowledges that no representation is made as to the
availability of the exemption provided by Rule 144A for resale of the Securities;

(4) it agrees that it will give to each person to whom it transfers the Securities notice of any
restrictions on transfer of such Securities;

(5) it is relying solely on the information contained in this Offering Memorandum in making its
investment decision with respect to the Securities. It acknowledges that neither we nor the
Initial Purchasers have made any representation to it with respect to us or the offering or sale
of any Securities, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum which
has been delivered to it and upon which it is relying in making its investment decision with
respect to the Securities. It has had access to such financial and other information concerning
us and the Securities as it has deemed necessary in connection with its decision to purchase the
Securities, including an opportunity to ask questions of and request information from us and
the Initial Purchasers;

(6) it acknowledges that prior to any proposed transfer of Securities in certificated form or of
beneficial interests in a Global Note (in each case other than pursuant to an effective registration
statement), the holder of Securities or the holder of beneficial interests in a Global Note, as the
case may be, may be required to provide certifications and other documentation relating to the
manner of such transfer and submit such certifications and other documentation as provided in
the Indenture;

(7) it understands that all of the Securities will bear a legend to the following effect unless
otherwise agreed by us and the holder thereof:

##### 426

##### PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

The Issuer, the Guarantors and Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, NatWest Markets N.V. and Deutsche Bank
Aktiengesellschaft (the “Initial Purchasers”), have entered into a purchase agreement dated on or around
the date of this Offering Memorandum with respect to the Notes (the “Purchase Agreement”).

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer has agreed to sell to
the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire
principal amount of the Notes.

The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to
purchase Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint.

**General**

The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the respective issue prices that
appear on the cover of this Offering Memorandum for each of the Fixed Rate Notes and the Floating
Rate Notes. After the initial Offering, the Initial Purchasers may change the price at which the Notes
are offered and any other selling terms at any time without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and
sell Notes in the United States through certain of their affiliates or through U.S. registered brokerdealers. To the extent the Initial Purchasers intend to make any offers or sales of the Notes in the United
States, or to nationals or residents of the United States, they will do so only through one or more
registered broker-dealers in compliance with applicable securities laws and regulations, as well as with
applicable laws of the various states.

In the Purchase Agreement, we have agreed that:

- the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject
to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by their counsel and our
counsel; and

- the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and
will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be
required to make in respect of those liabilities.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
issue price set forth on the cover page hereof.

**Professional investors and ECPs (as defined below) only target market: Solely for the purposes of**
each manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to
the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties (“ECPs”) and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii)
all channels for distribution of the Notes to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II
is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either
adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a
retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning
of Directive 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would

##### 429


-----

not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**Prohibition Of Sales To UK Retail Investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or**
otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who
is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”);
or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU)
2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article
2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms
part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may
be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**Securities Not Being Registered under the Securities Act**

The Notes and the Note Guarantees have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act
and may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and
outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this
paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as
described under “Transfer Restrictions.” Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements as described under “Transfer
_Restrictions.” In addition, an offer or sale of Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not_
participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the
dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration
under the Securities Act.

**Other Jurisdictions**

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA or in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from
the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. The expression “Prospectus Regulation”
means Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended or superseded), and includes any relevant
implementing measure in the UK or in the Member State concerned, if applicable. References to
Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the UK, those Regulations or Directives as they form
part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or have been
implemented in UK domestic law, as appropriate.

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: it has complied and
will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation
to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the UK; and it has only communicated or caused to be
communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement
to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA
does not apply to the communication.

##### 430


-----

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the UK, by us or the Initial
Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution
of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where
action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or
indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in
connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except
in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This
Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in
any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this
Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions
relating to the offering of the Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the
Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Resale Restriction**

The Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell,
pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such
offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer
and sale of the Notes.

**Market Making and Stabilization**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing
transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the Offering
size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to
purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the
Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate
covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the
absence of those transactions. These transactions may include short sales and purchases on the open
market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of
a greater principal amount of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. The Initial
Purchasers must close out any short position by purchasing notes in the open market. A short position
is more likely to be created if the Initial Purchasers are concerned that there may be downward pressure
on the price of the notes in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who
purchase in the offering. If the Initial Purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering
transactions, they may discontinue them at any time.

Similar to other purchase transactions, the Initial Purchasers’ purchases to cover the syndicate short
sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the Notes or preventing a decline
in the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the Notes may be higher than the price that
might otherwise exist in the open market.

Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or
magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes. In
addition, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Initial Purchasers
will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued
without notice.

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the
Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under
“Transfer Restrictions.” We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange
other than the Official List of the Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation
system. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, as

##### 431


-----

permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the
Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the
Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the
limits imposed by the Securities Act, and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“U.S.
Exchange Act”). Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it
will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or at a
price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes and Our Capital
_Structure—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell_
_the Notes may be limited.”_

**Initial Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the      business day
following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+    “). Under
Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle
in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly,
purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the
next      successive business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will
settle in T+     , to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own
advisor.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates from time to time have performed, may currently perform
and/ or in the future may perform, various banking activities (including, amongst others, securitization
programs, cash pooling, hedging, agency and/or other banking products or services as well as related
credit lines), investment banking, advisory, consulting and other financial services for the Parent and
its affiliates, for which they may receive customary advisory and transaction fees and reimbursement
of expenses. In particular, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, National Westminster Bank plc and Deutsche
Bank Aktiengesellschaft (or their affiliates) are lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch acts as facility agent under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
Security Agent under the New Revolving Facility Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indenture. In addition, certain affiliates of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft will act as Trustee, Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent, Calculation Agent and Registrar under the Indenture. Furthermore, certain of
the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may assist the Issuer and its affiliates with the management of
foreign currency exchange risk with corresponding credit lines. In addition, a portion of the proceeds
from the issuance of the Notes in this Offering will be used to repay the Existing Term Loans, under
which certain Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates act as arrangers, lenders and/or agents.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates
may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of ours or our affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship
with us or our affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of
those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge and certain of those Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering
into transactions that consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views

in respect of the Issuer, such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients
that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

##### SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
England, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. In addition, one of the third party security
providers is organized under the laws of Luxembourg. None of the directors, officers or other executives
of the Issuer and the Guarantors are residents of the United States. You may be unable to effect service
of process within the United States on the directors, officers or executives of the Issuer and the
Guarantors. It may also not be possible for investors to effect service of process within Germany upon
the Issuer, the Guarantors or those persons under the Hague Convention on Service Abroad of Judicial
and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 and the German
law implementing such convention if such service were deemed to infringe German sovereignty or
security, which may be the case if such service violated the substantial foundations of German law, in
particular the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz). In addition, as the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ assets
and the assets of our and their directors, officers and other executives are located outside of the United
States, you may be unable to enforce against them or us judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated
on civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

**Germany**

We have been advised by our German counsel that there is doubt as to the enforceability in Germany
of civil liabilities based on federal or state securities laws of the United States, either in an original
action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state courts. The United States
and the Federal Republic of Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial
matters. The enforceability of final judgments therefore may depend on the laws of the relevant U.S.
state and federal laws of the United States. Consequently, a final judgment for payment given by any
federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal
or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil
Procedure (Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally will not reinvestigate the
merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court, except as noted below.

German courts will, in particular, not recognize and enforce such judgments if the judgment is not final
under applicable U.S. federal or state law or if any of the reasons for excluding enforceability set forth
in section 328(1) of the German Code of Civil Procedure exist:

- if, pursuant to German law, the U.S. federal or state court having rendered the foreign judgment
did not have jurisdiction;

- if process has not been duly served or has not been served in a timely fashion to permit a
defense, provided that the defendant did not actively participate in such process and pleads
accordingly;

- if the judgment is incompatible with a prior judgment rendered by a German court or by a
foreign court which is to be recognized in Germany;

- if the judgment, or the proceeding resulting in the judgment, to be recognized is incompatible
with a proceeding in Germany which was pending (rechtshängig) before a German court before
the U.S. federal or state court entered its judgment;

- if a recognition of the judgment would be obviously incompatible with essential principles of
German law (public policy), in particular, if the recognition would be incompatible with the
civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz); or

##### 434


-----

- if reciprocity is not ensured (i.e., the U.S. federal or state courts would not recognize and
enforce a comparable judgment by a German court in equivalent circumstances).

Subject to the foregoing, holders of the Notes may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. There is some German case law to the
effect that reciprocity of the recognition of judgments is ensured in relation to claims relating to assets
(vermögensrechtliche Ansprüche) with regard to various U.S. states. We cannot, however, assure you
that attempts to enforce judgments in Germany will be successful. It is also doubtful whether a German
court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original action solely predicated by U.S.
federal securities laws.

In addition, the recognition and enforcement of punitive damages are usually denied by German courts
as incompatible with the essential principles of German law. Moreover, a German court may reduce the
amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that they are
necessary to compensate actual losses or damages.

Consequently, judgments awarding monetary damages under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S.
federal securities laws may not be enforceable to the extent they provide for a compensation that would
qualify as being of a penal or punitive nature.

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. In so
far as the production of evidence is concerned, U.S. law and the laws of several other jurisdictions based
on common law provide for pretrial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may, prior
to trial, compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and/or the deposition of
witnesses. Evidence obtained in this matter may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such
pretrial discovery process exists under German law.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new lawsuit in a competent court
in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment rendered in the United
States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United States against the
Issuer or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of the
dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may
render a judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

In addition, it may under certain circumstances also not be possible for investors to effect service of
process within Germany upon the German Guarantors or those persons under the Hague Convention on
the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of
November 15, 1965 and the German law implementing such convention if such service were deemed
to infringe German sovereignty or security, which may be the case if such service violated the
fundamental principles of German law, in particular the civil rights (Grundrechte) guaranteed by virtue
of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). However, the German Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) held in 2013 that service may not be denied solely because the action before
the U.S. court contains claims for punitive damages.

**Austria**

According to the Austrian Enforcement Act (Federal Law Gazette No. 79/1896 as last amended by
Federal Law Gazette I No. 86/2021; _Exekutionsordnung — EO), foreign judgements are only_
enforceable in Austria if the reciprocity is warranted by a bilateral or multilateral treaty between the
countries involved or by an ordinance (Verordnung) of the Austrian government (in which ordinance
the Austrian government confirms the reciprocity). The Republic of Austria and the United States have
not entered into a treaty regarding the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements rendered
in either courts in civil and commercial matters. There is also no applicable ordinance of the Austrian
government in place. Therefore, the courts of Austria will not recognize and/or enforce a judgement
obtained in the courts of the United States, be it a judgement rendered by a United States federal or state

##### 435


-----

court. Accordingly, the subject matter upon which a judgement has been obtained in a United States
federal or state court must be re-litigated before Austrian courts in accordance with applicable Austrian
Civil Procedure Laws (Zivilprozessverfahren) and Austrian courts will regard such judgement as
evidence of the outcome of the dispute only. Only after having obtained a final judgement before
Austrian courts can enforcement procedures be initiated under the Austrian Enforcement Act.

The United Kingdom is a party to the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements of June 30,
2005, so it is applicable, but the jurisdiction regime is very limited – it only applies to contracts in which
exclusive jurisdiction in civil and commercial matters is agreed and no consumer is involved. Therefore,
if a judgment is issued by a UK court specified in an agreement on jurisdiction, it can no longer be
enforced under the Brussels Ia-Regulation but under the 2005 Hague Convention.

**Belgium**

In the absence of any applicable bilateral or multilateral treaty, a final and enforceable judgment of the
courts exercising jurisdiction in the United States would be recognized and enforced by the courts of
Belgium without review on the merits subject to the conditions specified in Articles 22 to 25 of the
Belgian Code of Private International Law (Wetboek van Internationaal Privaatrecht/Code de Droit
_International Privé)._

Pursuant to Article 24 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the following documents must
be produced in court by the claimant:

- an official copy of the judgment (uitgifte van de beslissing/expédition de la décision) fulfilling
all conditions required for its authentication under the applicable foreign law;

- if obtained by default, an original or legalized copy of the document demonstrating that the
originating process has been served on the defendant in accordance with the applicable foreign
law or an equivalent document in accordance with the applicable foreign law demonstrating
that the judgment was served or notified to the party that did not appear; and

- any document demonstrating that, under the applicable foreign law, the judgment is enforceable
and has been notified to the defendant.

However, recognition and enforcement can be refused in the circumstances described in Article 25 of
the Belgian Code of Private International Law, and notably if:

- the rights of defense have been violated;

- such recognition or enforcement would be manifestly incompatible with Belgian public policy;

- the jurisdiction of the foreign judge was based solely on the presence of the defendant or assets
without any direct connection with the dispute in the foreign state;

- without prejudice to Article 23.4 of the Belgian Code of Private International Law, the decision
may still be appealed under the applicable foreign law (however, provisional enforcement could
then be granted);

- if in relation to matters for which parties cannot freely dispose of their rights, the decision has
been sought with the sole purpose of escaping from the application of the laws applicable in
accordance with Belgian private international law;

- the claim was filed in the United States after the filing in Belgium of a claim that is still pending
between the same parties with respect to the same subject matter;

##### 436


-----

- the judgment is incompatible with a decision rendered in Belgium or a prior judgment rendered
in another jurisdiction that can be recognized in Belgium;

- Belgian jurisdictions have exclusive jurisdiction in respect of the claim; or

- the decision is in conflict with the rules on the recognition and enforcement of court decisions
in relation to inter alia insolvency proceedings or corporate standing.

As a general principle, procedural rules are governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the court (lex
_fori). In Belgium the procedural rules set out in, among others, the Belgian Judicial Code and the_
Belgian Code of Private International Law will apply when recognition and enforcement of judgments
rendered by United States courts is sought in Belgium.

In the case of an enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of foreign
court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable
by the debtor, if the sum of money that the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court judgment, or by
a foreign court judgment that is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii)
rendered enforceable by a Belgian court, exceeds €12,500. A nominal registration tax would be due on
the registration of bailiff deeds.

**Denmark**

The United States and the United Kingdom currently do not have a treaty with Denmark providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment obtained in any federal or state court in the United
States or in any court of the United Kingdom would neither be recognized nor enforceable in Denmark
without a review of the merits of the case. However, in any such proceedings taken in the Danish courts,
the Danish courts may give consideration to a final and conclusive judgment obtained in the United
States courts and the United Kingdom courts.

**England and Wales**

The United States and England and Wales currently do not have a treaty between them providing for
the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and
commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court
in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, would not automatically be recognized or directly enforceable in England and Wales. In order to
enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales, fresh proceedings must first be initiated before
a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales. In such an action, an English court would not
generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is
said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment on such a claim (assuming
that there is no good defense to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the English court can
dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by an English court in such an action may be conditional upon (among other things) the
following:

- the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English
conflicts of laws principles and rules of English private international law at the time when
proceedings were initiated (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction
according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the rules of English
private international law);

- the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause except
with the agreement of the relevant parties or the relevant parties’ subsequent submission to the
jurisdiction of the court;

##### 437


-----

- the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt for a definite sum of money;

- the recognition or enforcement, as the case may be, of the U.S. judgment not contravening
English public policy, the European Convention on Human Rights or English law including the
Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent
applicable);

- the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a nonEnglish penal or revenue law, or other public law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in
breach of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

- the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English principles of
natural justice;

- there not having been a prior inconsistent, determinative or conflicting judgment of an English
or other non-U.S. court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties and/or prior
inconsistent judgment given in a Hague Convention member state or other court which the
English Court must recognize and enforce under the Hague Convention Choice of Court
Agreements of June 30, 2005 and/or the Lugano Conventions of 1988 and 2007 or other law;

- the U.S. judgment not having been wholly satisfied or not being enforceable by execution in
the U.S.;

- the party seeking enforcement providing security for costs, if ordered to do so by the English
court; and

- the English enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales in civil and
commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot
assure you that those judgments will be recognized or enforceable in England and Wales. In addition,
it is questionable whether an English court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if
proceedings were commenced in England and Wales, instead of the United States, in an original action
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws or other laws. Further, it may not be possible to
obtain a judgment in England and Wales or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes
subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any setoff or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the
judgment debtor may raise any counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been
originally brought in England and Wales unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied
in the U.S. proceedings.

**Grand Duchy of Luxembourg**

A contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service agent could be
overridden by Luxembourg statutory provisions allowing the valid serving of process against a party
in accordance with applicable laws at the domicile of the party.

As there is no treaty in force on the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters between the United States and Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg
will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid
judgment against a company incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the transaction documents

##### 438


-----

obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full
force and effect after all appeals that may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with
respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent
jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set
forth in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de
_Procédure Civile), being:_

- the U.S. court has applied to the dispute the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg
conflict of laws rules or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those
rules. Based on recent case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still
be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court;

- the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws;

- the U.S. court order or judgment must not result from an evasion of Luxembourg law (fraude
_à la loi);_

- the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matters under
its applicable rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg private international
law;

- the judgment is enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction in which the decision has been
rendered;

- the judgment was obtained in compliance with the rights of the defendant, i.e., following
proceedings at which the defendant had the opportunity to appear, was granted the necessary
time to prepare its case and, if it appeared, could present a defense; and

- the judgment does not contravene international public policy as understood under the laws of
Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature.

If an original action is brought in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse
to apply the designated law and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg’s international
public policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws,
Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an exequatur
may be refused in respect of punitive damages. Furthermore, in the event of any proceedings being
brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a
currency other than euro, a Luxembourg court would have the power to give judgment expressed as
an order to pay in a currency other than euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party
in Luxembourg would be available only in euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be
converted into euro.

Furthermore, a foreign jurisdiction clause does not prevent the parties from initiating legal action in
Luxembourg courts to the extent that summary proceedings (référé) seeking urgent provisional
measures are concerned. Finally, notwithstanding a foreign governing law clause, Luxembourg courts
would in principle have jurisdiction over any urgent provisional measures in connection with assets
located in Luxembourg and such action would most likely be governed by Luxembourg law.

**Italy**

Recognition and enforcement in Italy of final judgments rendered by U.S. courts, including judgments
obtained in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities
laws, may not require retrial and will be enforceable in Italy, provided that pursuant to Article 64 of
Italian Law No. 218 of 31 May 1995 (Riforma del sistema italiano di diritto internazionale privato),
amongst others, the following conditions are met:

##### 439


-----

- the U.S. court which rendered the final judgment had jurisdiction according to Italian law
principles of jurisdiction;

- the relevant summons and complaint was appropriately served on the defendants in accordance
with U.S. law and during the proceedings the essential rights of the defendant have not been
violated;

- the parties to the proceeding appeared before the court in accordance with U.S. law or, in the
event of default by the defendant, the U.S. court declared such default in accordance with U.S.
law;

- the judgment is final and not subject to any further appeal in accordance with U.S. law;

- there is no conflicting final judgment rendered by an Italian court;

- there is no action pending in Italy amongst the same parties for decision on the same matter
which commenced prior to the action in the United States; and

- the provisions of such judgment would not violate Italian public policy (ordine pubblico).

In addition, pursuant to Article 67 of Italian Law No. 218 of 31 May 1995, if a judgment rendered by a
U.S. court is not complied with, its recognition is challenged or its compulsory enforcement is
necessary, then a proceeding shall be initiated before the competent Court of Appeal in the Republic of
Italy to that end. The competent Court of Appeal does not consider the merits of the case but exclusively
ascertains the fulfilment of all the conditions set out above.

In original actions brought before Italian courts, the enforceability of liabilities or remedies based solely
on the U.S. federal securities law is debatable. In addition, in original actions brought before Italian
courts, Italian courts may apply not only Italian rules of civil procedure, but also certain substantive
provisions of Italian law that are regarded as mandatory, and may refuse to apply U.S. law provisions
or grant some of the remedies sought if their application violates any Italian public policies and/or any
mandatory provisions of Italian law.

**Norway**

The Notes are governed by the laws of New York. There is no treaty between Norway and the United
States regarding the recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards). Thus,
a judgment from a U.S. federal or state court would as a main rule not be enforceable in Norway without
an independent review of the merits of the case. However, a final and conclusive judgment duly
rendered by certain U.S. courts or any other appellate court in the United States may be recognized and
enforced by the courts of Norway without further examination of the merits of the case, provided that
the U.S. proceedings and the judgment itself fulfill the conditions stated in the Norwegian Enforcement
Act of 1992 No. 86 (Tvangsfullbyrdelsesloven) and the Norwegian Dispute Act of 2005 No. 90
(Tvisteloven). Generally, this means that, a judgment duly rendered by a U.S. court will be recognized
and enforced by the courts of Norway, only if (i) the respective parties thereto have submitted in writing
to the jurisdiction of the relevant U.S. court and, in the case of an agreement between a consumer and
trader, such agreement is entered into after the dispute arose; (ii) the judgment obtained is final and
enforceable in and pursuant to the laws of the relevant U.S. court; and (iii) the recognition and
enforcement of the judgment will not be in conflict with decency or Norwegian mandatory law or public
policy.

**Sweden**

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of December 12, 2012 on the jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in
civil and commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels Regulation”), a judgment entered against a

##### 440


-----

company in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e., all Member States of the European
Union) and which is enforceable in such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden without
any declaration of enforceability being required. The applicant will need to provide the competent
enforcement authority, in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. _Utsökningsbalk_
1981:774), with a copy of the judgment and a certificate certifying that the judgment is enforceable, as
further described in the Brussels Regulation. However, upon an application against the enforcement
pursuant to the Brussels Regulation the court with which the application is lodged may refuse
enforcement.

With regard to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil
and Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a company in the
courts of a Contracting State (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a
state, will be directly enforceable in Sweden provided that the concerned party has submitted an
application for declaration of enforceability to the appropriate Swedish district court (Sw. tingsrätt) and
comply with the proceedings of that court and, if the judgment is declared enforceable, apply to the
Swedish Enforcement Agency for enforcement in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw.
_Utsökningsbalk 1981:774) and comply with the relevant proceedings. Judgments entered against any_
Swedish party in the courts of a state that is not a Member State under the terms of the Brussels
Regulation or a Contracting State under the terms of the Lugano Convention (e.g., the United States),
would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of right without retrial on its merits. If
the party in whose favor the final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in Sweden,
the party may however submit to the Swedish court the final judgment that has been rendered in such
jurisdiction (e.g. the United States). A judgment by a court in such jurisdiction (e.g. the United States)
may be regarded by a court, administrative tribunal or executive or other public authority of Sweden as
evidence of the outcome of the dispute to which the judgment relates, and a Swedish court may in its
discretion choose to rehear the dispute ab initio. The same applies to a judgment obtained in the courts
of England against the Swedish Guarantor, which would be recognised and enforceable in Sweden in
accordance with and subject to the procedural steps and on the material conditions imposed by the 2005
Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements (the “Hague Convention”). Based on the
communication by the European Commission dated 27 August 2020, Swedish courts would likely give
effect to the Hague Convention as the applicable source of law only in respect of exclusive choice of
court agreements concluded after 1 January 2021. As regards non-exclusive choice of court agreements
and exclusive choice of court agreements concluded prior to 1 January 2021, a judgment rendered by
an English court would not be enforceable nor recognized in Sweden.

**The Netherlands**

The Dutch Guarantor is incorporated under Dutch law and has its registered seat in the Netherlands.
The director of the Dutch Guarantor does not reside in the United States and a substantial amount of
the assets of the Dutch Guarantor is located outside of the United States.

As there is no enforcement treaty between the Netherlands and the United States of America.
Consequently, a final and conclusive judgment rendered by a United States court in an action brought
in accordance with applicable law to enforce the obligations of the Dutch Guarantor cannot be enforced
(ten uitvoer worden gelegd) in the Netherlands against the Dutch Guarantor, without having the dispute
be re-litigated before a competent court in the Netherlands. The Dutch courts will have the discretion
to attach such weight to the judgment rendered by the United States courts as they deem appropriate.
Based on case law, the Dutch courts may be expected to adjudicate substantial importance to a final,
conclusive and enforceable judgment as to monetary obligations rendered by a United States court of
competent jurisdiction without full re-examination or full re-litigation of the substantive matters
adjudicated upon (marginale toetsing), provided that: (a) the relevant United States court had
jurisdiction in the relevant subject matter based on internationally accepted standards, (b) the
proceedings before such United States court complied with proper procedure and fair trial (behoorlijke
_rechtspleging), (c) such judgment does not conflict with Dutch public policy (openbare orde), and (d)_
such judgment is not incompatible with (i) a judgment rendered by the Dutch courts in relation to a

##### 441


-----

dispute that involves the same parties as the judgment that parties are seeking to enforce against the
Dutch Guarantor in the Netherlands, or (ii) a judgment rendered by a foreign court in relation to a
dispute that involves the same parties as the judgment that parties are seeking to enforce in the
Netherlands against the Dutch Guarantor in the Netherlands, dealing with the same subject matter and
is based on the same cause, provided that such previous judgment is recognized in the Netherlands (voor
_erkenning in Nederland vatbaar). The same applies to a final and conclusive judgment rendered by an_
English court in an action brought in accordance with applicable law to enforce the obligations of the
Dutch Guarantor, unless such judgement is rendered in connection with an agreement and the relevant
English court has assumed jurisdiction on the basis of a symmetrical exclusive jurisdiction clause in
such agreement in which case such judgement will be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands
without re-litigation of the dispute in question subject to the provisions of the The Hague Choice of
Court Convention and the the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke
_Rechtsvordering)._

Notwithstanding a contractual provision to the contrary, a competent court in the Netherlands may
assume jurisdiction (i) pursuant to Section 254 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van
_Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering) in urgent matters, when, in view of the interests of the parties, provisional_
measures are required, (ii) in the context of an attachment against the Company or any of its assets, and
(iii) if the defendant enters appearance and does not contest the jurisdiction prior to defences relating to
the merits and, if Section 1 of Title 1 of Book 1 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek _van_
_Burgerlijke_ _Rechtsvordering) applies, there is a reasonable ground for jurisdiction of such Dutch court._
In addition, the validity and binding effect of any contractual jurisdiction clause may be limited by
Article 8 and Article 24 of the Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil
and commercial matters (recast) (the “Brussels I Regulation”).

Dutch law does not know the concept of a process agent for proceedings in the Netherlands. For the
purposes of proceedings in the Netherlands, the only effect a service of process clause might bring about
is a choice of domicile (domiciliekeuze) for the purpose of proceedings. To the extent such a choice of
domicile is validly done, due service of process would still require following the relevant procedures in
the applicable treaties and the Dutch code of civil procedure. Hence, a service of process clause would
not have the effect of establishing the possibility of serving court documents simply by sending them
to the chosen address without any further formalities to be taken into account. Under Dutch law, it is
questionable whether a contractual provision allowing the service of process against a party to a service
agent can be relied upon as valid serving of process against such party for the purpose of proceedings
in countries other than the Netherlands. There is no authoritative Dutch case law on the binding effect
of a foreign decision in the Netherlands in the case that service of process has been performed at the
address of a process agent and not at the address of the defendant. In such case there is a risk that, if the
defendant did not appear in court, a Dutch court will decide that no proper service of process has taken
place, and will not give binding effect to the foreign decision in the Netherlands

In addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in
an original action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws.

Under Dutch law a power of attorney (volmacht) or a mandate (lastgeving), which may include the
appointment of an agent for service of process: (a) can only be made irrevocable to the extent that its
object is the performance of legal acts (rechtshandelingen) in the interest of the representative appointed
thereby or a third party, and (b) will terminate by force of law, and without notice, irrespective of the
law governing the power of attorney, upon the bankruptcy of the grantor of the power of attorney, whilst
in the event of a suspension of payment (surseance _van_ _betaling), (provisionally) granted to the grantor_
of the power of attorney, the cooperation of the administrator (bewindvoerder) is required for the
(continued) exercise of rights and/or authority under the power of attorney.

##### 442


-----

Any enforcement of agreements governed by foreign law and any foreign judgments in the Netherlands
will be subject to the rules of Dutch civil procedure. Judgments may be rendered in a foreign currency
but enforcement is executed in EUR at the applicable rate of exchange. Enforcement of obligations in
the Netherlands will be subject to the nature of the remedies available in the courts of the Netherlands.
Under certain circumstances, a Dutch court has the power to stay proceedings (aanhouden) or to declare
that it has no jurisdiction, if concurrent proceedings are being brought elsewhere.

A Dutch court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only
to the extent that they are necessary to compensate actual losses and damages.

another economic standstill or, respectively on a successful continuation of business after the end of the
most significant negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the financial support from
shareholders or external third parties will be continued. As stated in the section “Group risk
management” of the notes to the 2019 Audited Consolidated Financial Statements, these events and
conditions as a going concern and that represents a risk that Group’s ability to continue as a going

 Selected notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements 

##### (1) General

APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, with its registered head office in Leinfelden-Echterdingen,
Germany, is a limited liability company under German law. As the parent company of the Group
(APCOA Parking Group), it is registered at the Stuttgart District Court under commercial register
sheet number 726108. The company’s administrative head office is located at Flughafenstrasse
34, 70629 Stuttgart, Germany. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements are
presented in euros (€), as the majority of Group transactions are processed in that currency.
Unless otherwise specified, the presentation is in thousands of euros (T€). The use of rounded
amounts and percentages may result in differences due to commercial rounding. The interim
condensed consolidated income statement is prepared in accordance with the nature of expense
format.

The Group operates in the parking facilities management area. The Group has a diversified
portfolio of rental/lease agreements and management agreements for the management of
parking spaces/facilities and parking garages.

The company is wholly owned by Park Luxco 3 S.C.A., with its registered head office in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg. Park Luxco S.C.A., with its registered head office in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg, is the ultimate parent company and indirect shareholder in APCOA Parking
Holdings GmbH.

##### (2) Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

 2.1 Basis of preparation
The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31,
2021 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting, in conformity
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the European Union
(EU) as of March 31, 2021. The term “IFRS” encompasses all standards published by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as the interpretations of the
International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).

The Group has prepared the financial statements on the basis that it will continue to operate as
a going concern, which assumes that the Group is able to meet the mandatory repayment terms
of the lease and loan liabilities as disclosed in note (17) Financial liabilities. The directors consider
that there are no material uncertainties that may cast doubt over this assumption. APCOA has
been severely affected by the emergence of coronavirus (SARS – CoV-2) in its markets, and by
the global measures taken in the form of travel restrictions, curfews, event cancellations and the
closure of public. APCOA has taken a variety of measures to mitigate the effects. The
Management Board formed a judgement that there is a reasonable expectation that the Group
has adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future, and not less than 12
months from the end of the reporting period.

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and
disclosures required in the annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with
the Group’s annual consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2020.

##### 2.1 New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Group
The Accounting policies adopted in the preparations of the interim condensed consolidated
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group’s annual
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, except for the adoption
of new standards effective as of January 1, 2021. The group has not early adopted any
standards, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but not yet effective.


-----

of March 31, 2021

Several amendments apply for the first time in 2021, but do not have impact on the interim
condensed financial statements of the Group.

##### (3) Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic

The Group has business activities have been significantly affected by the pandemic and the
associated uncertainties since March 2020. In particular, due to the still not fully foreseeable
global consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, the estimates and discretionary decisions made
in connection with the assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet are subject to a greater
level of uncertainty.

In updating the estimates and judgements, account was taken of information available
concerning expected economic trends and country-specific government policies.

This information was included particularly in impairment tests for the cash-generating units; in
the case of impairment of trade receivables, the expected credit loss model was reviewed in
relation to the assessment of future economic conditions in the context of Covid-19. Furthermore,
this information was taken into account in the tax planning prepared by the Norwegian subsidiary,
as sufficient taxable income exists in the long term against which the loss carry forwards can be
offset.

Aside from the ongoing effect of the Covid-19 pandemic there were no other significant
developments during the reporting period.

##### (4) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risks arise when financial obligations exceed financial assets at any point in time. The
Group manages liquidity risks by maintaining an adequate, readily available reserve for
ensuring the required level of liquidity at all times. The Group’s liquidity is monitored on an
ongoing basis. An additional T€ 33,997 can be drawn from the revolving credit facility as
required. A further line of the Guarantee Facility in an amount of T€ 10,859 can be utilised for
bank guarantees for rental obligations and letter of credits. In the 2020 financial year, the Group
had available lines of T€ 33,997 from the Revolving Credit Facility and T€ 10,569 from the
Guarantee Facility. For further details, please see note (17) Financial liabilities.

APCOA Parking Group’s liquidity risk has increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic arising in
2020 and its impact on revenue. The management has taken additional measures to ensure
sufficient liquidity within the Group. These include reductions in rental payments through
contract renegotiations, changes in fixed to variable rental components, operating expense and
overhead reductions, investment reductions, and the use of government measures such as
short-time working allowances.

Financing facility (Facility B2) of T€ 78,000 has the same seniority and maturity as the existing
bullet facility of T€ 514,000 (Term Loan Facility B). The interest rate on this facility is 7.25% p.a.,
while the interest rate on Term Loan B is currently 3.75% p.a.

##### (5)  Going concern

At the end of March 31, 2021, the Group’s debt financing was mainly provided by a syndicated
loan. These include bullet loans of T€ 592,000 (Facility B, Facility B2) with a term until March
2024, a guarantee facility of T€ 30,000 (Guarantee Facility) with a term until March 2023 and a
revolving credit facility of T€ 35.000 (Revolving Credit Facility) with a term until March 2023. As
of March 31, 2021, the guarantee line had been drawn in the amount of T€ 19,431, and the
revolving credit facility in the amount of T€ 1,003.

The liquidity ratios currently required under the syndicated loan were met by the Group.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that commenced in 2020, APCOA Parking Group has been
significantly impacted in economic terms. The Group has adapted its budget planning to reflect
expectations of how long Covid-19 will impact the business across the various market sectors.


-----

of March 31, 2021

On the basis of available data (e.g. in relation to the vaccination programs), the management
considers a renewed wave of infections of the magnitude as at the end of 2020 and first quarter
2021 from the third quarter 2021 onwards to be unlikely. In a worst-case scenario, management
still assumed a gradual easing of the lockdown measures in the summer months due to the
successive increase in vaccination rates throughout Europe, and an accompanying recovery in
the revenue trend. However, in this case, possible further lockdown measures in the wake of a
resurgence in Covid-19 infection numbers after the summer months of 2021 (beginning in the fall
of 2021) have been considered by the management for the period from October 2021 through to
March 2022. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, the management expects a greater level of
reductions in revenue to occur again in the worst-case scenario due to a possible further Covid19 infection wave, especially for the “Airport” and “Trade Fairs and Events” segments. In the
Management Board’s opinion, the refinancing measures described under (23) Events after the
balance sheet date is sufficient to secure the company as a going concern and are also sufficient
to safeguard against further negative developments from the Covid-19 pandemic. Solvency and
compliance with new credit terms and a positive going concern outlook, are secured according
to the management’s expectation. For this reason, the financial statements have been prepared
under the going concern assumption. However, the further course of the pandemic cannot be
assessed definitively.

of March 31, 2021

##### (20) Consolidated statement of cash flows

The cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents of the Group resultant
from cash inflows and cash outflows during the reporting period. In accordance with IAS 7
“Statements of Cash Flows”, the presentation of the cash flow statement is differentiated
according to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. The effects of currency
fluctuation on cash and cash equivalents that are held in foreign currencies or are due in foreign
currencies are presented separately from the cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities.

The funds in the cash flow statement comprise exclusively the cash and cash equivalents as
reported on the balance sheet (see note 16). This includes bank credit balances in the amount
of T€ 2,319 (December 31, 2020: T€ 1,976), which the Group may only use for specific purposes
owing to statutory provisions or contractual obligations.

##### (21) Contingent liabilities

APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A. received a tax assessment notice from the City of Avellino regarding
charges and fees for occupying public land (TOSAP) for a total amount of € 11.5 million for the
2013 to 2017 period (including interest and penalty surcharges). These assessments from 2013
until April 2015 were successfully contested at the first and second instance. The municipality
lodged a related appeal. The appeal against the notices from May 2015 was rejected at second
instance. The company has appealed this decision.

The management currently assumes that the risk of utilization is unlikely. Moreover, the
possibility exists that the resultant risk can be transferred to the garage’s owner. For this reason,
the provision has not been formed in this set of interim condensed consolidated financial
statements as of March 31, 2021.

##### (22) Group risk management 

**Financial risk management**

The Group is exposed to various financial risks that arise from the operating business activity
and the financial activities of the Group. The most important financial risks for the Group derive
from changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit standing and solvency of counterparties of
the Group. The periodic reporting of risks is performed by the corresponding controlling functions
within the Group. A stringent and stable financing structure is stipulated for the Group aimed at
compliance with the agreements for external financing concluded within the framework of the
syndicated credit agreement (covenants). Compliance with the covenants is monitored on a
regular basis.

Derivative financial instruments may only be used for hedging purposes. Depending on the risk
assessment, selective derivative financial instruments and non-derivative hedging instruments
are deployed. Hedging transactions for hedging of the default risk are generally concluded only
with leading financial institutions.

##### (23) Events after the balance sheet date

Also in early 2021, APCOA continues to be heavily affected by governmental containment
measures with respect to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in areas such as airports, trade
shows and events. The further course of such containment measures and the consequences
for the Group’s business performance are being monitored on an ongoing basis. Based on
recent developments (continuation of mobility restrictions in the first quarter of 2021), the
Management Board expects that the spread of coronavirus and the necessary containment
measures and associated reductions in frequencies will have a significant negative impact on
the Group’s business compared to the pre-coronavirus period and on its financial position and
performance in the remainder of 2021.

On July 1, 2021, the APCOA Parking Group obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks
comprising (i) a EUR 665 million senior secured fixed and floating rate bridge facility (the
“Bridge Facility”) and (ii) a EUR 80 million super senior revolving credit facility (which may be
utilised by way of cash loans, letters of credit, bank guarantees and ancillary facilities) (the
“ssRCF”). The obligations under the ssRCF and Bridge Facility will be guaranteed by the
material subsidiaries of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH and will be secured by pledges over
certain shares, material bank accounts and structural intercompany receivables. The ssRCF
contains customary financial covenants, which will be tested in accordance with, and at the
times specified in, the provisions of the agreement governing the ssRCF. Both the ssRCF and
Bridge Facility contain customary negative, incurrence covenants. The Bridge Facility will have
a tenor of 5.5 years. The ssRCF will have a tenor of 5 years. The proceeds from the Bridge
Facility will be used to refinance all of the outstanding indebtedness of the APCOA Parking
Group under the existing senior credit facilities agreement, to fund cash to the group’s balance
sheet for general corporate and working capital purposes and to pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the refinancing transaction. It is currently the intention of the
APCOA Parking Group to place one or more tranches of senior secured notes (the “Notes”)
with institutional investors in lieu of making drawings under the Bridge Facility. The issuance
of Notes will depend on market conditions and other factors.

As of the date of issuance of this report APCOA Parking Group companies applied for € 13.2
million of government grants, which were not yet approved.

No further events of particular significance occurred after the end of the financial year under
review.

The interim consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2021 were approved by the
Management Board on July 5, 2021.

The following auditor‘s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has been
issued in accordance with Section 322 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the
consolidated financial statements and group management report (Konzernlagebericht) of APCOA
Parking Holdings GmbH as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The group
management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, Leinfelden-Echterdingen

##### Audit Opinions

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH,

Leinfelden-Echterdingen, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated

statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, and the consolidated statement of

comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of

changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to

31 December 2020, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of

significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of

APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law
pursuant to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial
Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets,
liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2020, and of its financial
performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2020, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any

reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the

group management report.

##### Basis for the Audit Opinions

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management

report in accordance with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards

for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of

Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles

are further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial

Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are

F 20


-----

independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and

professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in

accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial

statements and on the group management report.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
##### Group Management Report

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements
that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional

requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated

financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets,

liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive

directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the

preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for

assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for

disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for

financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to

liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management

report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material

respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal

requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In

addition, the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as

they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in

accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient

appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group_
##### Management Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial

statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and

whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s

position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and

the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and

appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an

auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on

F 21


-----

the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in

accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for

Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always

detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the

economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this

group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We

also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of
these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to
modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained
up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the
Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit
opinions.

F 22


-----

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors
in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we
evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for
the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information
from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective
information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk
that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the

planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant

deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

**Management co-investment program**

As the parent company of APCOA PARKING Group, Park Luxco 3 S.C.A., a company under
Luxembourg law that holds 100% of the shares in APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, persons
of APCOA PARKING Group together with further external individuals (together referred to as
the co-investors) hold an indirect 12.50% interest via a co-investment company, Park
Investment S.C.S.p. As of the balance sheet date, this group of individuals held 89.9% of the
shares available for this purpose. The shares were offered to the co-investors in 2016 and
2017 at the respective current fair values. The fair value was calculated by an external valuer
based on recognised valuation methods, including applying peer group earnings multiples. The
co-investment program plans for the co-investors to participate in a change of ownership of
the parent company, including due to a disposal or an IPO, in the resultant net proceeds in
accordance with their indirect interests. The co-investment program includes regulations for
the instance that the group of individuals leave the company early. Depending on the reason
and timing of the departure from the company, co-investors in this instance are entitled to the
repurchase of their investment at a value between the original purchase cost and the fair value
on the date of leaving the company, if a minimum employment period of three years has been
reached. Repurchase in this context is structured in the form of mutual call and put options,
depending on the reason and timing of the departure from the company.
As the shares were acquired by the co-investors at the respective current fair values on the
purchase date, no emolument to be recognised as personnel expenses in the period existed
or exists.

**(3)** **Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the European Union (EU) as of 31
December 2020, and with the supplementary provisions under Section 315e of the German
Commercial Code (HGB). The term “IFRS” encompasses all standards published by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as the interpretations of the
International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
assumes that the Group is able to meet the mandatory repayment terms of the lease and loan
liabilities as disclosed in note (34) Financial liabilities. APCOA has been severely affected by
the emergence of coronavirus (SARS – CoV-2) in its markets, and by the global measures
taken in the form of travel restrictions, curfews, event cancellations and the closure of public
facilities (see also the comments in the Group management report). APCOA has taken a
variety of measures to mitigate the effects (see note (43) Group risk management).
Consequently, the Management Board expects that the Group will have adequate resources
to continue operations for the foreseeable future.

Reporting for financial year 2020 is based on the applicable mandatory standards and provides
a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance. The Group has not made
early, voluntary application of standards and IFRIC interpretations that have already been
issued but had not yet entered into force. The company will apply these standards and
interpretations for the first time as of the mandatory date.

**New or amended standards and interpretations adopted by the EU and applicable for**
**the first time during the financial year under review**

The amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations clarifies that an integrated group of
activities and assets must include at least one input of resources and one substantive process
that, taken together, contribute significantly to the production of goods or services in order to
qualify as a business. It is also clarified that a combination may constitute a business even if it
does not include all the resource inputs and processes necessary to generate the output. This
clarification has no effect on the first-time consolidations that took place in the financial year
under review. The first-time application of these amendments did not have any effect on the
financial position and performance.

On 28 May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16: Covid-19-Related Rent
Concessions. The amendments provide lessees with relief in applying the rules in IFRS 16 on
accounting for lease modifications due to rent concessions as a consequence of the
coronavirus pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect to suspend the evaluation
of whether a lessor’s pandemic rent concession constitutes an amendment to the lease. A
lessee that makes this election accounts for any qualifying lease modification resulting from
the coronavirus pandemic rent concession in the same way as it would account for the
modification under IFRS 16 if it were not a lease modification. The amendments are to be
applied for financial years commencing on or after 1 June 2020. However, early application is
permitted, which APCOA has exercised for all qualifying leases. The amendments were
applied to all Covid-19 rent concessions within the scope of the amendment, including those
prior to 1 June 2020. The application of the amendment to IFRS 16 has a minor impact on the
financial position and performance. Income from negative variable rental payments is shown
in note (12).

The amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 provide a new definition of “material”, stating that
information is material “if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to
influence the decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make
on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific
reporting entity”. The amendments specify that materiality depends on the nature or extent of
the information, either in isolation or in combination with other information, against the


-----

as of 31 December 2020

background of the financial statements as a whole. Incorrect information is material if, under
normal circumstances, it is likely to influence the decisions taken by the principal addressees.
These amendments had no effect on the consolidated financial statements and are not
expected to have any effect on the Group in the future.

In September 2019, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 in relation
to the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement provide for various facilitation rules that apply to
all hedging relationships directly affected by the reform of the benchmark rates. Such hedging
relationships can be identified by the fact that the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the
timing and/or amount of the benchmark rate-based cash flows from the hedged item or hedging
instrument. As no cases of application exist at present within APCOA PARKING Group, the
first-time application of these amendments did not have any effect on the financial position and
performance.

The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting issued on 29 March 2018 is not a standard,
and none of the concepts it contains take precedence over the concepts or requirements
contained in the standards. In particular, the Conceptual Framework is intended to assist the
IASB in developing standards, preparers of financial statements in developing consistent
accounting policies when the accounting treatment of a transaction is not governed by a
standard, and all parties in understanding and interpreting standards. This will affect those
entities that have developed their accounting policies on the basis of the Conceptual
Framework. The revised Conceptual Framework includes some new concepts, updated
definitions and recognition criteria for assets and liabilities, and clarifications of some important
concepts. These changes had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.

**New or amended standards and interpretations either not yet adopted by the EU or not**
**yet applied**

In January 2020, the IASB published amendments to IAS 1 on the classification of liabilities as
current or non-current. In particular, the amendments to IAS 1 clarify that the classification of
liabilities as current or non-current is to be based on the entity’s rights existing as of the balance
sheet date. In this context, the management’s expectations and intentions as to whether such
a right will actually be exercised or early repayment is intended should not be taken into
consideration. The amendments to IAS 1 are to be applied retrospectively and for financial
years commencing on or after 1 January 2023. At present, APCOA PARKING Group does not
expect the first-time application of the amendments to IAS 1 to have any effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

In May 2020, the IASB published amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment:
Proceeds before Intended Use. Accordingly, entities will no longer be permitted to deduct from
the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment proceeds from the sale of goods produced
while an item of property, plant and equipment is being brought to the location and condition
necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by the management.
Instead, such revenue is to be recognised in the income statement together with the cost of
the item of property, plant and equipment. The amendments are effective for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2022, and are to be applied retrospectively to property,
plant and equipment brought into working condition on or after the start of the earliest annual
period presented in the financial statements in which the amendments are first applied. At
present, APCOA PARKING Group does not expect the first-time application of the
amendments to have any effect on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and
Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract, in order to specify which
costs a company should consider when assessing whether a contract is onerous or lossmaking. The amendment focuses on costs that are directly related to the contract (directly
related cost approach). Costs associated with the performance of contracts for the supply of
goods or services include both the directly attributable (incremental) costs of fulfilling the


-----

as of 31 December 2020

contract, and overheads that relate directly to activities undertaken in fulfilling the contract.
General administrative costs are not directly related to the contract and are consequently not
included in the contract performance costs, unless the contract expressly provides for them to
be passed on to the customer. The amendments are to be applied for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2022. At present, APCOA PARKING Group does not expect
the first-time application of the amendments to have any effect on the consolidated financial
statements.

In August 2020, the IASB adopted amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS
16 in relation to the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (IBOR Reform) – Phase 2. The
amendments provide temporary relief when a reference interest rate (IBOR – Inter-bank
Offered Rate) is replaced by an alternative near risk-free rate (RFR), and this has a bearing on
financial reporting. The reliefs provide that contractual changes or changes in cash flows
directly required by the reform are treated as changes in a floating rate, which is equivalent to
a movement in the market rate. The amendments are to be applied for financial years
commencing on or after 1 January 2021 and are to be applied retrospectively. Early application
is permitted. APCOA PARKING Group is currently assessing the effect of the amendments on
the consolidated financial statements.

In addition to the amendments described in detail above, the IASB has issued further
pronouncements, the application of which is also not yet mandatory at the present time and
whose applicability in some cases still requires adoption into EU law. APCOA PARKING Group
does not currently expect the application of these pronouncements to have a material effect
on its financial position and performance.

In the event of recognition by the EU of IASB pronouncements that are not mandatory until
later financial years, APCOA PARKING Group does not currently plan any early adoption,
except for the expressly stated early adoption of IASB amendments to IFRS 16: Covid-19Related Rent Concessions.

**Investments in equity accounted companies**

Investments in equity accounted companies comprise associated companies and joint
ventures. As a matter of principle, companies over which the company exerts a significant
influence or which are joint ventures are equity accounted in the company’s consolidated
financial statements. On 4 January 2019, the company and a partner established the joint
venture ParcBrux BVBA, located in Ghent, Belgium, with a registered capital of T€ 200, of
which 50% (T€ 100) is attributable to APCOA.

On 4 October 2017, the company acquired a 13.33% interest in AGILE PARKING SOLUTIONS
PRIVATE LIMITED, New Delhi, India. The company has the right to a seat on the Supervisory
Board of this company and thereby exercises significant influence over this associated


-----

as of 31 December 2020

company. With a balance sheet date of 31 March, the company’s balance sheet date differs
from the Group’s balance sheet date.

**(5)** **Other holdings**

Other investments in which the company holds less than 20% are carried at fair value with no
effect on income.

**(6)** **Acquisitions**

In 2020, APCOA made the following strategic acquisitions as part of the Group strategy:

a) XPERT Parkering Sweden AB

With effect as of 2 January 2020, APCOA PARKING Sverige AB acquired 100% of the shares
in XPERT Parkering Sweden AB in order to strengthen its presence in Sweden and to drive
growth. Xpert operates parking management with around 40,000 managed parking spaces in
Sweden. The company was fully consolidated in APCOA PARKING Group on the acquisition
date.

Since its initial consolidation on 2 January 2020, Xpert has contributed T€ 6,117 to
consolidated revenue and T€ 1,238 to consolidated net profit.

The transaction costs for the acquisition of Xpert, which were recognised in other expenses for
the 2020 financial year, amounted to T€ 275.

The transaction is classified as an acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. The purchase price
amounted to T€ 5,776 in cash, as well as a contingent purchase price payment depending on
the future business development of Xpert, with a fair value of T€ 1,455. The maximum amount
from the contingent purchase price is T€ 2,393. The goodwill arising from the acquisition
amounting to T€ 6,851 consists mainly of components that cannot be separately identified,
such as positive business prospects, synergies with existing operations and employee
expertise.

In total, trade receivables from third parties with a gross value of T€ 99, which corresponds to
the fair value and the expected fully recoverable receivables, were acquired.

b) Security Park Group

With effect from 1 December 2020, APCOA Parking Norway AS has directly and indirectly
acquired all shares in Security Park AS, Profectum AS and Automaten AS. The Security Park
Group manages and markets parking facilities in Norway using technological solutions. The


-----

as of 31 December 2020

aim is to strengthen the presence in Norway and to accelerate growth. The companies were
fully consolidated in APCOA PARKING Group on the acquisition date.

Since its initial consolidation on 1 December 2020, the Security Park Group has contributed
T€ 546 to consolidated revenue and T€ 124 to consolidated net profit. If the acquisition had
taken place on 1 January 2020, it would have contributed T€ 6,769 to revenue and a profit of
T€ 601 to consolidated net profit.

The transaction costs for the acquisition of the Security Park Group, which were recognised in
other expenses for the 2020 financial year, amounted to T€ 391.

The transaction is classified as an acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. The acquisition price
amounted to T€ 7,061 in both cash and contingent consideration. The contingent consideration
depends on the future performance of the business; the fair value amounts to T€ 1,140, which
corresponds to the maximum amount of the contingent purchase price obligation.

The goodwill arising from the acquisition amounted to T€ 7,298 and consists mainly of
components that cannot be separately identified, such as positive business prospects,
synergies with existing operations in Norway, and employee expertise.

In total, trade receivables from third parties with a gross value of T€ 346, which corresponds
to the fair value and the expected fully recoverable receivables of T€ 326, were acquired.

As the acquisition occurred shortly before the balance sheet date, assets and liabilities were
measured provisionally in accordance with IFRS 3.45; the finalisation of the measurement has
not yet been completed. If this results in new information about facts and circumstances that
existed at the time of the respective acquisition, the acquisition accounting will be adjusted
accordingly.

### 2. Accounting and measurement methods

**(7)** **Consolidation principles**

The consolidated financial statements include APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH and the
subsidiaries over which it exercises direct or indirect control. APCOA PARKING Group controls
an investee if it has power over the investee. In other words, APCOA PARKING Group has
existing rights giving it the current ability to direct the relevant activities. These are activities
that significantly influence returns from the investee. APCOA PARKING Group must also have
exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the ability to
use its power over the investee to affect the level of such returns.

Where APCOA PARKING Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other facts and
circumstances may mean that APCOA PARKING Group controls an investee (including
contractual arrangements which give APCOA PARKING Group power over the investee).
APCOA PARKING Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and
circumstances indicate that changes have occurred to the factors determining control.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when APCOA PARKING Group acquires control
and deconsolidated from the date when APCOA PARKING Group forgoes control. All assets,
liabilities, income, expenditure and cash flows of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH are
combined with those of its subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.

Intragroup transactions (revenues, expenses and income as well as receivables and liabilities)
are fully eliminated.

Any difference that arises from the acquisition of further shares or the sale of shares after the
initial consolidation without any loss of control over an already fully consolidated subsidiary is
taken directly to equity.

**Corporate acquisitions**

A business combination is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial
Statements” applying the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations”. The acquired assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value at the time
of acquisition. This entails offsetting the costs to acquire the participating interests with the fair
values of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Any excess over the
acquisition cost is recognised as goodwill and impairment tested at least once a year. Where
the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the
difference is immediately recognised in profit or loss. If less than 100% of shares are acquired,
the acquisition costs of an investment are compared against the fair values of the assets and
liabilities acquired on a pro rata basis. Minority interests are reported in equity in the amount
of the residual fair value, including the profits and losses attributable to them.

Applying the acquisition method requires estimates and assessments to be made, in particular
in determining the fair value of the intangible assets and of the property, plant and equipment
acquired, and the liabilities assumed, upon acquisition, as well as the useful lives of the
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired. The estimates made as part of
allocating the purchase price may significantly influence the Group’s future results.

**(8)** **Currency translation**

Business transactions recorded in the individual financial statements of entities that process
their business transactions in currencies other than the respective local currencies are
translated at the exchange rate applicable as of the transaction date. Monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies (liquid assets, receivables, liabilities) are translated at the
closing rate applicable at the respective balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are recorded at fair value are translated at the


-----

as of 31 December 2020

exchange rates valid as of the date when the fair value is determined. Gains and losses arising
from currency translation are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group includes 23 (previous year: 19) subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
euro. With the exception of one company (APCOA Parking Holdings UK Ltd., Uxbridge), the
subsidiaries’ functional currency corresponds to the respective local currency, as the
subsidiaries are economically independent foreign sub-entities. For the purposes of the
consolidated financial statements, financial statements prepared in foreign currencies are
translated into euros. The financial statements are translated on the basis of the functional
currency concept in accordance with IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates” applying the modified closing rate method. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities are
translated at the closing rate, equity at the historical rate, and expenses and income at the
average exchange rate for the year. Any differences arising from currency translation are
posted to the Group’s other reserves (reserve for currency differences). When a subsidiary is
disposed of, these translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

Currency translation in the Group is based on the following exchange rates against the euro:

**Closing rate** **Average rate** **Closing rate** **Average rate**
**Currency** **ISO Code** **2020** **2020** **2019** **2019**
British pound GBP 0.899030 0.889214 0.850800 0.877307

Swiss franc CHF 1.080200 1.070309 1.085400 1.112672

**(9)** **Use of management estimates and judgements**

As part of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Management Board must make
estimates and assumptions that can impact on components and items in the consolidated
financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual
developments may vary from the estimates and assumptions made.

**Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic**

Our business activities have been significantly affected by the pandemic and the associated
uncertainties since March 2020. In particular, due to the still not fully foreseeable global
consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, the estimates and discretionary decisions made in
connection with the assets and liabilities reported in the balance sheet are subject to a greater
level of uncertainty.

In updating the estimates and judgements, account was taken of information available
concerning expected economic trends and country-specific government policies.

This information was included particularly in impairment tests for the cash-generating units; in
the case of impairment of trade receivables, the expected credit loss model was reviewed in
relation to the assessment of future economic conditions in the context of Covid-19.
Furthermore, this information was taken into account in the tax planning prepared by the
Norwegian subsidiary, as sufficient taxable income exists in the long term against which the
loss carry forwards can be offset.

**Trade receivables**

All trade receivables are initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted
for impairment to reflect the expected default. The calculation is based on historical default
rates, which are adjusted to reflect current economic developments. As a rule, a decline in the
volume of receivables reduces such value adjustments on a portfolio basis accordingly, and


-----

as of 31 December 2020

vice versa. If individual receivables are at risk of default, estimates and assessments based
on the respective customer’s creditworthiness are included.

**Impairment**

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit, an asset and an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is based on management estimates. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. The
company normally determines these values in line with valuation methods based on discounted
cash flows. These discounted cash flows are calculated on the basis of five-year forecasts
which are prepared in line with financial plans authorised by the Management Board. The cash
flow forecasts take into consideration historical data and are based on the Management
Board’s best estimates of future development. Cash flows beyond the planning period are
extrapolated applying a standard growth rate that is determined in consideration of the
expected long-term development potential of the relevant markets and publicly available longterm inflation expectations as well as the possibility of passing these on to customers in the
form of price increases. Weighted average costs of capital are utilised to discount the cash
flows. These are based on a peer group and were determined using capital market data. The
most important assumptions on which the determination of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use is based include estimated cash flows, estimated growth rates, weighted average
costs of capital, and tax rates. The measurement of intangible assets with indeterminable
useful lives is additionally dependent on the underlying licence rates. These premises and their
underlying methodology can have a significant impact on the respective values and ultimately
on the amount of possible impairment of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives,
and other assets. Further details on estimates and assumptions are provided in note (10)
Accounting and measurement methods, under the heading “Impairment of long-lived assets”
and note (21) Intangible assets.

**Pensions and similar obligations**

Obligations for pensions and similar commitments and related expenses and income are
calculated in accordance with actuarial valuations. Such valuations are based on key
assumptions, including discounting factors, wage and pension trends, and life expectancies.
The discount factor applied reflects the interest rates that can be achieved as of the balance
sheet date for high-value fixed-interest investments with matching maturities. The underlying
assumptions can differ from actual outcomes due to a fluctuating market and economic
situation. This can exert significant effects on the obligations of pensions and other postretirement benefits. The resultant differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive
income under equity in the period in which they arise, and do not affect profit and loss as a
consequence.

**Other provisions**

The calculation of provisions is associated with significant estimates. Other provisions are
formed for a large number of individual risks whose payment dates or amounts are uncertain.
Determining these other provisions requires the making of estimates. These provisions also
relate to provisions against risks arising from legal disputes and processes, insofar as these
fulfil the criteria for making provisions. Assessing the level of such provisions entails not only
an assessment of circumstances in the specific case that is being asserted, but also making
recourse to the results of comparable proceedings and appraisals by lawyers and other factors,
as well as assumptions about event probabilities and the bandwidths of potential utilisation.

**Income tax**

The recognition of tax provisions is based on estimates. It should also be determined whether
the recognition of deferred tax assets is permitted, or whether a valuation adjustment to
deferred tax assets is required. The likelihood that deferred tax assets arising from timing
differences and losses carried forward can be offset against taxable profits in the future must


-----

as of 31 December 2020

be evaluated. Deferred tax assets must also be recognised to the extent that sufficient taxable
temporary differences are available. Uncertainties exist concerning the interpretation of
complex tax regulations as well as concerning the amount and date of future taxable income.

**Leasing**

The measurement of liabilities from leases and rights of use assets requires assumptions to
be made regarding key parameters or their probabilities and dates of occurrence or exercise,
as well as the determination of an appropriate capitalisation rate. In determining the term of
leases, all facts and circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise renewal
options or not to exercise termination options are taken into consideration. Term changes
arising from the exercise of renewal or termination options are only included in the contract
term if their exercise is reasonably certain. For APCOA PARKING Group this is regularly the
case if the exercise option lies within the detailed planning period and is reflected in planning.

For further information, please refer to note (10) Accounting and valuation methods, and (41)
Information about leases.

**Adjustment according to IAS 8**

On 1 January 2019, the company applied IFRS 16 Leases for the first time. In this context,
rental payments for airports in Norway were classified as quasi-fixed under IFRS 16.B42(a)(ii).
During 2020, APCOA determined that this classification is inaccurate as the payments are
variable payments that are not included in the lease payments for purposes of calculating the
lease liability and, subsequently, the right-of-use asset. Rather, variable lease payments that
are not included in the measurement of the lease liability are recognised by the lessee in profit
or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers these payments occurs (IFRS
16.38). As a consequence, the calculated deferred taxes also change.

Accordingly, the balance sheet as of 31 December 2019 overstates items of assets as well as
liabilities. The change in revenue reserves is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, while the change in other reserves relates to currency
translation effects in other comprehensive income. The following reconciliation summarises
the effects on the consolidated balance sheet:

In the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, depreciation for rights of use assets
and the interest expense for lease liabilities are reduced. Irrespective of the correction
described above, a change in disclosure was made. Previously, lease expenses as well as


-----

expenses for materials and purchased services for office rent and incidental expenses were
reported under other expenses. From 2020 onwards, expenses are reported directly in the
corresponding items, and the previous year are adjusted accordingly. In summary, the changes

**(10) Accounting and measurement principles**

The significant accounting and measurement principles applied in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are presented below. Further explanations of individual
consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet items, as well as the
corresponding figures, are provided in the notes.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets with a specified useful life are measured at acquisition cost and amortised
straight-line over their useful life, as a matter of principle. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are also reviewed for
impairment whenever indications exist of impairment and are written down to their recoverable
amount where necessary. If the factors causing a previously recognised impairment no longer
apply, the asset is reinstated at the value it would have had if no impairment had been
recognised in prior periods.

Useful lives and amortisation methods for intangible assets are reviewed at every reporting
date at the least. Where expectations are no longer in line with previous estimates, the


-----

as of 31 December 2020

corresponding changes are recognised as changes in accounting estimates in accordance with
IAS 8.

In addition to goodwill, the balance sheet item intangible assets also includes licenses, rights
of use assets, contractual rights and purchased software as well as intangible assets identified
in business combinations, contractual relationships (management contracts), internally
generated intangible assets and trademarks. The company applies the following amortisation
methods and useful lives:


**Amortization**


**Intangible assets** **method** **Useful life**

Goodwill - indefinite
Trademarks - indefinite
Acquired concessions, industrial property rights and similar rights and assets straight line 2 - 20 years
Contractual relations straight line 15 - 28 years
Internally developed intangible assets straight line 3 - 5 years

In the 2020 financial year, the contractual relationships were amortised over a remaining useful
life of 15 years for the contractual relationships already existing in the previous year, and over
15 – 20 years for the contractual relationships acquired in the 2020 and 2019 financial years.

**Service concession arrangements**

IFRIC 12 draws a distinction between two types of service concession arrangements. In the
first type, the operator records a financial asset, specifically an unconditional contractual right
to cash receipts or other financial assets from the government in return for constructing or
upgrading public sector assets. In the other type, the operator recognises an intangible asset
– a right to charge for use of a public sector asset that the operator has constructed or
upgraded. A right to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the
amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service. In the event that a
contract relates to both types of arrangements, IFRIC 12 provides for recognising a financial
asset to the extent that the government has given an unconditional guarantee of payment for
constructing a public sector asset. If the operator is dependent on the public using the service
in order to obtain payment, the operator records a corresponding intangible asset. The firsttime application of this interpretation in the 2008 financial year had the effect that an intangible
asset was capitalised in connection with the conclusion of an association agreement for the
operation of parking facilities. The acquisition costs, which amounted to T€ 4,416 as of 31
December 2020, will be written off over the contract period up to 2028. The carrying amount
as of 31 December 2020 stands at T€ 1,942. The object of the association agreement is the
building renovation of the parking area on the premises of Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg
Medical Clinic), on the one hand, and the related parking facilities management over a term of
20 years, on the other. To enable management of the parking area, parking processing
equipment must be financed by the holder of the concession licence (APCOA PARKING
Group), in return for the right to manage the parking facilities by charging parking fees to third
parties. APCOA PARKING Group bears the operator risk. For this reason, the service
concession arrangement is recognised in accordance with the intangible asset model.

At the end of the building concession arrangement the construction services performed by the
licence holder are transferred to the ownership of Klinikum Augsburg, either without
compensation, or at fair value, at the option of Klinikum Augsburg.

In the past financial year, revenues in the amount of T€ 1,292 (previous year: T€ 1,790) were
generated in this connection, and earnings of T€ 190 (previous year: T€ 486).

**Goodwill**

The goodwill arising from business combinations represents the surplus of acquisition costs of
the respective corporate acquisition over the Group’s share in the fair value of identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the acquisition date. This goodwill is allocated


-----

as of 31 December 2020

to the respective groups of cash-generating units and tested for impairment at least once a
year.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
The period over which property, plant and equipment is depreciated is based on the expected
useful economic life. In the year of acquisition, property, plant and equipment is depreciated
on a pro rata temporis. Residual carrying amounts, useful lives and depreciation methods are
reviewed at least once a year, on the reporting date. Where expectations are no longer in line
with previous estimates, the corresponding changes are accounted for as changes in
accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8. Rights of use from leases are also reported
under property, plant and equipment, as they are recorded under the same balance sheet
items as owned assets.

Asset disposals are recognised at historical cost, as well as under accumulated depreciation.
Gains or losses arising on disposals of property, plant and equipment are presented in other
operating income or other operating expenses.

The Group reviews property, plant and equipment for indications of impairment on a regular
basis, and at least as of every balance sheet date. APCOA PARKING Group applies the
following depreciation and amortisation methods, and useful lives:


**Depreciation**


**Property, plant and equipment** **method** **Useful life**

Land, land rights, buildings and buildings on third party land straight line 10 - 50 years
Technical equipment and machines straight line 3 - 15 years
Other equipment, operating and office equipment straight line 2 - 20 years

**Research and development**

Research and development expenditure is expensed in the period it is incurred, unless it has
to be capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”.

**Equity investments**

All purchases and sales of equity investments are recognised on the trade date.

**Impairment of long-lived assets**

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least
once per year. Impairment tests are performed for intangible assets with limited useful lives,
for rights of use, as well as for property, plant and equipment only if specific indications are
present pursuant to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. If the asset’s recoverable amount is less
than its carrying value, the impairment adjustment is recognised through profit and loss. The
recoverable amount is normally determined individually for each asset. If this is not possible, it
is determined based on a group of assets that largely generate independent cash flows. For
the Group, a cash-generating unit is generally a multi-storey car park. The recoverable amount
is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Purchased goodwill is
recognised as an asset and impairment tested at least once annually, as well as when
indications of impairment exist. This requires an estimate of the recoverable amount of the
groups of cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Pursuant to IAS 36, the
starting point to determine the cash-generating units is the company’s internal management
and reporting structure. As the internal reporting structure of APCOA PARKING Group is
country-based, the corresponding assets and goodwill were allocated to the respective
countries as cash-generating units.

In order to determine the recoverable value, both the value in use and the fair value of the
cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are determined. The leading value concept


-----

as of 31 December 2020

to determine recoverable value is the concept of fair value less costs to sell (net realisable
value).

The Group is required to apply an appropriate measurement model to determine net realisable
value. This method is based on the discounted cash flow valuation method as an indicator of
fair value.

The valuation method is to be allocated in its entirety to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy of
IFRS 13, as the valuation of the cash-generating units also includes non-observable input
factors.

**Annual impairment test of goodwill and brand marks as of 31 December 2020**

The periodic impairment test for APCOA PARKING Group’s goodwill and brand marks was
performed on 31 December 2020 (previous year: 31 December 2019). Updated financial plans
approved by management form the starting point. The plans have been adjusted to reflect the
impact of IFRS 16. The risk-adjusted capitalisation rates changed (after taxes) to rates ranging
between 5.09% and 6.52% (previous year: 5.11% and 7.42%). The pre-tax interest rate was
between 6.04% and 8.49% (in the previous year between 5.14% and 7.63%). The planning for
the budget and the mid-term plan (detailed planning period) was carried out on the basis of
detailed revenue and cost planning over 5 years (previous year: 4 years) at country and Group
level. To this end, assumptions were made primarily about the future trends in parking fees
and occupancy rates, as well as cost trends and new business. The trends in these
assumptions are based on internal Group estimates and external market studies. Influences
from the coronavirus pandemic were considered in the preparation of the 2021 budget and
subsequent mid-term plan. Based on past data, the management still assumes that the longterm growth rates can be achieved following the detailed planning period. A uniform growth
rate of 1.00% was applied for the long-term planning (previous year: 1.00%).


**Capitalisation**


**Capitalisation**


**Cash generaing unit** **rate** **rate** **Growth rate** **Growth rate**

**2020** **2019** **2020** **2019**
Germany 5.09% 5.45% 1.00% 1.00%
United Kingdom 6.10% 7.05% 1.00% 1.00%
Norway 6.52% - 1.00% Italy 6.48% 7.42% 1.00% 1.00%
Belgium 5.54% 5.93% 1.00% 1.00%
Denmark 5.22% 5.33% 1.00% 1.00%
Sweden 5.75% 6.04% 1.00% 1.00%
Austria 5.39% 5.69% 1.00% 1.00%
Netherlands 5.20% 5.65% 1.00% 1.00%
Switzerland 5.12% 5.11% 1.00% 1.00%
Ireland 5.42% 5.94% 1.00% 1.00%

Based on the impairment test conducted as of 31 December 2020, no impairment losses were
applied to the cash-generating units. It was also the case that in the previous year no
impairment losses were recognised.

The licence price analogy method was applied to calculate the fair value less costs to sell of
the “APCOA” and “EuroPark” brand marks. To this end, the Group has to select the brandrelevant future cash flows and also an appropriate discount rate to calculate these cash flows’
present value. The cash flows are derived from the corporate planning, with the latest
developments and trends being taken into consideration. They are discounted to the balance
sheet date applying a risk-equivalent capitalisation rate of 5.09% and 6.52% (previous year:
5.45% and 7.21%). The pre-tax interest rate lay between 6.77% and 8.01% (previous year:
5.53% and 7.35%). The detailed planning period was set at 5 years (previous year: 4 years).
The extrapolation of cash flows beyond the medium-term planning period was based on a
constant growth rate of 1.00% (previous year: 1.00%) in consideration of expected price and


-----

as of 31 December 2020

volume-based growth. The determination of the brand marks’ fair value less costs to sell was
based on licence rates in the 0.20% – 0.50% range (previous year: 0.20% – 0.50%). The
licence rates are selected on the basis of market analyses and management estimates. In the
event that the reason for impairment losses recognised in previous years is no longer valid,
such impairment losses can be reversed to reach a maximum of the original purchase cost.
No need for impairment losses was identified for the brand marks. For this reason, the
company has refrained from calculating a value in use.

**Inventories**

Raw materials, supplies and purchased merchandise are recognised at cost (measured
applying the weighted average cost method) or, to the extent required, at net realisable value,
whichever is lower. Inventory risks due to limited saleability and excess inventories are
adequately taken into consideration through valuation write-downs.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised at nominal value. Risk provisions are formed taking collateral
into consideration.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, which include cash accounts and short-term cash investments at
banks, cash balances and liquid funds in parking facilities, as well as funds in transit, have
remaining terms of up to three months at the date of addition and are measured at amortised
cost. A provision for risks has been formed.

**Pension provisions**

The actuarial measurement of pension provisions is based on the projected unit credit method
for defined benefit pension plans as stipulated in IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Under this
method, consideration is given to both the pensions and acquired vested benefits known at the
balance sheet date and the expected future salary and pension increases and other actuarial
assumptions. The calculation of the pension obligations is based on an actuarial survey that
takes biometric calculation bases into consideration. The interest rate to calculate the
obligations’ present value is calculated, as a matter of principle, on the basis of yields for firstclass fixed interest corporate bonds for the respective currency zone with matching maturities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience-based adjustments and changes in the
actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income under equity in the
period in which they occur, with no effect on profit or loss, and without later recycling to the
income statement. The interest component contained in the pension expense is shown in the
financial result. Income from plan assets is also shown as interest income. The service cost is
presented under personnel expenses.

The amounts to be paid as part of defined contribution plans are recognised through profit and
loss when the contributions are due and are presented as a component of personnel expense.
Contribution prepayments are capitalised if the prepayments will lead to a refund or a reduction
of future payments.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions are formed for legal or constructive obligations to third parties which arise
from a past event, which are likely to lead to an outflow of resources in the future, and whose
amount can be reliably estimated. The probability that an outflow of resources will occur must
be over 50% (more likely than not). Provisions are formed only for legal or constructive
obligations to third parties. Provisions that do not lead to an outflow of resources in the
subsequent year are recognised at the settlement amount discounted to the balance sheet
date, if the discounting gives rise to a material interest effect. The discounting calculation is
based on interest rates before taxes, which reflect current market expectations concerning the
interest effect and, if required, risks specific to the relevant debt. The settlement amount also


-----

as of 31 December 2020

includes expected cost increases.

**Financial instruments**

According to IFRS 9 in combination with IAS 32, financial instruments are contractual
arrangements that give rise to a financial asset at one entity and a financial liability or an equity
instrument at another entity. If financial assets’ trading date and settlement date do not
coincide, the date of performance is authoritative for the initial recognition. The initial
measurement of a financial instrument is generally at fair value, with the exception of trade
receivables, which are recognised at transaction price as a matter of principle. For purposes
of the value measurement, IFRS 9 differentiates between the following categories of assets:

- Financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss,

- Financial instruments recognised directly in equity,

- Financial instruments recognised at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities are classified into two categories, by contrast:

- Financial instruments held for trading which are recognised at fair value through profit and
loss and

- Other financial liabilities.

Subsequent measurement is performed at fair value or amortised cost applying the effective
interest rate method, depending on the categorisation of the financial instruments. The fair
value corresponds to the market or stock exchange price. If no active market or exchange
exists for a given financial instrument, where possible the fair value is determined through the
use of financial mathematical methods such as generally accepted option price models or by
discounting future cash flows at the market interest rate. Amortised cost corresponds to the
acquisition cost less redemption payments, value impairments and the reversal of any
difference between the acquisition cost and the amount repayable at final maturity in
application of the effective interest rate method.

Investments are measured at fair value with no effect on income. On disposal, the change in
value recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained earnings. Dividends
are recognised in the income statement unless they represent a capital repayment.

Unless otherwise specified, the fair value of current financial instruments, cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables corresponds to their carrying amounts, due
to such items’ short-term nature.

According to IFRS 9, the impairment model used is based on expected credit losses. The
impairment provisions must be applied to debt instruments that are subsequently measured at
amortised cost or at fair value through equity. Under the general approach, expected losses
are recognised as soon as the asset is recognised. The standard provides for a three-stage
model for determining expected losses.

Under the general approach, financial instruments are allocated to the first stage on initial
recognition and a provision for possible loan losses is recognised by recognising an impairment
loss in the amount of the credit losses expected to be incurred within the next twelve months.
A transfer to Stage 2 occurs if a significant increase in credit risk exists and the provision for
potential loan losses is calculated for the losses expected over the entire term. Whether a
significant increase in credit risk has occurred is assessed by comparing the original probability
of default at the time the instrument was acquired with the probability of default on the balance
sheet date. A significant increase in the credit risk has occurred if the loan is overdue by more
than 30 days. If an objective indication exists, a transfer to Stage 3 takes place. As a
consequence, interest income is to be determined in relation to the net carrying amount, while
interest income for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 continues to be determined in relation to the
gross carrying amount. Objective evidence of impairment is assumed in the case of overdue
payments of 90 days and 360 days for fines, respectively. If a low default risk exists on the key


-----

as of 31 December 2020

date (e.g. investment grade), the financial instrument is assigned to the first step without further
examination.

IFRS 9 also contains a simplified approach for trade receivables and contract assets in
accordance with IFRS 15. Under the simplified approach, an impairment loss is recognised for
all financial instruments, irrespective of credit quality, to the extent of the expected losses over
the remaining term. As a consequence, a blanket allocation to Stage 2 is made on addition
and, in the event of objective evidence of impairment, a transfer to Stage 3 is made.

For trade receivables and contract assets, impairment is determined using the simplified
approach, while cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets are impaired using the
general model.

For risk provisions for financial instruments classified at amortised cost, the credit risks of the
individual debtors are first segmented on the basis of common default risk characteristics. For
this purpose, the respective debtors are classified according to the type of business
relationship. A diversified analysis of the debtors is performed when determining risk
provisions. The analysis includes information on past payment arrears, current market
information such as credit default swaps and future assessments and, in particular, country
risks and external rating assessments. In the simplified approach, this information is processed
and a risk matrix is derived from it. In the general approach, risk provisions for major borrowers
are calculated on an individual basis. However, clusters are formed with less significant debtors
in order to calculate risk provisions.

The quantification of expected credit losses essentially relates to three risk parameters:
probability of default, loss rate in the event of default and the actual utilisation in the event of
default. Credit risks and associated risk provisions are reviewed regularly and adjusted
accordingly. During the reporting period, no adjustments were made to the estimation
procedure for risk provisions.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Pursuant to IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments must be recognised at fair value as of
the balance sheet date, independently of the purpose or intention for concluding such
arrangements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments can be positive or negative.
The recognition of changes in fair values – recognition through profit or loss or income-neutral
recognition under equity – depends on whether the derivative financial instruments are
designated into an effective hedge within the meaning of IFRS 9 or not. In the absence of
hedge accounting, the changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. By contrast, if an effective hedge relationship
pursuant to IFRS 9 exists, the hedge arrangement is recognised.

At present, the Group only hedges underlying transactions through cash flow hedges. At the
start of the hedge relationship, both the hedge relationship and the risk management objectives
and strategies of the Group with respect to the hedging are formally established and
documented. The documentation includes information on the determination of the hedging
instrument, the underlying transaction or the hedged transaction and the type of risks being
hedged as well as a description of the manner in which the company determined the
effectiveness of the hedging instrument with respect to the compensation of risks arising from
changes in fair value or the cash flows from the hedged underlying transaction. Such hedging
relationships are considered to be highly effective in offsetting the risks from changes in cash
flows as all significant value-creating parameters of the hedged item and the hedging
instrument match at the time of designation into a hedging relationship. In the case of cash
flow hedges, the effective portion of the change in the market value from a hedging instrument
is recognised directly in equity, net of deferred taxes, while the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in profit or loss. The amounts recognised in equity are reclassified to profit and
loss in the period in which the hedged transaction affects the period result, in other words, at
the point when the hedged financial income or financial expenses are recognised or when an
expected sale is carried out. If a hedge leads to recognition as a non-financial asset or a non

-----

as of 31 December 2020

financial liability, the amounts recognised in equity become part of the acquisition costs of the
non-financial asset or non-financial liability as of the date of addition.

If a highly probable forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur,
the amounts previously recognised in equity are immediately reclassified to profit and loss.
When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement
or rollover into another hedging instrument, the amounts previously recognised in equity
remain as a separate component of equity until the highly probable forecast transaction or firm
commitment occurs.

**Contingencies (contingent liabilities and contingent claims)**

Contingencies are possible obligations or assets arising from past events whose existence or
occurrence (or non-occurrence) depends on one or more uncertain future events, which do not
lie within the Group’s complete control. Contingent liabilities can also comprise current
obligations arising from past events where the outflow of resources representing an economic
benefit is improbable or the scope of the obligation cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent
liabilities are recognised at fair value if they are acquired as part of a corporate acquisition.
Contingent receivables are not recognised. To the extent the possibility of an outflow of an
economic benefit is not unlikely, disclosures on contingent liabilities are provided in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements. The same applies for contingent receivables to the
extent their inflow is likely.

**Income tax / deferred tax**

The income tax expense is comprised of the sum total of current tax expenses and deferred
tax. The current tax expense is determined on the basis of the taxable income for the year.
The Group’s liability for current tax expense is calculated on the basis of applicable tax rates.
Deferred taxes are measured in accordance with the “liability method” stipulated in IAS 12
“Income Taxes”. This means that, with the exception of goodwill arising from consolidation,
deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and quasi-permanent differences between the
values recognised for assets and liabilities in the IFRS and tax balance sheet, irrespective of
the period, in which these differences balance out. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated on the basis of tax rates which are valid or are expected to apply in the respective
countries at the recognition dates. This is based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that are
valid or announced as of the balance sheet date. Income taxes relating to items that are
recognised directly in equity are recognised under equity and not in profit or loss. Deferred tax
assets are formed for losses carried forward to the extent it is probable that, in the future,
sufficient taxable income will be available that can be offset against the loss carry forwards.

**Leases**

A lease is an agreement that transfers the right to use an asset (the leased asset) for an agreed
period of time in return for payment.
In principle, the lessee’s rights and obligations for all leases must be recognised on the balance
sheet as rights of use and lease liabilities. Rights of use are reported under property, plant and
equipment, as they are recorded under the same balance sheet items as own assets. The
lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments at the time the
leased asset is ready for use. Leasing liabilities include the following leasing payments:

  - fixed payments, less leasing incentives to be paid by the lessor,
  - variable payments linked to an index or interest rate,
  - expected residual value payments from residual value guarantees

The measurement of the lease liability also includes lease payments based on a sufficiently
secure utilisation of extension options. If determinable, the lease is discounted at the interest
rate on which the lease is implicitly based. Otherwise, discounting is applied at the marginal
borrowing rate. In determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Group applies the risk-free
interest rate as a starting point and adjusts it to reflect the lessee’s credit risk. Further


-----

as of 31 December 2020

adjustments are applied for the term of the lease and the currency.

The rights of use are valued at cost and include:

  - the amount arising from the initial measurement of the lease liability,
  - at or before the provision of lease payments made, less incentives received,
  - initial direct costs, and
  - dismantling obligations.

In subsequent measurement, discounting applied to the carrying amount of the lease liability
is reversed at the interest rate applied and reduced by lease payments made. The right of use
is amortised on a scheduled basis over the lease term.

With the exception of cleaning machines and parking space monitoring sensors, the
recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 16 are not applied to leases where the
underlying asset is of minor value. Leases whose term ends within 12 months after the date of
first-time application are recognised as short-term leases under expenses. In the case of
contracts that contain non-leasing components in addition to leasing components, the option
of not separating these components is used.

Further disclosures on leases can be found in note (41) Information about leases.

**Recognition and reporting of sales revenue**

Sales revenues include all proceeds from the Group’s normal business activities. Sales
revenues are reported without value added tax. The five-step model in accordance with IFRS
15 was applied to revenue from contracts with customers. The Group earns sales revenues
and income from the performance of services in the area of parking facility management,
including the collection of monetary fines from parking space monitoring in the event of
corresponding violations. In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when the
customer determines the use of the transferred services and substantially benefits from them.
When a contract is concluded, APCOA makes an assessment as to whether it is acting as
principal or agent. The following criteria are particularly relevant:

   - which of the parties has collective bargaining autonomy,

   - which party determines the hours of operation,

   - which party determines frequencies of patrols, when violations are punishable by fines,

   - which party determines the operational structure of the normal operating activities.

Revenues from short-term parkers comprise the short-term provision of parking space to
customers. Revenue is realised while the parking space is used. As the use of the parking
space usually takes place on one day and the end of the service provision coincides with the
time of payment, the revenues from short-term parkers are recognised at this time.

Long-term parking relationships are rental relationships with customers that grant the customer
the right to use the parking space for a certain period of time for a previously contractually
agreed fee. Revenues from these leases are invoiced monthly, quarterly or annually, and
recognised on a period-related basis.

Sales revenues from management agreements are generated with the provision of
management services for a contracting party, such as maintenance, monitoring, fee collection
etc. In return, the Group receives a management fee. This can have both fixed and variable
components. Revenue from management contracts is also recognised on a period-related
basis when the customer receives the benefit of the service and at the same time uses the
service while it is being rendered.

In recognising revenue in the Park&Guard and On-Street area, the Group generates revenue
from the issuance of penalties on leased spaces with the parker as customer and similar
services for management contracts. Revenue is recognised in relation to a point in time and


-----

as of 31 December 2020

depending on whether it is probable that the fines will be paid. If parking space monitoring is
performed on behalf of the landowner, revenue is recognised on a period-related basis, and
only the management fee is reported as revenue.

Advertising, e.g. on tickets or in car parks, is also realised on a period-related basis, as the
tickets are distributed over several months, or the advertising is displayed in the car parks over
a specific period.

Income from parking space rentals agreed in connection with the concession agreement is
recognised on an accrual basis as presented above.

**Recognition of other income and interest income**

Other income is recognised on the basis both of a point in time and over a period. Interest
income is recognised pro rata temporis.

**Government grants**

Government grants are recognised at fair value if reasonable assurance exists that the grant
will be received, and the Group will comply with all attached conditions. Government grants
are to be recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the entity
recognises as expenses the related costs which the government grants are intended to
compensate. The grants received are deducted from the corresponding expenses. If no
corresponding expenses exist to offset the grants received, they are reported under other
income.

**Expense recognition**

Other expenses are recognised when the service is utilised or when the expense is incurred.
Interest payments are expensed pro rata temporis.
### 3. Notes to the consolidated income statement

**(11) Sales revenues**

The Group generates revenues in the area of parking facilities management. The revenues
are composed as follows:


**2020**


**2019**


**Sales revenues according to sales type** **T€** **T€**

Short-term parking 222,123 383,105

Sales deduction (4,489) (5,745)
**Total** **531,937** **720,620**

Within the context of agency business and lease agreements, revenues from parking facilities
monitoring are generated by the issuance of parking tickets for incorrect parking on private
properties, while “On-Street” revenues are generated by issuing parking tickets for incorrect
parking on public properties.

Other services mainly include income from the charging-on of operating costs as part of
management agreements in the amount of T€ 10,602 (previous year: T€ 13,082),
reimbursements of other administration and operating costs, and construction services in the
amount of T€ 1,517 (previous year: T€ 6,832), fees paid to the company by taxi businesses for
the use of parking space located on the business premises of the company in the amount of
T€ 770 (previous year: T€ 7,917) and income from advertising activities in the amount of T€
784 (previous year: T€ 1,068).


-----

as of 31 December 2020

Revenues from Park&Guard and “On-Street” are recorded on the basis of a point in time, while
revenues from management contracts and from long-term parking are recorded on a periodrelated basis. Revenues from other services are mainly recorded on a period-related basis.

**Total** **15,909** **15,108**

The income from negative variable rentals under IFRS 16.38(b) in the financial year under
review is attributable to the amendments to IFRS 16: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions.
See also note 3 for further information.

Income from the disposal of property, plant and equipment in the 2019 financial year includes
proceeds of T€ 377 from a sale and leaseback transaction.

In the year under review, as in the previous year, miscellaneous other income includes income
from the reimbursement of insurance claims, income unrelated to the accounting period, and
compensation payments. The year under review also includes government grants in the
amount of T€ 278.

**(13) Lease expenses**

The company’s lease expenses in the 2020 financial year are composed as follows:

**adjusted**


**2020**


**2019**


**Lease expenses** **T€** **T€**

Variable 121,076 200,443
Fixed 5,685 7,075
Other lease expense 115 135
Incentive agreements 91 Government grants (4,078) **Total** **122,889** **207,652**


-----

as of 31 December 2020

Based on mostly long-term lease agreements, the company is obligated to make fixed lease
instalments as well as performance-based variable lease instalments. In this context, the
variable component of the lease expense is generally calculated on a percentage basis in
relation to the sales revenues generated. As in the previous year, the fixed lease expenses for
2020 relate to expenses for short-term leases or low-value leases. The other lease expense
consists exclusively of lease instalments for advertising space.

The income from government grants received in the 2020 financial year relates to
compensation for fixed lease expenses, which were issued on a country-specific basis in the
context of the coronavirus crisis.

**(14) Cost of materials and purchased services**

The cost of materials and of purchased services is composed as follows:

**adjusted**

**Costs of materials** **2020** **2019**

**and of purchased services** **T€** **T€**
Cost of maintenance and repair 21,478 19,386
Ancillary operating costs 16,491 14,830
External other services 12,892 19,233
Consumables 4,971 8,335
Other 1,795 1,645
**Total** **57,628** **63,428**

Maintenance repair costs rose year-on-year and include expenses for maintenance of T€
14,299 (previous year: T€ 13,635) and expenses for the repair of technical equipment and
buildings of T€ 7,179 (previous year: T€ 5,751).

External other services mainly relate to fees from external service providers in connection with
parking space monitoring of T€ 4,552 (previous year: T€ 6,551), mainly in the United Kingdom.
Significant further external services include expenses for payment cards of T€ 2,790 (prior
year: T€ 5,186), T€ 1,522 (prior year: T€ 2,045) for cleaning services, T€ 884 (prior year:  T€
1,380) for cash management expenses in connection with customer payments received and
T€ 614 (prior year: T€ 919) for snow removal.

The higher maintenance expenses (T€ 664) relate primarily to car parks in the UK and Ireland.
The increase in expenses for maintenance and repairs (T€ 1,428) mainly relates to garages in
Belgium and Denmark.

The decrease in external other services is mainly due to lower expenses for Park&Guard  (T€
-1,998), especially in the United Kingdom, Norway, Italy and Belgium, and reduced transaction
costs for payment cards (T€ -2,396), mainly in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, a decrease
in expenses for cleaning services (T€ -523) as well as expenses for snow removal (T€ -305) is
reported.

Ancillary operating costs comprise mainly energy costs of T€ 5,433 (previous year: T€ 5,513),
other ancillary costs (e.g. water) of T€ 8,193 (previous year: T€ 6,194), and expenses for public
charges in an amount of T€ 2,865 (previous year: T€ 3,119).

The decrease in energy costs of T€ -79 is primarily due to lower energy costs in car parks in
Italy. The increase in other ancillary costs of T€ 1,999 arises mainly from the overall increase
in operating costs in Germany.

Expenses for supplies mainly included the costs of general operating supplies required for
sustaining operating activities and merchandise.

The year-on-year decrease of T€ -3,363 is mainly due to lower expenses in Poland and
Denmark for Pay&Display (P&D) machines.

**(15) Personnel expenses**

The personnel expenses are composed as follows:


**2020**

**Total** **164,119** **181,997**

##### Wages and salaries for the financial year 2020 include bonus payments to the management in the amount of T€ 7,086 (previous year: T€ 5,103). In addition, the total
includes severance payments incurred during the reorganisation in the amount of T€ 3,925
(previous year: T€ 502) made to employees who had left the company.

Pension expenses mainly comprise contributions to defined contribution pension plans in an
amount of T€ 4,621 (previous year: T€ 4,824), as well as additions to pension provisions.

Further information about pension provisions can be found in note (36) Provisions for pensions
and similar obligations.

In the financial year under review, government grants in the amount of T€ 8,374 were
recognised as a reduction in personnel expenses. These are different governmental aid
programs that were set up in the context of the coronavirus crisis in several countries where
APCOA is active.

The number of employees reports the following changes as of 31 December 2020:

**Staff** **31.12.2020** **31.12.2019**
Workers 4,237 4,928
Employees 404 428
Management 109 111
**Total** **4,750** **5,467**

**(16) Other expenses**

The company’s other expenses related to the following items:

**adjusted**

**2020** **2019**

**Other expenses** **T€** **T€**
Audit and consulting costs 11,725 10,107
IT expenses 7,313 6,186
Car pool (leasing, gasoline, etc.) 5,913 7,102
Expenses for temporary workers 5,494 7,947

Bank charges 511 562
Miscellaneous other expenses 12,220 14,400
**Total** **60,528** **66,599**

Other expenses decreased by T€ 6,071 in 2020, mainly due to the reduction in revenue in the
context of the coronavirus crisis and the measures taken as a consequence. This is very clearly
reflected in the decrease for temporary employees (T€ -2,453), business travel (T€ -2,161),
vehicle fleet (T€ -1,189) and marketing expenses (T€ -896).


-----

as of 31 December 2020

The increase in audit and consulting fees in the amount of T€ 1,619 is mainly due to higher
expenses for M&A and auditing. The T€ 1,127 increase in IT expenses reflects increased
digitalisation and flexibility to ensure the organisation’s ability to operate.

Miscellaneous other expenses mainly include other administrative expenses of T€ 8,250
(previous year: T€ 2,633), public-sector levies of T€ 1,689 (previous year: T€ 1,932), and  T€
1,019 of costs for recruitment and further training (previous year: T€ 1,802).

In the financial year under review, government grants in the amount of T€ 2,077 were
recognised as a reduction in other expenses.

**(17) Write-downs/write-ups and impairments of intangible assets, property, plant and**
**equipment and rights of use**

Write-downs/write-ups of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and rights of use
assets comprise both amortisation/deprecation and impairment losses, as well as reversals of
impairment losses, and are comprised as follows as of 31 December 2020:

**adjusted**
**2020** **2019**
**Amortisation / depreciation** **T€** **T€**
Scheduled amortisation / depreciation 157,413 145,887
Non-scheduled amortisation / depreciation 16,786 564
Reversal of write-down - (1,445)
**Total** **174,199** **145,006**

Further details concerning amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses are provided in
notes (21) Intangible assets, and (22) Property, plant and equipment and rights of use. The
reversals of impairment losses in 2019 relate to lease usage rights impaired as part of the firsttime adoption of IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019.

**(18) Financial income**


**2020**


**2019**


**Financial income** **T€** **T€**

Book value adjustment 12,645 Currency gains 3,821 1,864
Financial income from third parties and banks 171 208
Other financial income - 111
**Total** **16,638** **2,183**

The increase in financial income is mainly due to the adjustment of carrying amounts and
currency gains recognised in profit or loss.

The adjustment of the carrying amount through profit or loss was made in the context of the
increase of the existing facility by T€ 94,000 in February 2020. The income is mainly due to
the reduction in the interest rate.

Currency gains reported under financial income result from the periodic measurement of loans
denominated in foreign currencies and the cash pool accounts in relation to the affiliated
companies. The cash pool accounts are managed in the respective local currency. Further
disclosures on foreign currency loans are provided in notes (34) Financial liabilities, and (43)
Group risk management.

**(19) Financial expenses**


**adjusted**

**2020** **2019**

**Financial expenses** **T€** **T€**
Interest expenses leasing 52,079 50,561
Financial expenses with banks 28,790 19,551
Book value adjustment 16,383 Currency losses 4,941 3,845
Other financial expenses 480 569
**Total** **102,673** **74,526**

The increase in financial expenses is mainly due to the adjustment of the carrying amount
recognised in profit or loss and the interest expenses for banks.

The higher financial expenses due to banks in 2020 in the year under review are due, firstly,
to a regular drawdown of the revolving credit facility. In addition, the bank loan, which was
taken out in March 2017 following the redemption of the existing syndicated loan, was
increased by € 94 million nominal in February 2020, by a further € 68 million nominal in  May
2020, and by € 10 million nominal in June 2020.

The adjustment to the carrying amount through profit or loss was made as part of the increase
in the existing facility. The expense is mainly due to the increase in the agreed interest rate of
Facility B from 3.25% to 3.75% as well as the newly borrowed Facility B2 with an interest rate
of 7.25%.

The currency losses relate to interest-bearing liabilities to both banks and associated
companies denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, such as euros, pound
sterling, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kroner, held as loan currency at the companies with
other functional currencies. The currency losses are primarily due to the bank loan, which was
denominated entirely in euros. This led to corresponding currency losses in the 2020 financial
year, mainly at the subsidiaries in Norway and the UK.

Please refer to the comments in the note (43) Group risk management, for more information
about financial income and expenses.

**(20)** **Income tax**

Corporation tax in Germany stands at 15% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on the assessed
corporation tax. In Germany, fiscal units for income tax purposes exist between APCOA
Parking Holdings GmbH as the controlling entity and APCOA Parking Deutschland GmbH and
Park & Control PAC GmbH as controlled companies.

The average trade tax rate was 15% (previous year: 15%). The individual trade tax rate
depends on the established municipal factors applied in the municipalities in which the
company is active.

The total tax rate for the financial year 2020 was 31% (previous year: 31%).

The inventory of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of 31 December 2020 was
allocable to the following balance sheet items and losses carried forward:

- According to IAS 12, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities recorded for the same taxation authority must be netted if
they satisfy certain criteria.

Deferred taxes reported under equity result from the revaluation of pension obligations.

The interest carry forward of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH amounts to T€ 51,106 (previous
year: T€ 32,578), of which T€ 2,933 (previous year: T€ 8,771) was recognised as it is probable
that it can be utilised in future periods.

The deferred tax liabilities allocable to intangible assets in the amount of T€ 33,640 (previous
year: T€ 35,422) are attributable mainly to intangible assets, contractual relationships and
brand marks identified in connection with the corporate acquisitions realised in 2007. Deferred
tax liabilities reflecting appreciations in value as well as the recognition of assets as part of
purchase price allocations are reduced within the scope of the write-down of the assets over
their useful lives. They will not be cash-effective in the future.

Deferred tax assets in an amount of T€ 25,800 (previous year: T€ 28,405) are non-current.
Deferred tax liabilities in an amount of T€ 32,158 (previous year: T€ 35,808) are non-current.

The amounts of expenses and income relating to deferred taxes and taxes on income were
composed as follows in the financial year:

**adjusted**
**2020** **2019**
**Current and deferred taxes** **T€** **T€**
Current tax expense (764) 9,152
Deferred tax income (2,201) (6,629)
**Total tax expense / (income)** **(2,965)** **2,523**

Current tax income is attributable to the financial year under review. Tax income of T€ 427
(previous year: tax expense of T€ 531) arose from prior periods.

The following table shows the tax reconciliation statement concerning the income tax expense
(or income) expected in the respective financial year with the tax expense (or income) actually
reported. The expected tax expense (or income) was determined by multiplying earnings

The reported tax rate differences derive from the difference between the Group tax rate and
the individual companies’ individual tax rates, as well as from changes to tax rates that affect
the calculation of deferred tax.

In total, tax loss carry forwards exist in an amount of T€ 165,207 (previous year: T€ 93,414).
Today’s assessment regarding the usability of tax losses carried forward may change in future
years depending on the company’s respective financial performance and, in such case, would
require that the deferred taxes be adjusted to the losses carried forward.

In relation to tax loss carry forwards that existed in 2020, no deferred tax assets were formed
for an amount of T€ 132,245 (previous year: T€ 64,817), as realisation of the tax assets is not
likely due to the positive tax results in the planning period under IAS 12. With the exception of
the tax loss carry forward in Luxembourg (here: 17 years), the reported tax loss carry forwards
can be carried forward indefinitely in accordance with IAS 12.81 (e).

As in the previous year, no deferred taxes were formed for differences arising in connection
with interests in subsidiaries (so-called outside basis differences), as the foreign subsidiaries’
profits are available to them for reinvestment purposes.

The useful life of the brand marks is unlimited, as APCOA may use them without any time limit, and no plans exist to relinquish the brand marks
in the future. As in the previous year, as of 31 December 2020 no impairment related to goodwill, trademarks or contractual relationships.
Impairment losses of T€ 1,886 in the current financial year mainly relate to software applications and concept applications of the German
subsidiaries whose further use or development is no longer planned.

The change in the scope of consolidation in the 2020 financial year relates to the acquisition of subsidiaries during the year; see also note (1)
General.

**Goodwill impairment test – sensitivity analysis**

Given a ±1% change in weighted average cost of capital, the following sensitivities arise in relation to the excess of the recoverable amount over
the carrying amount of the cash-generating units:

The overall decrease in the surplus compared to the previous year, especially in Germany and Denmark, is due to the reduction in planning
assumptions due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The “APCOA” brand mark as well as the “EuroPark” brand mark were acquired as part of the acquisition of APCOA PARKING Group. The carrying
amount of the “APCOA” brand mark stands at T€ 23,185 as of the reporting date (previous year: T€ 23,185). The carrying amount of the “EuroPark”
brand mark stands at T€ 3,071 as of the reporting date (previous year: T€ 3,260). The brand marks have an indefinite useful life. The brands are
being utilised to further expand the Group. The “APCOA” and “EuroPark” brand marks were tested for impairment in the financial year under review.
This entailed calculating the recoverable amount as the capital value of the future licensing fee that is saved that would be incurred if a fee were
to be paid to a third party to utilise the brand marks. The underlying data are based on the management’s past empirical data and expectations
of future market trends. In the financial year under review, as in the previous year, no impairment losses or need to make up for impairment losses
were identified.

as of 31 December 2020

The property, plant and equipment are subject to reservations of ownership and restraints on
disposal in the amount of T€ 1,037 as of 31 December 2020 (previous year: T€ 1,171). Moreover,
debts were collateralised through assigning property, plant and equipment in an amount of   T€
6,156 (previous year: T€ 5,844). As of the balance sheet date, contractual obligations concerning
purchases of property, plant and equipment were reported in the amount of T€ 843 (previous
year: T€ 221). This mainly relates to contractual obligations in Italy for the purchase of technical
equipment.

The impairment losses of T€ 11,955 (prior year: T€ 515) on rights of use assets in the financial
year under review relate to rights of use from leased parking spaces and originate mainly from
subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and to a lesser extent from Germany, and reflect their
expected negative future business trend. The recoverable amount of the 17 rights of use from
leased parking spaces impaired in 2020 stands at T€ 33,623 as of the end of the financial year
under review. The recoverable amounts are based on the value in use; the discount rates used
correspond to those of the regular impairment test (note 10, Accounting and measurement
principles). An amount of T€ 2,938 relates to impairment losses on technical equipment at the
German subsidiaries, most of which was used for Park&Guard and whose costs are no longer
expected to be recoverable due to the expected negative future business trend. An amount of
T€ 8 (previous year: T€ 50) relates to buildings on land owned by a subsidiary in Sweden. In the
previous year, write-ups of T€ 1,445 were recognised.

**(23)** **Investments in equity accounted companies**

APCOA holds a 13.33% interest in AGILE PARKING SOLUTIONS PRIVATE LIMITED
(associated company) and a 50% interest in ParcBrux BVBA (joint venture). Both equity
accounted investments are non-significant associates or joint ventures in the meaning of IFRS
12.

The equity investments belong to the category of financial instruments measured at fair value
with no effect on income and consist of interests in unlisted companies with a shareholding of
less than 20%. Assets are measured at fair value. The change in fair value is recognised directly
in other comprehensive income as these investments are not part of the core business but are
held for strategic purposes.

Provisions for losses on loans and advances are grouped on the basis of similar default risk
characteristics arising from the various services and jointly tested for impairment and, if
necessary, written down. Historical default data is taken into consideration in this context.
Furthermore, macroeconomic inputs such as country ratings are included to take future
developments into consideration. These are utilised in order to create devaluation matrices that
adequately reflect the receivables’ risk structure. Specific defaults lead to the derecognition of
the relevant receivables. An indication of a potential default event is defined as an overdue event
of 360 days, as no further settlement is expected at this point in time. Receivables are adjusted
to reflect the expected realisable payments at values based on past experience. Derecognition
occurs at the latest after two years, or in the fines business concurrently with the default event.

A year-on-year increase in impairment adjustments of T€ 373 was reported in the year under
review. This can be attributed to the expansion of business operations in previous years and a
slight increase in risk provisions in the financial year.

Of the receivables for leased parking spaces, T€ 1,452 (previous year: T€ 1,732) have been
deposited as collateral, which are not part of the risk provision.

The impairments of trade receivables report the following changes:

Cash and cash equivalents were comprised of bank balances with a maximum term of three
months, cash in hand, cash in parking facilities and cash in transit. As of the balance sheet date
accounts with a total balance of T€ 55,467 (previous year: T€ 26,158) were pledged as security
for the credit agreement. However, these accounts are freely available for the financial
arrangements of APCOA PARKING Group. The bank balances that are subject to disposal

The classification of the credit risk of the payment instruments into the individual risk classes was
based on the rating of the individual banks. The expected credit loss was approximated using
CDS spreads, which already include forward-looking information.

**(30)** **Subscribed capital**

The subscribed capital amounted to € 103,896 as of 31 December 2020 (previous year:
€ 103,896).

The subscribed capital is divided into eight company shares: one Class A company share with a
nominal value of € 25,000, one Class A company share with a nominal value of € 4,250, one
Class B company share (non-voting) with a nominal value of € 65,000, one Class B company
share (non-voting) with a nominal value of € 5,692, two Class B company shares (non-voting)
each with a nominal value of € 1,186, one Class B company share (non-voting) with a nominal
value of € 949 and one Class B company share (non-voting) with a nominal value of € 633. As
of the balance sheet date all shares were fully paid in.

**(31)** **Capital reserve**

The capital reserve amounted to T€ 768,058 as of 31 December 2020 (previous year: T€
818,058). By shareholder resolution on 31 January 2020, € 90,000,000 of the capital reserve was
released and distributed to the shareholder in cash. By shareholder resolution dated 19 May 2020,
the shareholder contributed € 40,000,000 in cash capital to the company’s capital reserve.

as of 31 December 2020

**(32)** **Other reserves**

The hedging reserve includes the portion of profit or loss arising from a hedging instrument used
as a cash flow hedge and determined as an effective hedge instrument.

The revaluation from defined benefit pension obligations includes the revaluation of defined
benefit plans and similar obligations which are reported with neutral effect on profit or loss in the
period in which they occur.

The currency translation reserve serves to recognise differences from the currency translation of
the foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements.

**(33)** **Revenue reserves**

The revenue reserves are comprised of the loss of the financial year under review and the
accumulated losses of previous years, which are carried forward to the new accounting periods.

In the previous year, as a consequence of the first-time application of IFRS 16, an amount of T€
1,623 was recognised as of 1 January 2019, as well as deferred taxes of T€ 320 recognised in
relation to this.

**(34)** **Financial liabilities**

The financial liabilities are composed as follows as of the balance sheet date:

Derivative financial instruments 1,502 - - 1,502


The derivative financial instruments are comprised exclusively of interest rate swaps
denominated in DKK which are included in a cash flow hedge relationship with a view to hedging
the interest risks from floating-rate lease liabilities.

The Group is mainly financed by a syndicated loan. The syndicated loan comprises a bullet loan
of T€ 514,000 (Facility B, previous year: T€ 420,000) and a bullet loan of T€ 78,000 (Facility B2)
maturing in March 2024, a guarantee facility of T€ 30,000 maturing in March 2023 and a revolving
credit facility of T€ 35,000 maturing in March 2023. As of 31 December 2020, the guarantee line
had been drawn in the amount of T€ 19,431, and the revolving credit facility in the amount of T€
1,003. The revolving credit facility was utilised by drawing on a bank guarantee.

Covenants based on the consolidated figures of APCOA PARKING Group before IFRS 16 were
agreed in the syndicated lending agreement. The management of APCOA PARKING Group and
the syndicate banks regularly review compliance with these covenants.

This includes all instruments held on 31 December 2020 and for which payments have already
been contractually agreed. Budgeted figures for future new liabilities are not included. All
foreign currency amounts are translated applying the spot rate on the reporting date. The
variable interest payments from financial instruments were calculated on the basis of interest
rates last fixed before 31 December 2020. Financial liabilities due on demand are always
allocated to the earliest timeslot.

Collateral for the credit lines was delivered through assigning company shares according to
the respective national law at the following Group companies:

In addition, third-party receivables (including trade receivables) and receivables from
consolidated subsidiaries have been assigned under the relevant national law (for example,
collateral assignments or liens). Such receivables due from consolidated companies as well
as the assigned shares in consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated as part of consolidation.
For this reason, these items were not included in the net carrying amounts of the leased assets.
The carrying amount of the receivables assigned to third parties amounted to T€ 26,651 as of
the balance sheet date (previous year: T€ 39,045). Furthermore, bank deposits have also been
assigned as collateral to credit agreements. The carrying amount of the assigned deposits
stands at T€ 55,467 as of the balance sheet date (previous year: T€ 26,158).

A cross-guarantee system exists between the borrowers and other significant Group
companies, which have provided guarantees as personal securities. The lender is entitled to
realisation if the credit lines are cancelled, which for example is possible if the borrowers do
not satisfy obligations arising from the interest and redemption payments of the financial
liabilities. In addition, global surety agreements are in place for the entire assets of the
companies in the UK.

The provisions for contingent losses contain the future results for loss-making contracts that
do not fall within the scope of IFRS 16.

The rental provisions contain the estimated expenses for parts of rental payments, where the
amount and point in time are uncertain.

Provisions for personnel mainly include provisions for personnel costs in connection with the
reorganisation of APCOA PARKING Group for severance and redundancy payments of T€
2,314 and for restructuring of T€ 1,442.

Furthermore, miscellaneous other provisions mainly relate to the Italian company APCOA
Parking Italia S.p.A. in an amount of T€ 2,391 (previous year: T€ 3,492).

The Italian subsidiary has received tax assessments from the municipal authorities in Palermo
for garbage collection fees (Tarsu) for the years 2006 through to 2013. In the 2019 financial
year, the company concluded an agreement with the landlord under which the latter undertakes
to assume all claims of the City of Palermo arising from waste tax. In total, the Italian company
has formed provisions of T€ 581 for possible payment obligations as of 31 December 2020
and capitalised a recourse claim in the same amount.

**(36)** **Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

Staff of APCOA PARKING Group are granted pension entitlements according to different
programs. These cover both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to an independent,
external entity (fund). Defined contribution plans exist in Austria, Ireland, the UK, Norway,
Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Once the contributions have been paid, the company

F-74


-----

as of 31 December 2020

incurs no further performance obligations or risks. The current contribution payments are
recognised as expenses for the current year in the operating result and amounted to a total of
T€ 4,605 in the 2020 financial year (previous year: T€ 4,545).

**Defined benefit plans**

All other pension plans are defined benefit plans and are subject to different pension
arrangements.

**Joint pension plan of several employers in Norway: This plan is based on participation in**
a joint pension plan in Norway in the form of legally specified employer’s contributions to
pensions (AFP). The pension plan includes also benefits for employees taking early retirement.
Employer’s contributions are salary-based and are paid for all employees through to their 62nd
birthdays.

**Defined benefit plan in Germany:** A defined benefit plan exists in Germany that arises
exclusively from pension entitlements acquired in the past. The pension benefits include oldage retirement benefits as well as disability benefits and benefits for surviving dependants in
line with the pension regulations. The benefit is contingent on the length of service and the
salary of the beneficiary.

**Defined benefit plan in Austria:** The pension scheme in Austria includes severance
payments required to be paid by the Group to employees engaged prior to 1 January 2003.
Employees engaged after 1 January 2004 are entitled to severance payments from the
employee pension fund (Mitarbeiterversorgungskasse). The severance payments for these
employees represent a defined contribution plan according to IAS 19.

**Defined benefit plan in Belgium:** Defined benefit plans exist in Belgium. The pension
obligations consist of four different plans (open and closed plans) and take into account future
salary increases, and the results include Belgian payroll taxes due on pension plans. Due to
the minimum guarantees, such plans are allocated to defined benefit plans according to IAS
19. Pension obligations in Belgium are included in the presentation of defined benefit plans for
the first time in the financial year under review. They were not included in previous years, as
they were immaterial for the Group overall.

**Defined benefit plan in the UK:** The United Kingdom pension scheme includes old-age
retirement and benefits for surviving dependants according to beneficiary, and benefits in the
event of the beneficiary’s death through an occupational accident. The benefit is contingent on
the professional status, years of company service and the salary of the beneficiaries.

**Other defined benefit plans: According to the Swiss Occupational Pension Act (BVG), all**
employers are required to provide employees with post-employment retirement benefits. The
pension benefits are financed through pension funds, so-called collective foundations, which
manage the pensions. Both employer and employee contributions are rendered to the pension
fund, whereby the company’s total contributions must correspond at least to the employee
contributions as set out in the plan terms. Given insufficient cover, either the employer or
employee contributions are increased, and a minimum rate of interest can be decided upon,
or other measures permitted by law. Due to the minimum guarantees, such plans are allocated
to defined benefit plans according to IAS 19. The following presentation includes the defined
benefit scheme of APCOA Parking Service Switzerland AG and of Real Estate Schaffhausen
GmbH.

The defined benefit plan of APCOA Parking Switzerland AG is not material for the Group. For
this reason, the company has refrained from presenting them in greater detail.

amount of T€ 1,074 (previous year T€ 1,258) and in Belgium in the amount of T€ 2,520
(previous year € 0).

The obligations connected with the defined benefit pension commitments are partly covered
by plan assets, comprising both reinsurance and separate pension vehicles. Plan assets are
currently deployed in the UK, Belgium and Switzerland. Assets in the UK are invested as

In Switzerland, the plan assets are invested up to an amount of T€ 1,750 (previous year:  T€
1,590) according to the strategy of the collective foundation (VZ BVG). A detailed analysis of
the asset allocation is not possible, and the assets are to be classified as “other investments” as
a consequence. A total of 100% of the assets are listed on an active market.

In Belgium, the obligations associated with defined benefit pension commitments are covered
by reinsured insurance contracts.

For the 2021 financial year, the Group anticipates contributions to defined benefit pension
plans amounting to a total of T€ 160 (previous year: T€ 166), and outgoing payments of T€ 155
(previous year: T€ 97).

In connection with the defined benefit pension plans, the company is exposed to various risks
such as general actuarial risks (longevity risk etc) and financial risk (interest-rate risk, capital
market risk, investment risks etc).


**Factors used in the calculation**
**of pension obligations**


**2020** **2019**


**Discounting factor**

Germany 0.40% 0.70%
Austria 0.50% 0.80%
Switzerland 0.20% 0.10%
Belgium 0.90% 1.10%
Italy 0.35% 0.60%
United Kingdom 1.90% 2.70%
**Long-term salary increases**

Germany 0.00% 0.00%
Austria 2.00% 2.00%
Switzerland 1.00% 1.00%
Belgium 0.00% 0.00%
Italy 0.00% 0.00%
United Kingdom 0.00% 0.00%
**Pension dynamics**

Germany 1.00% 0.10%

Switzerland 0.00% 0.00%
Belgium 1.80% 1.80%
Italy 1.50% 1.50%
United Kingdom 3.00% 3.00%

The weighted average term of the benefit obligation amounts to 19 years (previous year: 19
years) for APCOA Parking Service Switzerland AG and 23 years (previous year: 23 years) for
Real Estate Schaffhausen GmbH in Switzerland, 14 years (previous year: 14 years) in
Germany, 13 years (previous year: 14 years) in the United Kingdom, 13 years (previous year:
13 years) in Belgium, 10 years (previous year: 10 years) in Italy and 11 years (previous year:
10 years) in Austria.

An increase or decrease in the discounting factor by one half percentage point would reduce
the present value of the obligations from the Group’s internal pension schemes by T€ 688 or
lead to an increase of T€ 256, respectively. An increase or decrease in the pension trend by
one half percentage point would increase the present value of the obligations from the Group’s
internal pension schemes by T€ 119 or lead to a decrease of T€ 219, respectively.

The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an individual assumption with all other
assumptions remaining unchanged. In actual fact, deviations are quite likely. The methods for
calculating the above sensitivities and calculation of the pension provisions are consistent. The

impact of other actuarial assumptions is insignificant. For this reason, the company has
refrained from making a related presentation.

The revaluation gains in the financial year under review of T€ 98 (previous year: T€ 550) are
offset with the other reserves. The total gains from revaluation of pensions reported under
consolidated equity amount to T€ 3,121 (previous year: T€ 3,024). Deferred taxes recognised
directly in the consolidated equity amounted to T€ 532 (previous year: T€ 519).

### 5. Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows

**(39)** **Consolidated statement of cash flows**

The cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents of the Group
resultant from cash inflows and cash outflows during the reporting year. In accordance with
IAS 7 “Statements of Cash Flows”, the presentation of the cash flow statement is differentiated
according to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. The effects of
currency fluctuation on cash and cash equivalents that are held in foreign currencies or are
due in foreign currencies are presented separately from the cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities.

The funds in the cash flow statement comprise exclusively the cash and cash equivalents as
reported on the balance sheet (see note 29). This includes bank credit balances in the amount
of T€ 1,976 (previous year: T€ 1,797), which the Group may only use for specific purposes
owing to statutory provisions or contractual obligations.

The changes in liabilities from financing activities are subdivided in the following table
according to cash and non-cash components:

The change in liabilities to banks derives from a cash change of T€ 141,887 and a non-cash change of T€ 33,684. The cash change derives from
interest and bank fees paid in the amount of T€ -24,201 and transaction costs paid in the amount of T€ -4,257, as well as net proceeds from
borrowings of T€ 170,346. The non-cash change arises from the deferring of interest and bank fees as well as transaction fees in the amount of
T€ 32,698, additions from company acquisitions in the amount of T€ 1,108 and from a change in foreign currency in the amount of T€ -122.

The changes in liabilities from leases are commented on in note (41).

Only liabilities from the loan in Switzerland are reported under other financial liabilities in this overview. The change in cash collateral deposited
is not shown in this overview as it is not related to financing activities.

### 6. Other disclosures

**(40)** **Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are possible liabilities that could arise from past events, whose existence
will only be confirmed by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events that lie, however,
beyond the Group’s scope of influence. Furthermore, current obligations also represent
contingent liabilities when the related utilisation is not probable and/or the amount of the
obligation cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty. In the course of its ordinary business
activity, the company can become involved in litigation disputes, claims for damages,
investigative and court proceedings, including issues involving product liability and economic
disputes.

In the view of the Management Board and its legal advisers, as of 31 December 2020 no other
significant occurrences existed that could have a material effect on the company’s business,
financial position and financial performance, except for those listed below.

APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A. received a tax assessment notice from the City of Avellino regarding
charges and fees for occupying public land (TOSAP) for a total amount of € 11.5 million for the
2013 to 2017 period (including interest and penalty surcharges). These assessments from 2013
until April 2015 were successfully contested at the first and second instance. The municipality
lodged a related appeal. The appeal against the notices from May 2015 was rejected at second
instance. The company has appealed this decision.

The management currently assumes that the risk of utilisation is unlikely. Moreover, the
possibility exists that the resultant risk can be transferred to the garage’s owner. For this reason,
the provision has not been formed in this set of consolidated financial statements as of 31
December 2020.

**(41)** **Information about leases**

The Group leases parking space, parking buildings, office buildings, plant, machinery and
vehicles, among other assets. Rental agreements are usually concluded for fixed periods of 6
months to 30 years, but may have extension and/or termination options. Such contractual
conditions are utilised in order to ensure maximum operational flexibility for the Group. The
Group’s assessment of whether options are included in the lease liability is set out in note (10).
A change in the assessment of the exercise of options previously considered by the Group to be
not sufficiently certain could significantly increase the lease liability and the corresponding rights
of use. Options whose renewal the Group does not consider to be sufficiently certain as of 31
December 2020 may result in significant future cash outflows. No significant renewal options on
the part of the lessors exist. Rental conditions are negotiated individually and include a large
number of different terms. This includes, in particular, variable payments depending on one
and/or several different factors such as revenue and the frequencies of the respective rental
space. For some leased spaces, up to 100% of the lease payments are contingent on the
revenue generated. Variable payment terms are used for a variety of reasons, including to
minimise the fixed cost base to which the Group is exposed, and to establish a link with the
economic development of the leased area. Depending on the level of the relevant factors, the
Group is exposed to higher or lower expenses from variable lease payments. In the 2020 financial
year, the ratio of fixed lease payments to variable lease expenses was 133% (prior year: 80%),
with the fixed components thereby outweighing the volume-dependent variable lease payments.
Given the expected decrease in the coronavirus epidemic (see notes 43 and 46) and associated
increase in frequency, management expects the ratio to shift significantly in favour of variable
rents in 2021. In the 2019 financial year, prior to the coronavirus pandemic, the expense for
variable leases amounted to € 200,482. The average remaining term of the leases based on the
existing plan is approximately 8 years. In order to optimise leasing costs during the term of the
contract, the Group grants residual value guarantees in some cases, primarily for vehicles and
machinery. As of 31 December 2020, it was assumed that an amount of T€ 59 (previous year:
T€ 235) will have to be paid, which is recognised accordingly in the lease liabilities.


-----

as of 31 December 2020

In the 2020 financial year, financial liabilities from leases amounting to T€ 106,040 (previous
year: T€ 101,179) were repaid and T€ 52,079 (previous year: T€ 50,270) was paid in interest in
connection with leases.

The rights of use under leases are recognised in property, plant and equipment at carrying
amounts of T€ 813,133 (previous year: T€ 855,051), which are analysed by class as follows:

**adjusted**
**2020** **2019**

Further information concerning interest expenses for leases is provided in note (19) Financial
expenses and concerning rights of use in note (22) Property, plant and equipment and rights of
use.

**(42)** **Additional disclosures on financial instruments**

According to IAS 32, financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset at one
entity and a financial liability or equity instrument at another entity. The additional disclosures
required by IFRS are provided in the corresponding sections of the consolidated financial
statements. Please refer, in particular, to the comments under notes (34) and (43).

**(43)** **Group risk management**

The Group’s risk management covers different levels and risk types. At the Group level, risk
management is a significant component of the business planning and controlling processes.
Material risks are monitored and discussed periodically with the Advisory Board. The Group has
established upper limits for certain risks. The tasks of risk identification and risk controlling within
the Group are performed by the Group Treasury function. The Group Treasury reports to the
Management Board on a regular basis and is supported by local risk assistants. Certain
transactions require prior authorisation by the Management Board.

**Financial risk management**
The Group is exposed to various financial risks that arise from the operating business activity
and the financial activities of the Group. The most important financial risks for the Group derive
from changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit standing and solvency of counterparties of
the Group. The periodic reporting of risks is performed by the corresponding controlling functions
within the Group. A stringent and stable financing structure is stipulated for the Group aimed at
compliance with the agreements for external financing concluded within the framework of the
syndicated credit agreement (covenants). Compliance with the covenants is monitored on a
regular basis.


-----

as of 31 December 2020

Derivative financial instruments may only be used for hedging purposes. Depending on the risk
assessment, selective derivative financial instruments and non-derivative hedging instruments
are deployed. Hedging transactions for hedging of the default risk are generally concluded only
with leading financial institutions.

1) Their value is calculated on the basis of quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.

2) Fair value calculation is based on parameters for which directly or indirectly derived quoted prices are available on an active market.

3) Fair value is calculated on the basis of parameters for which no observable market data are available.


-----

as of 31 December 2020

Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other financial assets predominantly have
short remaining terms. For this reason, their carrying amounts approximate fair value on the
reporting date.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other financial assets are short-term. As a
consequence, the respective carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date approximate to
their respective fair values.

The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate to their fair value were
calculated on the basis of the present values of payments connected with the assets and
liabilities, taking into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect
market- and partner-related changes in terms and expectations. This assumes that the margin
agreed for APCOA in this year’s refinancing continues to be in line with the market. This
spread, which is specific to APCOA, was used to adjust the current yield curve for companies
with comparable credit risk. As this adjusted yield curve is not observable on the market, the
fair value of these financial instruments is assigned to Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The fair values of derivative financing instruments are calculated on the basis of valuation
models based on inputs observable on the market.

The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated applying methods discounted
cash flow (DCF) methods.

Derivative financial instruments in hedge relationship - - (1,322) - (1,322)

Derivative financial instruments in hedge relationship - - (1,502) - (1,502)

The fair value of investments categorised at fair value with no effect on income is determined
utilising recognised valuation models with the aid of market multiples.

**Credit risk**
Credit risks arise from the possibility that counterparties to a transaction are not in a position
to fulfil their obligations, and that this will lead to financial loss for the Group. The maximum
credit risk, without consideration of any additional collateral or other credit enhancements,
corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets of the Group. The Group accounts
for the credit risk by forming corresponding value adjustments.

Trade receivables: For historical reasons, the company does not see any high risks of bad debt
losses. Any and all doubtful accounts receivable are value-adjusted. Uncollectible receivables
are written off in full. Trade receivables are subjected to active risk management with a focus
on the monitoring of current receivables. Reference is also made to the remarks in note (28)
Trade receivables and other financial assets. Receivables management has the goal of
improving the Group’s liquidity through the optimised use of assets while at the same time
maintaining an acceptable risk level. The danger of risk concentration is viewed as low within
the Group since the majority of trade receivables are due from long-term tenants. These
receivables are characterised by broad-based geographic distribution and a large number of
different debtors. The risks are monitored according to country and type of counterparty on a
regular basis. No risk concentration per country exists within the Group.

Receivables due from customers in an amount of T€ 2,422 (previous year: T€ 2,689) are
covered by collateral (mainly deposits).

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risks arise when financial obligations exceed financial assets at any point in time.
The Group manages liquidity risks by maintaining an adequate, readily available reserve for
ensuring the required level of liquidity at all times. The Group’s liquidity is monitored on an
ongoing basis. An additional T€ 33,997 can be drawn from the revolving credit facility as
required. A further line of the Guarantee Facility in an amount of T€ 10,569 can be utilised for


-----

as of 31 December 2020

bill guarantees. In the 2019 financial year, the Group had free lines of T€ 33,997 available
from the Revolving Credit Facility and T€ 31,729 from the Guarantee Facility. For further
details, please see note (34) Financial liabilities.

APCOA PARKING Group’s liquidity risk has increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic arising
from March 2020 and its impact on revenue. The management has taken additional measures
to ensure sufficient liquidity within the Group. These include reductions in rental payments
through contract renegotiations, changes in fixed to variable rental components, operating
expense and overhead reductions, investment reductions, and the use of government
measures such as short-time working allowances. On 30 March 2020, the Swiss companies
APCOA Parking Switzerland AG and APCOA Parking Service Switzerland AG took out
government-guaranteed loans totalling TCHF 800 with a term of five years. The owner made
a cash capital contribution of T€ 40,000 to the capital reserve on 27 May 2020, and a further
financing facility (Facility B2) of T€ 78,000 (T€ 68,000 on 27 May 2020 and T€ 10,000 on 18
June 2020) was drawn down by the company. This bullet facility has the same seniority and
maturity as the existing bullet facility of T€ 514,000 (Term Loan Facility B). The interest rate
on this new facility is 7.25% p.a., while the interest rate on Term Loan B is currently 3.75%.

**Going concern**

At the end of 2020, the Group’s debt financing was mainly provided by a syndicated loan.
These include bullet loans of T€ 592,000 (Facility B, Facility B2) with a term until March 2024,
a guarantee facility of T€ 30,000 (Guarantee Facility) with a term until March 2023 and a
revolving credit facility of T€ 35.000 (Revolving Credit Facility) with a term until March 2023.
As of 31 December 2020, the guarantee line had been drawn in the amount of T€ 19,431,
and the revolving credit facility in the amount of T€ 1,003.

The liquidity ratios currently required under the syndicated loan were met by the Group.

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020, APCOA Parking Group has been
significantly impacted in economic terms. In order to reflect the ongoing impact of Covid-19
on operations for 2021, the management adjusted the budget planning at the beginning of
the 2021 financial year to reflect the new conditions based on a so-called “worst case”
scenario. This worst case scenario serves as the starting point for the analyses in the going
concern review, and is applied as a “stress test”. On the basis of available data (e.g. in relation
to the vaccination programs), the management considers a renewed wave of infections of the
assumed magnitude from the third quarter onwards to be unlikely. In the worst case scenario,
management initially plans a gradual easing of the lockdown measures due to the successive
increase in vaccination rates throughout Europe, and an accompanying recovery in the
revenue trend. Possible further lockdown measures in the wake of a resurgence in Covid-19
infection numbers after the summer months of 2021 (beginning in the fall of 2021) have been
considered in “worst case” planning by the management for the period from October 2021
through to March 2022. The “Airport” and “Trade Fairs and Events” segments are particularly
volatile. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, the management expects a greater level of
reductions in revenue to occur again in the worst case scenario due to a possible further
Covid-19 infection wave, especially for the “Airport” and “Trade Fairs and Events” segments.
In the Management Board’s opinion, the package of measures described under liquidity risk
is sufficient to secure the company as a going concern and is also sufficient to safeguard
against further negative developments from the Covid-19 pandemic. Solvency and
compliance with the amended credit terms, and thereby a positive going concern outlook, are
secured according to the management’s expectation. For this reason, the financial statements
have been prepared under the going concern assumption. However, the further course of the
pandemic cannot be assessed definitively.

**Market risks**

A market risk arises from changes in the market prices of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities. A market risk can affect the operating result, financial result and equity of the Group.
With respect to the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses showing
the effects of hypothetical changes in the relevant risk variables on income and equity. In
addition to currency risks, the Group is also subject to an interest rate risk. The periodic effects
are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in the risk variables to the portfolio of
financial instruments at the balance sheet date. It is assumed that the portfolio at the balance
sheet date is representative for the year as a whole.

**Currency risk**

The Group is active across Europe and is consequently exposed to currency fluctuation risks
that may affect the financial results and equity of the Group. A currency risk arises when
amounts paid or received for transactions in local currencies fluctuate as a consequence of
changes in the currency exchange rates (transaction risk). In addition, currency risk may arise
through the translation into euros of consolidated subsidiaries’ financial statements whose
functional currency is not the euro, when preparing consolidated financial statements
(translation risk). The Group’s objectives in managing foreign currency risks are to maintain
the economic value of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s
financial results. Foreign currency risks pursuant to IFRS 7 arise from financial instruments
that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and are monetary in
nature; exchange-rate-based differences resultant from the translation of financial statements
into the Group currency are not taken into consideration. In general, all non-functional
currencies in which the Group maintains financial instruments are considered as relevant risk
variables.

The currency sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:

Significant original monetary financial instruments (liquid assets, receivables, liabilities from
leases and non-interest-bearing liabilities) are denominated directly in the functional currency,
with a few exceptions. Exchange rate fluctuations do not have any material effect on the
results or equity of the Group at this time. Non-interest-bearing securities and equity
instruments held are not monetary and are consequently not associated with any currency
risk pursuant to IFRS 7.

Interest income and interest expenses arising from financial instruments are recognised
directly in the functional currency for the most part. In the 2020 and 2019 financial years, the
currency sensitivity analysis showed no effects from liabilities to banks, as the newly arranged
syndicated lending agreement is denominated exclusively in euros.

Interest-bearing liabilities not denominated in the functional currency also related to
receivables and liabilities to Group companies denominated in euros, pounds sterling,
Norwegian kroner, Swedish kroner, Danish kroner, Polish zloty and Swiss francs. The
sensitivity analysis is shown in the following table.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risks arise from changes in interest rates, which can impact negatively on the
financial result and equity of the Group. Interest rate fluctuations can lead to changes in
interest income and interest expense. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain
financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The main objective in managing interest
rate risks within the Group is to keep the net interest result stable. The interest rate and foreign
currency development is monitored at weekly intervals and reported to the Management
Board and the shareholders. Further hedging measures are taken when and if required.

Interest rate risks are presented by means of sensitivity analyses as required by IFRS 7,
which present the effects of changes in the market interest rates on interest payments,
interest income and interest expenses, other components of income and possibly the effects
on equity. Sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:

  - Changes in the market interest rate of original financial instruments carrying fixed
interest rates only affect the result if they are measured at fair value. Accordingly, all
fixed-interest financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost are not
associated with any interest risks pursuant to IFRS 7.

  - Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that are deployed as
hedging instruments as part of a cash flow hedge for hedging interest-based payment
fluctuations have effects on the hedging reserve under equity and are consequently
taken into consideration in the equity capital-based sensitivity calculations.

  - Changes in the market interest rate affect the interest result from original variableinterest bearing financial instruments, whose interest payments are not designated as
underlying transactions in the framework of cash flow hedges against interest risks
and are consequently included in the calculation of earnings-based sensitivity factors.

If the level of market interest rates had been higher by 100 basis points in the 2020 financial
year, other comprehensive income would have been lower by T€ 238 (previous year: T€ 334)
and the result for the year would have been lower by T€ 2,576 (previous year: T€ 2,308). Had
the level of market interest rates been lower by 100 basis points, other comprehensive income
would have been higher by T€ 260 (previous year: T€ 368) and the result for the year would
have been higher by T€ 0 (previous year: T€ 0).

**Hedging measures – cash flow hedges**

In the financial year under review, the Group had two DKK interest rate swaps (amortising;
previous year: 2) to hedge variable interest from lease liabilities. A variable-interest financial
lease liability was designated as the hedged item for the amortising swaps denominated in
DKK. Changes in the cash flow from the hedged items arising from the change in the 3-month
CIBOR rate are compensated for (on a quarterly basis) by the cash flow changes in the
interest rate swaps. The hedging measure is aimed at transforming a part of the variableinterest lease liabilities into fixed-interest lease liabilities and consequently to hedge the cash
flow from the financial liabilities. The amortising interest rate swaps denominated in DKK with


-----

as of 31 December 2020

a nominal value of T€ 4,527 (previous year: T€ 5,288) have a residual term until June 2032.

The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is assessed prospectively using the critical
terms match method. As all input parameters that determine the value match, the hedging
relationship is effective. Reasons for ineffectiveness may derive from a different credit risk
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. A regular check is performed to ensure
that credit risk does not dominate in the case of hedged items and hedges. Retrospectively,
a possible ineffectiveness is measured applying the dollar offset method.


**Interest hedge**


**Average net**


**Fixed interest rate of**


**investment** **hedge instrument**

**Maturity** **T€**
Due within one year 3,678 6.2%
Due between one and five years 2,765 6.2%
Due after five years 1,212 6.2%

As of the balance sheet date all hedge relationships of this type were considered as highly
effective. The fair value of interest-rate derivatives deployed as hedging instruments
amounted to T€ -1,322 within the Group as of 31 December 2020 (previously: T€ -1,502).
The fair value is reported under non-current financial liabilities. In the 2020 financial year, the
realisation with neutral effect on profit/loss led to a value change of the hedging transactions
in the amount of T€ +180 (previous year: T€ +51). Under Danish tax law, the negative market
value of the DKK swaps is tax deductible. Due to this, no deferred taxes are to be recognised
in connection with the DKK interest rate swaps, and the recognition in equity is at the net
value. The change in value from the underlying transaction amounted to T€ -180.

In connection with the DKK interest rate swaps, other comprehensive income is reduced by
T€ 124 in 2020 (previous year: T€ 296) and a reclassification of T€ 269 (previous year:   T€
347) was made to net interest income, resulting in a change in equity of T€ 145 (previous
year: T€ 39). No ineffectiveness arose in the reporting period.

**Capital management**

The Group defines its managed capital as the consolidated equity including minority
interests. The goals of capital management include:

  - the possibility to secure the Group’s continuation as a going concern with a view to
being able to continue offering top quality parking space management to customers,
and earnings to investors.

  - to be able to offer investors appropriate income based on the risks that are entered
into.

  - having the financial resources that enable the Group to invest in areas that will generate
further earnings for investors.

APCOA PARKING Group’s capital management strategy aims to ensure that the Group
companies have an equity base that meets local requirements. Furthermore, financial
covenants have been agreed for the Group in the syndicated loan agreement, which are
calculated on the basis of the consolidated figures of APCOA PARKING Group without taking
into account the effects of IFRS 16. For this purpose, the available liquidity of APCOA
PARKING Group is calculated, including both cash and cash equivalent investments
(excluding restricted bank balances) and available unused credit line. This available liquidity
may not be less than T€ 10,000. The management of APCOA PARKING Group and the
syndicate banks regularly review compliance with these covenants. In the 2020 financial year,
all externally imposed capital requirements were met.

APCOA continues to be heavily affected by pandemic coronavirus containment measures in early
2021, particularly in areas such as airports, trade shows and events. The further course of the
spread of the coronavirus and the consequences for the Group's business performance are being
monitored on an ongoing basis. Based on recent developments (continuation of mobility restrictions
in the first quarter of 2021), the Management Board expects that the spread of coronavirus and the
necessary containment measures and associated reductions in frequencies will have a significant
negative impact on the Group's business compared to the pre-coronavirus period and on its
financial position and performance in 2021. For further information, please see note (10) Accounting
and measurement principles, note (43) Group risk management, as well as the Group management
report.

No further events of particular significance occurred after the end of the financial year under review.

The consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2020 were approved by the Management
Board on 26 March 2021.

The Shareholders' General Meeting will approve the consolidated financial statements. In the event
of significant errors, the consolidated financial statements can be revised after completion.

The following auditor‘s report (Bestätigungsvermerk des unabhängigen Abschlussprüfers) has been
issued in accordance with Section 322 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch) on the
consolidated financial statements and group management report (Konzernlagebericht) of APCOA
Parking Holdings GmbH as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. The group
management report is neither included nor incorporated by reference in this Offering
Memorandum.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT**

To APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, Leinfelden-Echterdingen

##### Audit Opinions

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH,

Leinfelden-Echterdingen, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated

statement of financial position as at 31 December 2019, and the consolidated statement of

comprehensive income, consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of

changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January to

31 December 2019, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of

significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the group management report of

APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019.

In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit,

- the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the
IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant
to § [Article] 315e Abs. [paragraph] 1 HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial  Code] and,
in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and
financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial performance for the
financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019, and

- the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the
Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the
consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately
presents the opportunities and risks of future development.

Pursuant to § 322 Abs. 3 Satz [sentence] 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any

reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group

management report.

##### Basis for the Audit Opinions

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management

report in accordance with § 317 HGB in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards

for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Pub
lic Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are

further described in the “Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial

Statements and of the Group Management Report” section of our auditor’s report. We are

F-94


-----

independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of German commercial and

professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in

accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is

sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial

statements and on the group management report.

##### Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern

We draw attention to the disclosures in section “(43) Group risk management” of the notes to the

consolidated financial statements as well as the disclosures in section “3 Forecast” and section “4

Report on opportunities and risks” of the group management report, where the executive directors

describe that the Group is in a tense liquidity situation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the

Group’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on that there will not be another

economic standstill or, respectively, on a successful continuation of business after the end of the

most significant negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the financial support from

share- holders or external third parties will be continued. As stated in section “(43) Group risk

management”, section “3 Forecast” and section “4 Report on opportunities and risks”, these

events and conditions indicate along with the other matters stated there that a material uncertainty

exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and that

represents a risk that the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is threatened

pursuant to § 322 Abs. 2 Satz 3 HGB. Our audit opinions are not modified in respect of this

matter.

_Responsibilities of the Executive Directors for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the_
##### Group Management Report

The executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements

that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional

requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB and that the consolidated

financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets,

liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive

directors are responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the

preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether

due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive directors are responsible for

assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for

dis- closing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for

financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to

liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.

Furthermore, the executive directors are responsible for the preparation of the group management

report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material

F-95


-----

respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal

requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition,

the executive directors are responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have

considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with

the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for

the assertions in the group management report.

_Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group_
##### Management Report

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial

statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and

whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s

position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and

the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and

appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an

auditor’s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on

the group management report.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in

accordance with § 317 HGB and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for

Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always

detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered

material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the

economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this

group management report.

We exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We

also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements
and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate
to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial
statements and of arrangements and measures (systems) relevant to the audit of the group
management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of
these systems.

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive directors and the
reasonableness of estimates made by the executive directors and related disclosures.

F-96


-----

- Conclude on the appropriateness of the executive directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required
to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are
inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit
evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.

- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial
statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial
performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional
requirements of German commercial law pursuant to § 315e Abs. 1 HGB.

- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities
or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial
statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction,
supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit
opinions.

- Evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial
statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides.

- Perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive directors
in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we
evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive directors as a basis for
the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information
from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective
information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk
that future events will differ materially from the prospective information.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the

planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant

deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

### APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH Leinfelden-Echterdingen

 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the 2019 financial year

 1. General

APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH, with its registered head office in Leinfelden-Echterdingen,
Germany, is a limited liability company under German law. As the parent company of the Group
(the APCOA PARKING Group), it is registered at the Stuttgart District Court under commercial
register sheet number 726108. The company’s administrative head office is located at
Flughafenstrasse 34, 70629 Stuttgart, Germany. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in euros (€), since the majority of Group transactions are processed in that currency.
Unless otherwise specified, the presentation is in thousands of euros (T€). The use of rounded
amounts and percentages may result in differences due to commercial rounding. The
consolidated income statement is prepared in accordance with the nature of expense format.
The financial year of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH and its subsidiaries included in the
consolidated financial statements corresponds to the calendar year.

The consolidated financial statements of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH are published in the
electronic version of the German Federal Gazette (Bundesanzeiger).

**(1)** **Business activity**

The Group operates in the parking facilities management area. The Group has a diversified
portfolio of rental/lease agreements and management agreements for the management of
parking spaces/facilities and parking garages.

**(2)** **Ownership structure**

The company is wholly owned by Park Luxco 3 S.C.A., with its registered head office in
Luxembourg, Luxembourg. Park Luxco S.C.A., with its registered head office in Luxembourg,
Luxembourg, is the ultimate parent company and indirect shareholder in APCOA Parking
Holdings GmbH.

**Management coinvestment program**

As the parent company of the APCOA PARKING Group, Park Luxco 3 S.C.A., a company
under Luxembourg law that holds 100% of the shares in APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH,
persons of the APCOA PARKING Group together with further external individuals (together
referred to as the coinvestors) hold an indirect 12.50% interest via coinvestment company,
Park Investment S.C.S.p. As of the balance sheet date, this group of individuals held 100% of
the shares available for this purpose. The shares were offered to the coinvestors in 2016 and
2017 at the respective current fair values. The fair value was calculated by an external valuer
based on recognised valuation methods, including applying peer group earnings multiples. The
coinvestment program plans for the coinvestors to participate in a change of ownership of the
parent company, including due to a disposal or an IPO, in the resultant net proceeds in
accordance with their indirect interests. The coinvestment program includes regulations for the
instance that the group of individuals leave the company early. Depending on the reason and
timing of the departure from the company, coinvestors in this instance are entitled to buy back
their investment at a value between the original purchase cost and the fair value on the date
of leaving the company, if a minimum employment period of three years has been reached.
Repurchase in this context is structured in the form of mutual call and put options, depending
on the reason and timing of the departure from the company.
As the shares were acquired by the coinvestors at the respective current fair values on the
purchase date, no emolument to be recognised as personnel expenses in the period existed,
or exists.


-----

December 2019

**(3)** **Basis for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the European Union (EU) as of 31
December 2019, and with the supplementary provisions under section 315e of the German
Commercial Code (HGB). “IFRS” encompasses all standards published by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as well as the interpretations of the International Financial
Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRIC).

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements is based on the assumption that the
company will continue as a going-concern, which implies that the group is able to meet the
mandatory repayment terms of the leasing and loan liabilities as stated in note (34) Financial
liabilities. APCOA is severely affected by the occurrence of the Corona Virus (SARS - CoV-2)
in its markets increasingly starting in February and March 2020, and the enacted global
measures such as travel restrictions, exit restrictions, cancellation of events and closure of
public facilities (see also Chapter (46) Events after the balance sheet date and the explanations
in the group management report). APCOA has taken a variety of measures to mitigate the
effects (see section (43) Group risk management). As a result, management expects the Group
to have adequate resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future.

Reporting for financial year 2019 is based on the applicable mandatory standards and provides
a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position and performance. The Group has not made
early, voluntary application of standards and IFRIC interpretations that have already been
issued but had not yet entered into force. The company will apply these standards and
interpretations for the first time as of the mandatory date.

**New or amended standards and interpretations adopted by the EU and applicable for**
**the first time during the financial year under review**

The amendments to IFRS 9 “Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation” were
published by the IASB in October 2017 and adopted by the EU in March 2018. The
amendments to IFRS 9 are generally to be applied retrospectively to financial years beginning
on or after 1 January 2019. As no cases of application exist at present within the APCOA
PARKING Group, the first-time application of these amendments did not have any effect on
the financial position and performance.

The amendments to IAS 19 entitled “Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement” clarify that
the current service cost and net interest from the date of the plan amendment, curtailment or
settlement must be determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions at the time of the plan
adjustment. The amendments to IAS 19 are to be applied prospectively for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2019. As APCOA PARKING Group did not implement any plan
amendments, curtailments or settlements during the reporting period, the amendments had no
effect on the consolidated financial statements.

The amendments to IAS 28 concerning the accounting for long-term investments clarify that
IFRS 9, including the regulations on impairment, is to be applied to long-term investments in
associates and joint ventures that form part of the net investment but that are not equity
accounted. The amendments to IAS 28 are generally to be applied retrospectively to financial
years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. As there are currently no cases of application in
the APCOA PARKING Group, the first-time application of these amendments did not have any
effect on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows.

As part of the annual improvements to the IFRS standards cycle 2015-2017, the IASB has
made selective amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23. The first-time application
of these amendments had no effect on the APCOA PARKING Group’s financial position and
performance.

The interpretation IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments” provides guidance on
the accounting for tax liabilities and tax assets under IAS 12 where uncertainties exist in


-----

December 2019

relation to the recognition of income tax treatment by tax authorities. IFRIC 23 is to be applied
for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The first-time application of the
interpretation had no effect on the APCOA PARKING Group’s financial position and
performance.

The APCOA PARKING Group applied IFRS 16 for the first time for the financial year
commencing 1 January 2019 and applied the transition regulations of the modified
retrospective method. Accordingly, the previous year’s figures have not been adjusted. The
transition effects as of 1 January 2019 are reported cumulatively in revenue reserves.

As part of the transition to IFRS 16, right-of-use assets in the amount of € 907.5 million and
lease liabilities in the amount of € 928.8 million were recognised as of 1 January 2019. Effects
in the amount of € 1.3 million were recognised in the revenue reserves, further € 0.4 million
were recognized in equity attributable to minority shares.

Based on the operating lease commitments as of 31 December 2018, the following
reconciliation to the opening balance sheet value of the lease obligations arose:

**T€**

operate lease commitments disclosed as at 31.12.2018 1,229,290

Revaluation of the contract term for additional reasonably certain renewal options 4,126

less short-term leases not recognized as liability (7,334)

Add/less others (low value assets, indexation, residual value guarantee) 431
**Gross lease liabilities as of 01.01.2019** **1,226,513**

Weighted average incremental borrowing rate 5.6%
**Lease liabilities discounted using the incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019** **902,244**

add present value of finance lease liabilities as of 31.12.2018 26,579
**Lease liabilities recognized as of 01.01.2019** **928,823**

Current lease liabilities 174,722
Non-current lease liabilities 754,101

The APCOA PARKING Group makes use of the option to exclude intangible assets from the
scope of IFRS 16 and to treat individual leases ending in 2019 in accordance with the
exemption regulations for short-term leases. This rule is also applied to current (short-term)
leases commencing after 31 December 2018. The simplification for low-value leases is also
used. At the initial adoption date, no reassessment is made as to whether a contract constitutes
or contains a lease. The previous assessment of whether a lease is onerous was adopted in
the first-time application by adjusting the right-of-use asset by the provisions for onerous
contracts arising from the lease existing as of 31 December 2018. Reversals and reductions
in the value of leases with assumed earlier assessments are recognised in profit or loss. Lease
terms with renewal or termination options were determined retrospectively. When recognizing
right-of-use assets, the right to choose according to IFRS 16.C8(b) was used differently for the
individual contracts.

The first-time application of the other standards and interpretations did not lead to any material
modifications.

**New or amended standards and interpretations either not yet adopted by the EU or not**
**yet applied**

In September 2019, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 in relation
to the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for
the first time on 1 January 2020. As the amendments introduce temporary relief for the
continuation of previous hedge accounting, no effects are likely for the APCOA PARKING
Group.


-----

December 2019

In October 2018, the IASB published amendments to IFRS 3 regarding the definition of a
business. The amendments are intended to assist companies in determining whether a
transaction is to be accounted for as a business combination or as an acquisition of assets. To
this end, the minimum requirements for a business are clarified, and guidelines are provided
to assist in assessing whether an acquired business process is substantial. The amendments
to IFRS 3 also introduce an optional test for a concentration of fair value in an asset or group
of similar assets. As the amendments are to be applied prospectively to transactions occurring
on or after 1 January 2020, no effects for APCOA PARKING Group will arise on the transition
date.

In January 2020, the IASB published amendments to IAS 1 on the classification of liabilities as
current or non-current. In particular, the amendments to IAS 1 clarify that the classification of
liabilities as current or non-current is to be based on the entity’s existing rights as of the balance
sheet date. In this context, management’s expectations and intentions as to whether such a
right will actually be exercised or early repayment is intended should not be taken into
consideration. The amendments to IAS 1 are to be applied retrospectively and for financial
years beginning on or after 1 January 2022. At present, the APCOA PARKING Group does
not expect the first-time application of the amendments to IAS 1 to have any effect on the
consolidated financial statements.

In addition to the amendments described in detail above, the IASB has issued further
pronouncements, the application of which is also not yet mandatory at the present time and
whose applicability in some cases still requires adoption into EU law. The APCOA PARKING
Group does not currently expect the application of these pronouncements to have a material
effect on its financial position and performance.

The APCOA PARKING Group does not currently plan to make voluntary, early application of
IASB pronouncements that the EU has recognised, but which do not yet require mandatory
application until later financial years.

**(4)** **Consolidated Group**

These consolidated financial statements include APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH and 34
companies (previous year: 31) which were fully consolidated as of 31 December 2019.

**Investments in equity accounted companies**

Investments in equity accounted companies comprise associated companies and joint
ventures. As a matter of principle, companies over which the company exerts a significant
influence or which are joint ventures are equity accounted in the company’s consolidated
financial statements. On 4 January 2019, the company and a partner founded the joint venture
ParcBrux BVBA based in Gent, Belgium with a registered capital of T€ 200, of which 50 percent
(T€ 100) is attributable to APCOA.

On 4 October 2017, the company acquired a 13.33% interest in AGILE PARKING SOLUTIONS
PRIVATE LIMITED, New Delhi, India. The company is entitled to one seat on this company’s
supervisory Board and hereby has a significant influence on this associated company.

**(5)** **Other holdings**

Other investments in which the company holds less than 20 percent are carried at fair value
with no effect on income.

**(6)** **Acquisitions**

In 2019, APCOA made the following strategic acquisitions as part of the Group strategy:

a) OnePark A/S

APCOA PARKING A/S acquired 100 percent of the shares in OnePark A/S with effect from 6
May 2019, in order to strengthen its presence in Denmark and to accelerate growth. Since its
foundation in 2012, OnePark A/S has been operating parking management with currently more
than 30,000 managed parking spaces in Denmark. The company was fully consolidated in the
APCOA PARKING Group on the acquisition date.

Since its initial consolidation on 6 May 2019, OnePark has contributed T€ 11,091 to
consolidated sales revenue and T€ 2,692 to consolidated net profit. If the acquisition had taken
place on 1 January 2019, OnePark would have contributed T€ 16,258 to sales revenue, and
T€ 3,520 to consolidated net profit.

The transaction costs for the acquisition of OnePark, which were recognised in other expenses
for the 2019 financial year, amounted to T€ 471.

The transaction is classified as an acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. The purchase price
amounted to T€ 28,521 (TDKK 212,900) in cash. Goodwill arising on the acquisition amounted
to T€ 28,301 (TDKK 211,253) and consists primarily of components not separately identifiable,
such as positive business prospects, synergies with existing operations in Denmark, and
employee expertise.

b) NCPS Group

With effect from 8 August 2019, APCOA Ireland Ltd. acquired all shares directly and indirectly
in Nationwide Controlled Parking Systems Limited (NCPS), in Mobile Research Solution
Limited (MRS) and in Parking and Enforcement Agency Ltd. (PEA). The aim is to strengthen

the presence in Ireland and Northern Ireland and to accelerate growth. NCPS has been
operating car park management since its inception in 1998 and currently has over 100,000
managed parking spaces in Ireland and Northern Ireland. The company was fully consolidated
in the APCOA PARKING Group on the acquisition date.

Since its initial consolidation as of 8 August 2019, NCPS has contributed T€ 4,397 to
consolidated sales revenue and T€ 859 to consolidated net profit. If the acquisition had
occurred on 1 January 2019, NCPS would have contributed T€ 10,552 to sales revenue and
T€ 2,060 to consolidated net profit.

The transaction costs for the acquisition of NCPS recognised in other expenses for the 2019
financial year amounted to T€ 992.

The transaction is classified as an acquisition in accordance with IFRS 3. The acquisition price
amounted to T€ 11,350 in both cash and contingent consideration. The contingent
consideration depends on the outcome of a VAT case as well as the future growth of business
activities; the amount of the contingent liability is limited to a maximum of € 2.8 million. It
remains the case that the management of APCOA PARKING does not expect that contingent
consideration will fall due, with the fair value consequently amounting to zero.

The goodwill arising from the acquisition amounted to T€ 3,584 and consists mainly of
components that cannot be separately identified, such as positive business prospects,
synergies with existing operations in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and employee expertise.

c) ALPINA DEUTSCHLAND GmbH

APCOA Parking Deutschland GmbH acquired 100 percent of the shares in ALPINA
DEUTSCHLAND GmbH (Alpina) with effect from 2 December 2019 with the aim of augmenting
its presence in Germany. Alpina has been managing parking spaces in the greater Munich
region since its foundation in 2017. The company was fully consolidated in the APCOA
PARKING Group on the acquisition date.

If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2019, Alpina would have contributed T€ 265 to
sales revenue and a loss of T€ 26 to consolidated net profit.

### 2. Accounting and measurement methods

**(7) Consolidation principles**

The consolidated financial statements include APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH and the
subsidiaries over which it exercises direct or indirect control. The APCOA PARKING Group
controls an investee if it has power over the investee. In other words, the APCOA PARKING
Group has existing rights giving it the current ability to direct the relevant activities. These are
activities that significantly influence returns from the investee. The APCOA PARKING Group
must also have exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
and the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the level of such returns.

Where the APCOA PARKING Group holds less than the majority of voting rights, other facts
and circumstances may mean that the APCOA PARKING Group controls an investee
(including contractual arrangements which give the APCOA PARKING Group power over the
investee). The APCOA PARKING Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts
and circumstances indicate that changes have occurred to the factors determining control.

Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date when the APCOA PARKING Group acquires
control, and deconsolidated from the date when the APCOA PARKING Group loses control.
All assets, liabilities, income, expenditure and cash flows of APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH
are combined with those of its subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.

Intragroup transactions (revenues, expenses and income as well as receivables and liabilities)
are fully eliminated.

Any difference that arises from the acquisition of further shares or the sale of shares after the
initial consolidation without any loss of control over an already fully consolidated subsidiary is
taken directly to equity.


-----

December 2019

**Corporate acquisitions**

A business combination is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 10 “Consolidated Financial
Statements” applying the purchase method in accordance with IFRS 3 “Business
Combinations”. The acquired assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value at the time
of acquisition. This entails offsetting the costs to acquire the participating interests with the fair
values of the acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Any excess over the
acquisition cost is recognised as goodwill and impairment tested at least once a year. Where
the acquisition cost is lower than the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities, the
difference is immediately recognised in profit or loss. If less than 100% of shares are acquired,
the acquisition costs of an investment are compared against the fair values of the assets and
liabilities acquired on a pro rata basis. Minority interests are reported in equity in the amount
of the residual fair value, including the profits and losses attributable to them.

Applying the acquisition method requires estimates and assessments to be made, in particular
in determining the fair value of the intangible assets and of the property, plant and equipment
acquired, and the liabilities assumed, upon acquisition, as well as the useful lives of the
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment acquired. The estimates made as part of
allocating the purchase price may significantly influence the Group’s future results.

**(8)** **Currency translation**

Business transactions recorded in the individual financial statements of entities that process
their business transactions in currencies other than the respective local currencies are
translated at the exchange rate applicable as of the transaction date. Monetary items
denominated in foreign currencies (liquid assets, receivables, liabilities) are translated at the
closing rate applicable at the respective balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are recorded at fair value are translated at the
exchange rates valid as of the date when the fair value is determined. Gains and losses arising
from currency translation are recognised in profit or loss.

The Group includes 19 (previous year: 18) subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
euro. With the exception of one company (APCOA Parking Holdings UK Ltd., Uxbridge), the
subsidiaries’ functional currency corresponds to the respective local currency, as the
subsidiaries are economically independent foreign sub-entities. For the purposes of the
consolidated financial statements, financial statements prepared in foreign currencies are
translated into euros. The financial statements are translated on the basis of the functional
currency concept in accordance with IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange
Rates” applying the modified closing rate method. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities are
translated at the closing rate, equity at the historical rate, and expenses and income at the
average exchange rate for the year. Any differences arising from currency translation are
posted to the Group’s other reserves (reserve for currency differences). When a subsidiary is
disposed of, these translation differences are recognised in profit or loss.

Currency translation in the Group is based on the following exchange rates against the euro:

**Closing rate** **Average rate** **Closing rate** **Average rate**
**Currency** **ISO Code** **2019** **2019** **2018** **2018**
British pound GBP 0.850800 0.877307 0.894530 0.884747

**(9)** **Use of management estimates and judgement**

As part of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Management Board must make
estimates and assumptions that can impact on components and items in the consolidated
financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Actual
developments may vary from the estimates and assumptions made.

**Trade receivables**

All trade receivables are initially recognised at the transaction price and subsequently adjusted
for impairment to reflect the expected credit loss. The calculation is based on historical credit
loss, which are adjusted to reflect current economic developments. As a rule, a decline in the
volume of receivables reduces such value adjustments on a portfolio basis accordingly, and
vice versa. If individual receivables are at risk of default, estimates and assessments based on
the respective customer’s creditworthiness are included.

**Impairment**

The determination of the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit, an asset and of an
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is based on management estimates. The
recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. The
company normally determines these values in line with valuation methods based on discounted
cash flows. These discounted cash flows are calculated on the basis of five-year forecasts
which are prepared in line with financial plans authorised by the Management Board. The cash
flow forecasts take into consideration historical data and are based on the Management
Board’s best estimates of future development. Cash flows beyond the planning period are
extrapolated applying a standard growth rate that is determined in consideration of the
expected long-term development potential of the relevant markets and publicly available longterm inflation expectations as well as the possibility of passing these on to customers in the
form of price increases. Weighted average costs of capital are utilised to discount the cash
flows. These are based on a peer group and were determined using capital market data. The
most important assumptions on which the determination of fair value less costs to sell and
value in use is based include estimated cash flows, estimated growth rates, weighted average
costs of capital, and tax rates. The measurement of intangible assets with indeterminable
useful lives is additionally dependent on the underlying licence rates. These premises and their
underlying methodology can have a significant impact on the respective values and ultimately
on the amount of possible impairment of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives,
and other assets. Further details on estimates and assumptions are provided in note 10
“Accounting and measurement methods” under the heading “Impairment of long-lived assets”
and note 21 “Intangible assets”.

**Pensions and similar obligations**

Obligations for pensions and similar commitments and related expenses and income are
calculated in accordance with actuarial valuations. Such valuations are based on key
assumptions, including discounting factors, wage and pension trends, and life expectancies.
The discount factor applied reflects the interest rates that can be achieved as of the balance
sheet date for high-value fixed-interest investments with matching maturities. The underlying
assumptions can differ from actual outcomes due to a fluctuating market and economic
situation. This can exert significant effects on the obligations of pensions and other postretirement benefits. The resultant differences are recognised directly in other comprehensive
income under equity in the period in which they arise, and do not affect profit and loss as a
consequence.

**Other provisions**

The calculation of provisions is associated with significant estimates. The other provisions are
formed for a large number of individual risks whose payment dates or amounts are uncertain.


-----

December 2019

Determining these other provisions requires the making of estimates. These provisions also
relate to provisions against risks arising from legal disputes and processes, insofar as these
fulfil the criteria for making provisions. Assessing the level of such provisions entails not only
an assessment of circumstances in the specific case that is being asserted, but also making
recourse to the results of comparable proceedings and appraisals by lawyers and other factors,
as well as assumptions about event probabilities and the bandwidths of potential utilisation.

**Income tax**

The recognition of tax provisions is based on estimates. It should also be determined whether
the recognition of deferred tax assets is permitted, or whether a valuation adjustment to
deferred tax assets is required. The likelihood that deferred tax assets arising from timing
differences and losses carried forward can be offset against taxable profits in the future must
be evaluated. Deferred tax assets must also be recognised to the extent that sufficient taxable
temporary differences are available. Uncertainties exist concerning the interpretation of
complex tax regulations as well as concerning the amount and date of future taxable income.

**Leasing**

The measurement of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets requires assumptions to be made
regarding key parameters or their probabilities and dates of occurrence or exercise, as well as
the determination of an appropriate interest rate. All facts and circumstances are taken into
consideration when determining the term of leases that provide an economic incentive to
exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options. Term modifications arising
from the exercise of extension or termination options are only included in the term of the lease
if their exercise is reasonably certain. For the APCOA PARKING Group this is regularly the
case if the exercise option lies within the detailed planning period and has been considered in
the budget.

For further information, please refer to section (10) Accounting and valuation policies (41)
Information about leases.

**(10)** **Accounting and measurement principles**

The significant accounting and measurement principles applied in the preparation of the
consolidated financial statements are presented below. Further explanations of individual
consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet items, as well as the
corresponding figures, are provided in the notes.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets with a specified useful life are measured at acquisition cost and amortised
straight-line over their useful life, as a matter of principle. Intangible assets with an indefinite
useful life are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets are also reviewed for
impairment whenever indications exist of impairment, and are written down to their recoverable
amount where necessary. If the factors causing a previously recognised impairment no longer
apply, the asset is reinstated at the value it would have had if no impairment had been
recognised in prior periods.

Useful lives and amortisation methods for intangible assets are reviewed at every reporting
date at the least. Where expectations are no longer in line with previous estimates, the
corresponding changes are recognised as changes in accounting estimates in accordance with
IAS 8.

The intangible assets item includes goodwill, licences, right-of-use assets, contractual rights
and purchased software, as well as intangible assets, contractual arrangements (management
contracts) and brand marks identified in connection with corporate acquisitions. The company
applies the following amortisation methods and useful lives:


-----

December 2019


**Amortization**


**Intangible assets** **method** **Useful life**

Goodwill - indefinite

Trademarks - indefinite

Acquired concessions, industrial property rights and similar rights and assets straight line 2 - 20 years

Contractual relations straight line 15 - 28 years

Internally developed intangible assets straight line 3 - 5 years

In the 2019 financial year, the contractual relationships were amortised over a remaining useful
life of 16 years for the contractual relationships already existing at the start of the previous
year, and over 15 years for the contractual relationships acquired in the 2019 and 2018
financial years.

**Service concession arrangements**

IFRIC 12 draws a distinction between two types of service concession arrangements. In the
first type, the operator records a financial asset, specifically an unconditional contractual right
to cash receipts or other financial assets from the government in return for constructing or
upgrading public sector assets. In the other type, the operator recognises an intangible asset
– a right to charge for use of a public sector asset that the operator has constructed or
upgraded. A right to charge users is not an unconditional right to receive cash because the
amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service. In the event that a
contract relates to both types of arrangements, IFRIC 12 provides for recognising a financial
asset to the extent that the government has given an unconditional guarantee of payment for
constructing a public sector asset. If the operator is dependent on the public using the service
in order to obtain payment, the operator records a corresponding intangible asset. The firsttime application of this interpretation in the 2008 financial year had the effect that an intangible
asset was capitalised in connection with the conclusion of an association agreement for the
operation of parking facilities. The acquisition costs, which amounted to T€ 4,416 as of 31
December 2019, will be written off over the contract period up to 2028. The carrying amount
as of 31 December 2019 stands at T€ 2,201. The object of the association agreement is the
building renovation of the parking area on the premises of Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg
Medical Clinic), on the one hand, and the related parking facilities management over a term of
20 years, on the other. To enable management of the parking area, parking processing
equipment must be financed by the holder of the concession licence (APCOA PARKING
Group), in return for the right to manage the parking facilities by charging parking fees to third
parties. The APCOA PARKING Group bears the operator risk. For this reason, the service
concession arrangement is recognised in accordance with the intangible asset model.

At the end of the building concession arrangement the construction services performed by the
licence holder are transferred to the ownership of Klinikum Augsburg, either without
compensation, or at fair value, at the option of Klinikum Augsburg.

In the past financial year, revenues in the amount of T€ 1,790 (previous year: T€ 1,870) were
generated in this connection, and earnings of T€ 486 (previous year: T€ 476).

**Goodwill**

The goodwill arising from business combinations represents the surplus of acquisition costs of
the respective corporate acquisition over the Group’s share in the fair value of identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the acquisition date. The goodwill is allocated
to the respective cash generating unit and tested for impairment at least once per year.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is recognised at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
The period over which property, plant and equipment is depreciated is based on the expected


-----

December 2019

useful economic life. In the year of acquisition, property, plant and equipment is depreciated
on a pro rata basis. Residual carrying amounts, useful lives and depreciation methods are
reviewed at least once a year, on the reporting date. Where expectations are no longer in line
with previous estimates, the corresponding changes are accounted for as changes in
accounting estimates in accordance with IAS 8. Right-of-use assets are also shown under
property, plant and equipment because they are recorded under the same balance sheet item
as proprietary assets.

Asset disposals are recognised at historical cost, as well as under accumulated depreciation.
Gains or losses arising on disposals of property, plant and equipment are presented in other
operating income or other operating expenses.

The Group reviews property, plant and equipment for indications of impairment on a regular
basis, and at least as of every balance sheet date. The APCOA PARKING Group applies the
following depreciation and amortisation methods, and useful lives:


**Depreciation**


**Property, plant and equipment** **method** **Useful life**

Land, land rights, buildings and buildings on third party land straight line 10 - 50 years

Technical equipment and machines straight line 3 - 15 years

Other equipment, operating and office equipment straight line 2 - 20 years

**Research and development**

Research and development expenditure is expensed in the period it is incurred, unless it has
to be capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 “Intangible Assets”.

**Equity investments**

All purchases and sales of equity investments are recognised on the trade date.

**Impairment of long-lived assets**

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least
once per year. Impairment tests are performed for intangible assets with limited useful lives,
for right-of-use assets, as well as for property, plant and equipment only if specific indications
are present pursuant to IAS 36 “Impairment of Assets”. If the asset’s recoverable amount is
less than its carrying amount, the impairment adjustment is recognised through profit and loss.
The recoverable amount is normally determined individually for each asset. If this is not
possible, it is determined based on a group of assets that largely generate independent cash
flows. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell, and value in
use. Purchased goodwill is recognised as an asset and impairment tested at least once
annually, as well as when indications of impairment exist. This requires an estimate of the
recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Pursuant
to IAS 36, the starting point to determine the cash-generating units is the company’s internal
management and reporting structure. As the internal reporting structure of the APCOA
PARKING Group is country-based, the corresponding assets and goodwill were allocated to
the respective countries as cash-generating units.

To determine the recoverable value, both the value in use and the fair value of the cashgenerating units to which goodwill is allocated are determined. The leading value concept to
determine recoverable value is the concept of fair value less costs to sell (net realisable value).

The Group is required to apply an appropriate measurement model to determine net realisable
value. This method is based on the discounted cash flow valuation method as an indicator of
fair value.


-----

December 2019

Overall, the valuation method in its entirety belongs to level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
described in IFRS 13 as the valuation of cash generating units includes non-observable inputs.

**Impairment test as of 31 December 2019:**

The periodic impairment test for the APCOA PARKING Group’s goodwill and brand marks was
performed on 31 December 2019 (previous year: 31 December 2018). The impairment test
was based on updated financial plans authorised by the Management Board. When calculating
the risk-adjusted capitalisation rates at the level of the cash-generating units, information
available regarding the total transaction prices paid in the acquisition of the APCOA PARKING
Group was taken into consideration. Management estimates that the market risk premium for
the APCOA PARKING Group has decreased for the 2019 financial year and that a specific risk
increase, which was taken into account in previous years when determining the cost of capital,
was dispensed with. The risk-adjusted capitalisation rates calculated on this basis changed
(after taxes) to rates ranging between 5.11% and 7.42% (previous year: 8.34% and 11.78 %).
The pre-tax interest rate ranged between 5.14% and 7.63% (in the previous year between
10.90% and 16.34%). The planning for the budget and the mid-term plan (detailed planning
period) was carried out on the basis of detailed sales revenue and cost planning over 4 years
(previous year: 5 years) at country and Group level. To this end, assumptions were made
primarily about the future trends in parking fees and occupancy rates, as well as cost trends
and new business. The trends in these assumptions are based on internal Group estimates
and external market studies. Based on past data, the management still assumes that the longterm growth rates can be achieved following the detailed planning period. A uniform growth
rate of 1.00% was applied for the long-term planning (previous year: 1.00%).


**Capitalisation**

Switzerland 5.11% 8.94% 1.00% 1.00%
Ireland 5.94% 10.03% 1.00% 1.00%

Based on the impairment test conducted as of 31 December 2019, no impairment losses were
applied to the cash-generating units. It was also the case that in the previous year no
impairment losses were recognised.

The licence price analogy method was applied to calculate the fair value less costs to sell of
the “APCOA” and “EuroPark” brand marks. To this end, the Group has to select the brandrelevant future cash flows and also an appropriate discount rate to calculate these cash flows’
present value. The cash flows are derived from the corporate planning, with the latest
developments and trends being taken into consideration. They are discounted to the balance
sheet date applying a risk-equivalent capitalisation rate of 5.45% and 7.21% (previous year:
9.30% and 11.83%). The pre-tax interest rate lay between 5.53% and 7.35% (previous year:
13.41% and 15.36%). The detailed planning period was set at 4 years (previous year: 5 years).
The extrapolation of cash flows beyond the medium-term planning period was based on a
constant growth rate of 1.00% (previous year: 1.00%) in consideration of expected price and
volume-based growth. The determination of the brand marks’ fair value less costs to sell was
based on licence rates in the 0.20% – 0.50% range (previous year: 0.20% – 0.50%). The
licence rates are selected on the basis of market analyses and management estimates. In the


-----

December 2019

event that the reason for impairment losses recognised in previous years is no longer valid,
such impairment losses can be reversed to reach a maximum of the original purchase cost.
No need for impairment losses was identified for the brand marks. For this reason, the
company has refrained from calculating a value in use.

**Inventories**

Raw materials, supplies and purchased merchandise are recognised at cost (measurement
applying the weighted average cost method) or, to the extent required, at net realisable value,
whichever is lower. Inventory risks due to limited saleability and excess inventories are
adequately taken into consideration through valuation write-downs.

**Trade receivables**

Trade receivables are recognised at nominal value. Risk provisions are formed taking collateral
into consideration.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents, which include cash accounts and short term cash investments at
banks, cash balances and liquid funds in parking facilities, as well as funds in transit, have
remaining terms of up to three months at the date of addition and are measured at amortised
cost. A provision for risks has been formed.

**Pension provisions**

The actuarial measurement of pension provisions is based on the projected unit credit method
for defined benefit pension plans as stipulated in IAS 19 “Employee Benefits”. Under this
method, consideration is given to both the pensions and acquired vested benefits known at the
balance sheet date and the expected future salary and pension increases and other actuarial
assumptions. The calculation of the pension obligations is based on an actuarial survey that
takes biometric calculation bases into consideration. The interest rate to calculate the
obligations’ present value is calculated, as a matter of principle, on the basis of yields for firstclass fixed interest corporate bonds for the respective currency zone with matching maturities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience-based adjustments and changes in the
actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income under equity in the
period in which they occur, with no effect on profit or loss, and without later recycling to the
income statement. The interest component contained in the pension expense is shown in the
financial result. Income from plan assets is also shown as interest income. The service cost is
presented under personnel expenses.

The amounts to be paid as part of defined contribution plans are recognised through profit and
loss when the contributions are due, and are presented as a component of personnel expense.
Contribution prepayments are capitalised if the prepayments will lead to a refund or a reduction
of future payments.

**Other provisions**

Other provisions are formed for legal or constructive obligations to third parties which arise
from a past event, which are likely to lead to an outflow of resources in the future, and whose
amount can be reliably estimated. The probability that an outflow of resources will occur must
be over 50% (more likely than not). Provisions are formed only for legal or constructive
obligations to third parties. Provisions that do not lead to an outflow of resources in the
subsequent year are recognised at the settlement amount discounted to the balance sheet
date, if the discounting gives rise to a material interest effect. The discounting calculation is
based on interest rates before taxes, which reflect current market expectations concerning the


-----

December 2019

interest effect and, if required, risks specific to the relevant debt. The settlement amount also
includes expected cost increases.

**Financial instruments**

According to IFRS 9 in combination with IAS 32, financial instruments are contractual
arrangements that give rise to a financial asset at one entity and a financial liability or an equity
instrument at another entity. If financial assets’ trading date and settlement date do not
coincide, the date of performance is authoritative for the initial recognition. The initial
measurement of a financial instrument is at the respective fair value. For purposes of the value
measurement, IFRS 9 differentiates between the following categories of assets:

- Financial instruments recognised at fair value through profit or loss,

- Financial instruments recognised directly in equity,

- Financial instruments recognised at amortised cost.

Financial liabilities are classified into two categories, by contrast:

- Financial instruments held for trading which are recognised at fair value through profit and
loss and

- Other financial liabilities.

Subsequent measurement is performed at fair value or amortised cost applying the effective
interest rate method, depending on the categorisation of the financial instruments. The fair
value corresponds to the market or stock exchange price. If no active market or exchange
exists for a given financial instrument, where possible the fair value is determined through the
use of financial mathematical methods such as generally accepted option price models or by
discounting future cash flows at the market interest rate. Amortised cost corresponds to the
acquisition cost less redemption payments, value impairments and the reversal of any
difference between the acquisition cost and the amount repayable at final maturity in
application of the effective interest rate method.

Investments are measured at fair value with no effect on income. On disposal, the change in
value recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to retained earnings. Dividends
are recognised in the income statement unless they represent a capital repayment.

Unless otherwise specified, the fair value of current financial instruments, cash and cash
equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables corresponds to their carrying amounts, due
to such items’ short-term nature.

According to IFRS 9, the impairment model used is based on expected credit losses. The
impairment provisions must be applied to debt instruments that are subsequently measured at
amortised cost or at fair value through equity. Under the general approach, expected losses
are recognised as soon as the asset is recognised. The standard provides for a three-stage
model for determining expected losses.

Under the general approach, financial instruments are allocated to the first stage on initial
recognition and a provision for possible loan losses is recognised by recognising an impairment
loss in the amount of the credit losses expected to be incurred within the next twelve months.
A transfer to Stage 2 occurs if a significant increase in credit risk exists and the provision for
potential loan losses is calculated over the entire term of the expected losses. Whether a
significant increase in credit risk has occurred is assessed by comparing the original probability
of default at the time the instrument was acquired with the probability of default on the balance
sheet date. A significant increase in the credit risk has occurred if the loan is overdue by more
than 30 days. If objective evidence of impairment exists, the asset is transferred to stage 3 and
the impairment loss is measured at the amount of the credit loss expected to be incurred over
the life of the asset. Objective evidence of impairment is assumed in the case of overdue
payments of 90 days and 360 days for fines, respectively. If a low default risk exists on the key


-----

December 2019

date (e.g. investment grade), the financial instrument is assigned to the first step without further
examination.

IFRS 9 also contains a simplified approach for trade receivables and contract assets in
accordance with IFRS 15. Under the simplified approach, an impairment loss is recognised for
all financial instruments, irrespective of credit quality, to the extent of the expected losses over
the remaining term. As a consequence, a blanket allocation to stage 2 is made on addition
and, in the event of objective evidence of impairment, a transfer to stage 3 is made.

For trade receivables and contract assets, impairment is determined using the simplified
approach, while cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets are impaired using the
general model.

For risk provisions for financial instruments classified at amortised cost, the credit risks of the
individual debtors are first segmented on the basis of common default risk characteristics. For
this purpose, the respective debtors are classified according to the type of business
relationship. A diversified analysis of the debtors is performed when determining risk
provisions. The analysis includes information on past payment arrears, current market
information such as credit default swaps and future assessments and, in particular, country
risks and external rating assessments. In the simplified approach, this information is processed
and a risk matrix is derived from it. In the general approach, risk provisions for major borrowers
are calculated on an individual basis. However, clusters are formed with less significant debtors
in order to calculate risk provisions.

The quantification of expected credit losses essentially relates to three risk parameters:
probability of default, loss rate in the event of default and the actual utilisation in the event of
default. Credit risks and associated risk provisions are reviewed regularly and adjusted
accordingly. During the reporting period, no adjustments were made to the estimation
procedure for risk provisions.

**Derivative financial instruments**

Pursuant to IFRS 9, all derivative financial instruments must be recognised at fair value as at
the balance sheet date, independently of the purpose or intention for concluding such
arrangements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments can be positive or negative.
The recognition of changes in fair values – recognition through profit or loss or in other
comprehensive income – depends on whether the derivative financial instruments are
integrated into an effective hedge within the meaning of IFRS 9 or not. In the absence of hedge
accounting, the changes in the fair values of the derivative financial instruments are
immediately recognised through profit or loss. By contrast, if an effective hedge relationship
pursuant to IFRS 9 exists, the hedge arrangement is recognised.

At present, the Group only hedges underlying transactions through cash flow hedges. At the
start of the hedge relationship, both the hedge relationship and the risk management objectives
and strategies of the Group with respect to the hedging are formally established and
documented. The documentation includes information on the determination of the hedging
instrument, the underlying transaction or the hedged transaction and the type of risks being
hedged as well as a description of the manner in which the company determined the
effectiveness of the hedging instrument with respect to the compensation of risks arising from
changes in fair value or the cash flows from the hedged underlying transaction. Such hedge
relationships are assessed as being highly effective with respect to achieving a compensation
of risks arising from cash flow changes. In the case of cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income,
net of deferred taxes, while the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The amounts recognised in equity are reclassified to profit and loss in the period in which the
hedged transaction affects the period result, in other words, at the point when the hedged
financial income or financial expenses are recognised or when an expected sale is carried out.
If a hedge leads to recognition as a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the amounts


-----

December 2019

recognised in equity become part of the acquisition costs of the non-financial asset or nonfinancial liability as of the date of addition.

If the occurrence of the planned transaction or fixed commitment is no longer expected, the
amounts previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit and loss. If the hedging
instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without providing for a replacement or a
rollover of the hedging instrument into another hedging instrument, the amounts previously
recognised in equity are retained in a special equity item until the planned transaction or fixed
commitment is realised.

**Contingencies (contingent liabilities and contingent claims)**

Contingencies are possible obligations or assets arising from past events whose existence or
occurrence (or non-occurrence) depends on one or more uncertain future events, which do not
lie within the Group’s complete control. Contingent liabilities can also comprise current
obligations arising from past events where the outflow of resources representing an economic
benefit is improbable or the scope of the obligation cannot be estimated reliably. Contingent
liabilities are recognised at fair value if they are acquired as part of a corporate acquisition.
Contingent receivables are not recognised. To the extent the possibility of an outflow of an
economic benefit is not unlikely, disclosures on contingent liabilities are provided in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements. The same applies for contingent receivables to the
extent their inflow is likely.

**Income tax / deferred tax**

The income tax expense is comprised of the sum total of current tax expenses and deferred
tax. The current tax expense is determined on the basis of the taxable income for the year.
The Group’s liability for current tax expense is calculated on the basis of applicable tax rates.
Deferred taxes are measured in accordance with the “liability method” stipulated in IAS 12
“Income Taxes”. This means that, with the exception of goodwill arising from consolidation,
deferred taxes are formed for all temporary and quasi-permanent differences between the
values recognised for assets and liabilities in the IFRS and tax balance sheet, irrespective of
the period, in which these differences balance out. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
calculated on the basis of tax rates which are valid or are expected to apply in the respective
countries at the recognition dates. This is based on the tax rates (and tax regulations) that are
valid or announced as of the balance sheet date. Income taxes relating to items that are
recognised directly in equity are recognised under equity and not in profit or loss. Deferred tax
assets are formed for losses carried forward to the extent it is probable that, in the future,
sufficient taxable income will be available that can be offset against the loss carryforwards.

**Leases**

A lease is an agreement that transfers the right to use an asset (the leased asset) for an
agreed period of time in return for payment.

_a) Accounting from 1 January 2019 onwards_

In principle, the lessee’s rights and obligations for all leases must be recognised on the balance
sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are shown under property,
plant and equipment as they are recorded under the same balance sheet item as proprietary
assets. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments that
are not paid as at commencement date. Leasing liabilities include the following leasing
payments:

  - fixed payments, less lease incentives to be paid by the lessor,
  - variable payments that depend on an index or interest rate, and
  - expected residual value payments from residual value guarantees


-----

December 2019

The measurement of the lease liability also includes lease payments based on a reasonably
certain utilisation of extension options. If determinable, the lease is discounted at the interest
rate on which the lease is implicitly based. Otherwise, discounting is applied at the incremental
borrowing rate. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Group uses the risk-free
rate as a starting point and adjusts it to reflect the lessee's credit risk. Further adjustments will
be made for the term of the lease and the currency.

The right of use asset is valued at cost and includes

  - the amount arising from the initial measurement of the lease liability,
  - at or before the provision of lease payments made, less incentives received,
  - initial direct costs, and
  - dismantling obligations.

In subsequent measurement, discounting applied to the carrying amount of the lease liability
is increased to reflect interest and reduced by lease payments made. The right of use is
depreciated on a scheduled basis over the lease term.

Except for cleaning machines and parking space monitoring sensors, the recognition and
measurement requirements of IFRS 16 are not applied to leases where the underlying asset
is of low value. Leases whose term ends within 12 months after commencement date are
recognised as short-term leases under expenses. In the case of contracts that contain nonleasing components in addition to leasing components, the option of not separating these
components is used.

Further information on leases can be found in Chapter (41) Information on leases.

_b) Accounting up to 31 December 2018_

The determination of whether an agreement contains a lease relationship was made on the
basis of the economic content of the agreement at the time the said agreement was concluded
and required assessing whether the performance of the contractual agreement depended on
the use of a specified asset or specified assets and whether the agreement provided a right of
use to the asset. The economic ownership of leased assets was attributed to the contracting
party in a lease relationship that bore the material rewards and risks associated with the leased
asset. In this respect, consideration was given to the length of non-terminable basic lease term
and the share of present value of lease instalments in the total investment, in particular the
distribution of rewards and risks associated with the residual value of the leased asset that was
not amortised during the lease term. The lessee of an operating lease recognised the lease
instalments made during the lease term in profit or loss. If the lessee bore the significant rewards
and risks associated with the ownership of the leased asset (finance lease), the lessee was
required to recognise the leased asset on its balance sheet. The leased asset was measured
at the lower of its fair value or the discounted cash value of the future minimum lease
instalments as at the date of addition, and depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful
life or contract term. The depreciation was recognised in profit or loss. At the asset addition
date, the lessee recognised a lease liability, whose value corresponds to the capitalised value
of the leased asset. The lease liability was repaid and written down in subsequent periods in
accordance with the effective interest rate method.

**Recognition and reporting of sales revenue**

Sales revenues include all proceeds from the Group’s normal business activities. Sales
revenues are reported without value added tax. The five-step model in accordance with IFRS
15 was applied to revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised primarily
based on a point in time. The Group earns sales revenues and income from the performance


-----

December 2019

of services in the area of parking facility management, including the collection of monetary
fines from parking space monitoring in the event of corresponding violations. In accordance
with IFRS 15, revenue is recognised when the customer determines the use of the transferred
services and substantially benefits from them. Revenues from short-term parkers who pay
either in cash or by debit/credit card are recognised when the service has been rendered. As
the end of service provision coincides with the time of payment, these are realised at the time
of payment. Parking services invoiced for short-term parkers are also recognised when the
invoice has been issued and the service obligation has therefore been fulfilled. Contractual
rental arrangements are rental contracts with customers who rent fixed parking places for a
specified period. Revenues from these leases are billed monthly and are recognised over the
period. Sales revenues from management agreements are generated with the provision of
management services for a contracting party, such as maintenance, monitoring, fee collection
etc. In return, the Group receives a management fee. This can have both fixed and variable
components. Revenues from management contracts are also recognised on a period-related
basis, as the Group’s performance obligations are fulfilled over a longer period of time. Fines
issued on leased property are recognised when issued at a point in time. When recording sales
in the area of parking facility monitoring and “On-Street” with Parker as a customer, sales are
recognized immediately in the amount of the fines if the inflow of payment is probable.
Otherwise, revenue is recognized at the time the parker pays the fines. In both cases, it is a
point-in-time revenue recognition. If the parking space monitoring is carried out on behalf of
the landowner, the revenue recognition is carried out over time. Advertising, e.g. on tickets or
in multi-storey car parks, is also realised periodically, as the tickets are distributed over several
months or the advertising is displayed in the multi-storey car parks.

Income from parking space rentals agreed in connection with the concession agreement is
recognised on an accrual basis as presented above.

**Recognition of other income and interest income**

Other income is recognised on the basis both of a point in time and over a period. Interest
income is recognised pro rata temporis.

**Expense recognition**

Other expenses are recognised when the service is utilised or when the expense is incurred.
Interest payments are expensed pro rata temporis.

### 3. Notes to the consolidated income statement

**(11)** **Sales revenues**

The Group generates revenues in the area of parking facilities management. The revenues
are composed as follows:


**2018**


**T€**


**Sales revenues according to sales type**


**2019**

**T€**


Short-term parking 383,105 356,185

Management agreements 126,263 114,826

Contract parking 82,472 81,347

Parking facility monitoring and "On-Street" 76,829 60,553

Other services 57,697 58,072

Sales deduction (5,745) (4,929)

**Total** **720,620** **666,055**

Within the context of agency business and lease agreements, revenues from parking facilities
monitoring are generated by the issuance of parking tickets for incorrect parking on private


-----

December 2019

properties, while “On-Street” revenues are generated by issuing parking tickets for incorrect
parking on public properties.

Other services mainly include income from the reimbursement of operating costs and of
expenses relating to management agreements in the amount of T€ 13,082 (previous year: T€
17,907), reimbursements of other administration and operating costs, and construction
services in the amount of T€ 6,832 (previous year: T€ 7,063), fees paid to the company by taxi
businesses for the use of parking space located on the business premises of the company in
the amount of T€ 7,917 (previous year: T€ 8,839) and income from advertising activities in the
amount of T€ 1,068 (previous year: T€ 1,168).

Revenues from short-term parking, parking space monitoring and “On-Street” are recorded on
the basis of a point in time, while revenues from management contracts and from long-term
parking are recorded on the basis of a period. Revenues from other services are mainly
recorded on a period basis.

Sales revenues by region are composed as follows:


**2018**


**T€**


**Sales revenues according to region**


**2019**

**T€**


Region Central (Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Switzerland) 277,796 269,329

Region North (Norway, Sweden, Denmark) 249,446 224,635

Region West (United Kingdom, Ireland) 118,174 102,985

Region South/ East (Italy, Poland) 75,203 69,105

**Total** **720,620** **666,055**

**(12) Other income**


**2019**


**2018**


**Other income** **T€** **T€**

Own work capitalized 3,080 886
Out-of-period income from adjusted trade receivables and other liabilities 1,974 2,005
Income from disposal of property, pant and equipment 1,812 302
Income from release of other provisions 1,637 351
Rental income 214 206
Income from admonition 194 117
Foreign currency income 100 17
Income from release of valuation allowance on trade receivables 60 327
Miscellaneous other income 6,037 8,726

**Total** **15,108** **12,938**

In the previous year, the release of provisions for pending losses was recognised as an item
netted with the other change in the corresponding provision, and recognised as income under
other operating expenses. See also note 16 “Other expenses”. As this was a provision for
onerous losses on leases as defined by IFRS 16, this procedure is no longer applicable in the
current financial year due to the application of IFRS 16.

Income from the disposal of property, plant and equipment in the 2019 financial year includes
proceeds of T€ 377 from a sale and leaseback transaction.

The work performed by the company and capitalised relates to the capitalisation of the
company’s own development and installation costs for intangible assets and parking facilities.

As in the previous year, miscellaneous other income in the year under review includes income
from the reimbursement of insurance claims and compensation payments.


-----

December 2019

**(13) Lease expenses**

The company’s lease expenses in the 2019 financial year are composed as follows:


**2019**


**2018**


**Lease expenses** **T€** **T€**

Variable 184,126 181,355
Fixed 5,203 136,660
Other lease expense 135 219
Incentive agreements - 321

**Total** **189,464** **318,555**

Due to the first-time application of IFRS 16, the previous operating lease expenses, including
any incentive agreements, are not presented anymore unless they relate to expenses from
short-term and low-value leases as well as variable lease payments and incidental costs.
Instead depreciation resulting from the right of use assets and interest expenses from the lease
liabilities are presented. For further notes, please see sections (3) and (10).

Based on mostly long-term lease agreements, the company is obligated to make fixed lease
instalments as well as performance-based variable lease instalments. In this context, the
variable component of the lease expense is generally calculated on a percentage basis in
relation to the sales revenues generated. The fixed lease expenses for 2019 are expenses for
short-term leases or leases of low value. The other lease expense consists exclusively of lease
instalments for advertising space.

**(14) Cost of materials and purchased services**

The cost of materials and of purchased services is composed as follows:

**Costs of materials** **2019** **2018**
**and of purchased services** **T€** **T€**
Cost of maintenance and repair 19,386 19,421
External other services 19,233 18,058
Ancillary operating costs 14,267 14,855
Consumables 8,335 6,590
Other 1,645 2,026

**Total** **62,866** **60,950**

Maintenance repair costs are at the previous year’s level and include expenses for
maintenance in an amount of T€ 13,635 (previous year: T€ 12,085) and expenses for the repair
of technical equipment and buildings in an amount of T€ 5,751 (previous year: T€ 7,335).

The higher maintenance expenses (T€ 1,550) relate primarily to car parks in the UK and
Ireland. The lower expenses for maintenance and repairs (T€ -1,585) mainly relate to a garage
in Italy.

The external other services relate mainly to external service providers’ fees in connection with
parking facility supervision in the UK and Italy. Significant further external services include:
expenses for payment cards of T€ 5,186 (prior year: T€ 4,655), T€ 2,045 (prior year: T€ 2,283)
for cleaning services, T€ 1,380 (prior year: T€ 1,477) for cash management expenses in
connection with customer payments received and T€ 919 (prior year: T€ 1,108) for snow
removal.

The increase in other external services is mainly due to higher expenses for parking facility
monitoring (T€ 1,046), particularly in the UK, Norway, Denmark and Italy, and increased
transaction costs for payment cards (T€ 537), particularly in the UK. This is offset by a
decrease in expenses for cleaning services (T€ -238) and snow removal expenses (T€ -189).


-----

December 2019

Ancillary operating costs comprise mainly energy costs of T€ 5,513 (previous year: T€ 5,290),
other ancillary costs (gas, water etc) of T€ 5,631 (previous year: T€ 5,386), and expenses for
public charges in an amount of T€ 3,119 (previous year: T€ 3,061).

The increase in energy costs of T€ 223 is primarily due to higher energy costs in car parks in
Italy. The increase in other ancillary costs of T€ 245 arises mainly from the overall increase in
operating costs in Germany.

Expenses for supplies mainly included the costs of general operating supplies required for
sustaining operating activities.

The year-on-year increase of T€ 1,745 is mainly due to higher expenses in Poland for so-called
Pay&Display (P&D) machines.

**(15) Personnel expenses**

The personnel expenses are composed as follows:


**2019**


**2018**


**Personnel expenses** **T€** **T€**

Wages and salaries 152,830 145,077

Social security 24,222 21,545
Other short-term employee benefits 4,945 3,518

**Total** **181,997** **170,141**

Wages and salaries for the financial year 2019 include bonus payments to the management in
the amount of T€ 5,103 (previous year: T€ 6,424). In addition, the total includes severance
payments incurred during the reorganisation in the amount of T€ 502 (previous year: T€ 2,078)
made to employees who had left the company.

Pension expenses mainly comprise contributions to defined contribution pension plans in an
amount of T€ 4,824 (previous year: T€ 3,466), as well as additions to pension provisions.

Further information about pension provisions can be found in note 36 “Provisions for pensions
and similar obligations”.

The number of employees as of 31 December 2019 is as follows:

**Staff** **31/12/2019** **31/12/2018**
Blue collar workers 4,928 4,741

Employees 428 401
Management 111 112

**Total** **5,467** **5,255**

December 2019

**(16) Other expenses**

The company’s other expenses related to the following items:


**2019**


**2018**


**Other expenses** **T€** **T€**

Audit and consulting costs 10,107 13,714
Expenses for temporary workers 7,947 6,343
Car pool (leasing, gasoline, etc.) 7,102 7,356
IT expenses 6,186 6,171
Telecommunications 5,327 5,292
Marketing expenses 3,760 3,965
Insurance expenses 3,737 3,707
Expenses for business trips 3,715 3,289
Rental expenses, administration 2,798 5,615
Expenses for office furniture and fixtures 1,966 1,257
Addition to value adjustments concerning trade receivables 1,427 1,439
Bank charges 562 547
Refinancing costs - 10
Net position onerous contracts - (4,225)
Miscellaneous other expenses 14,400 10,136

**Total** **69,033** **64,616**

In the previous year, the expenses from the allocation to provisions for onerous contracts were
shown as a net item under other operating expenses together with the other changes in the
provision, resultant in the recognition of income of T€ 4,225. This related exclusively to leasing
agreements. As of the 2019 reporting year, this presentation no longer applies, as provisions
for onerous contracts are no longer recognised for leases that now fall within the scope of IFRS
16.

The decrease in audit and consulting costs of T€ 3,607 is mainly due to lower expenses for
strategy consulting and structural development.

A T€ 1,604 increase in expenses for temporary staff correlates with the positive expansion of
business activities in the 2019 reporting year.

The “rental expenses, administration” item in the amount of T€ 2,798 (previous year: T€ 5,615)
includes all rental expenses and ancillary operating costs for office space of the general
administration function. The decrease in the amount of T€ -2,817 arises from the first-time
mandatory application of IFRS 16 and associated changes in the accounting treatment of
leases.

Higher expenses for office equipment (T€ 709) are mainly due to higher expenses in the UK
as a consequence of acquisitions.

The increase in miscellaneous other expenses of T€ 4,263 is chiefly due to expenses for due
diligence performed in the year under review.

Miscellaneous other expenses also mainly include other administrative expenses of T€ 2,633
(previous year: T€ 2,568), public-sector levies of T€ 1,932 (previous year: T€ 1,287), and T€
1,131 of costs for training and further training (previous year: T€ 1,049).

**(17) Amortisation, depreciation and (reversal of) impairment losses**

Amortisation, depreciation and (reversal of) impairment losses relating to intangible assets, to
property, plant and equipment and right of use assets were composed as follows as of 31
December 2019:


**2018**


**T€**


**Amortisation / depreciation**


**2019**

**T€**


Scheduled amortisation / depreciation 161,079 30,204
Non-scheduled amortisation / depreciation 564 526
Reversal of write-down (1,445) 
**Total** **160,198** **30,730**

The increase in total depreciation and amortisation arose primarily from the first-time
application of IFRS 16. Further details concerning amortisation, depreciation and impairment
losses are provided in notes 21 “Intangible assets” and 22 “Property, plant and equipment”.
The reversals of impairment losses in 2019 relate to right-of-use assets under leases that were
impaired due to the deduction of the existing provision for onerous contracts from the right-ofuse assets as part of the first-time application of IFRS 16 as of 1 January 2019.

Financial income from third parties 166 360
Financial income from banks 42 164
Other financial income 111 180

**Total** **2,183** **1,202**

Currency gains reported under financial income result from the periodic measurement of loans
denominated in foreign currencies and the cash pool accounts in relation to the affiliated
companies. The cash pool accounts are managed in the respective local currency. Further
disclosures on foreign currency loans are provided in notes 34 “Financial liabilities” and 43
“Group risk management”.

Currency losses 3,845 3,401
Other financial expenses 569 1,556

**Total** **77,765** **25,436**

The increase in financial expenses is primarily due to interest expenses from leases, which
were recognised for the first time in the 2019 financial year with the first-time application of
IFRS 16. In the 2018 financial year, this item included only interest expenses on finance leases
in accordance with IAS 17.

The increase in the year under review in financial expenses due to banks mainly reflects a
regular drawing on the revolving credit facility. In addition, the bank loan, which was taken out


-----

December 2019

in March 2017 after the existing syndicated loan was repaid, was increased by a further
nominal amount of € 40 million in May 2019.

The currency losses relate to interest-bearing liabilities to both banks and associated
companies denominated in a currency other than the functional currency, such as euros, pound
sterling, Norwegian kroner and Swedish kroner, held as loan currency at the companies with
other functional currencies. The currency losses are primarily due to the bank loan, which was
denominated entirely in euros. This led to corresponding currency losses in the 2019 financial
year, mainly at the subsidiaries in Sweden and the UK.

Please refer to the comments in the note 43 “Group risk management” for more information
about financial income and expenses.

**(20) Income tax**

Corporation tax in Germany stands at 15% plus a 5.5% solidarity surcharge on the assessed
corporation tax. In Germany, fiscal units for income tax purposes exist between APCOA
Parking Holdings GmbH as the controlling entity and APCOA Parking Deutschland GmbH and
Park & Control PAC GmbH as controlled companies.

The average trade tax rate was 14.90% (previous year: 14.90%). The individual trade tax rate
depends on the established municipal factors applied in the municipalities in which the
company is active.

The total tax rate for the financial year 2019 was 30.73% (previous year: 30.73%).

The inventory of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of 31 December 2019 was
allocable to the following balance sheet items and losses carried forward:

they satisfy certain criteria.

Deferred taxes reported under equity result from the revaluation of pension obligations and the
first-time application of IFRS 16.


-----

December 2019

Interest carried forward by APCOA Parking Holdings GmbH amounts to T€ 32,578 (previous
year: T€ 28,960). Deferred tax assets were recognised in an amount of T€ 8,771 (previous
year: T€ 7,820), as it is probable that they will be utilised in future periods.

The deferred tax liabilities allocable to intangible assets in the amount of T€ 35,422 (previous
year: T€ 34,961) are attributable mainly to intangible assets, contractual relationships and
brand marks identified in connection with the corporate acquisitions realised in 2007. Deferred
tax liabilities reflecting appreciations in value as well as the recognition of assets as part of
purchase price allocations are reduced within the scope of the write-down of the assets over
their useful lives. They will not be cash-effective in the future.

Deferred tax assets in an amount of T€ 28,869 (previous year: T€ 17,175) are non-current.
Deferred tax liabilities in an amount of T€ 35,808 (previous year: T€ 32,512) are non-current.

The amounts of expenses and income relating to deferred taxes and taxes on income were
composed as follows in the financial year:


**2018**

**T€**


**Current and deferred taxes**


**2019**

**T€**


Current tax expense 9,152 10,802

Deferred tax income (7,094) (5,753)

**Total tax expense / (income)** **2,058** **5,049**

The current tax expense was allocable mainly to the tax expense for the current financial year.
A tax expense of T€ 531 was incurred from previous periods (previous year: T€ 1,271).

The following table shows the tax reconciliation statement concerning the income tax expense
(or income) expected in the respective financial year with the tax expense (or income) actually
reported. The expected tax expense (or income) was determined by multiplying earnings
before taxes by the corporate tax rate of 30.73% valid for the 2019 financial year (previous
year: 30.73%).

**Total tax expense / (income)** **2,058** **5,049**

The reported tax rate differences derive from the difference between the Group tax rate and
the individual companies’ individual tax rates, as well as from changes to tax rates that affect
the calculation of deferred tax.

In total, tax loss carryforwards exist in an amount of T€ 93,414 (previous year: T€ 103,410).
Today’s assessment regarding the usability of tax losses carried forward may change in future

December 2019

years depending on the company’s respective financial performance and, in such case, would
require that the deferred taxes be adjusted to the losses carried forward.

In relation to tax loss carryforwards that arose in 2019, no deferred tax assets were formed for
an amount of T€ 622 (previous year: T€ 95), as realisation of the tax assets is not likely due to
the positive tax results in the planning period under IAS 12. Most of the tax loss carryforwards
can be carried forward on an indefinite basis.

As in the previous year, no deferred taxes were formed for differences arising in connection
with interests in subsidiaries (so-called outside basis differences), since the profits of the
foreign subsidiaries are available to them for reinvestment purposes.

**Goodwill impairment test – sensitivity analysis**

Given a ±1% change in weighted average cost of capital, the following sensitivities arise in relation to the excess of the recoverable amount over
the carrying amount of the cash-generating units:


**Sensitivity analysis:** **Surplus / deficit of fair value net of selling costs**

The significantly increased headroom when compared to the previous year is mainly due to the reduction in the cost of capital (see also chapter
(10)).

The “APCOA” brand mark as well as the “EuroPark” trademark were acquired as part of the acquisition of the APCOA PARKING Group. The
carrying amount of the “APCOA” brand mark stands at T€ 23,185 as of the reporting date (previous year: T€ 23,185). The carrying amount of
the “EuroPark” brand mark amounts to T€ 3,260 as of the reporting date (previous year: T€ 3,233). The brand marks have an indefinite useful
life. The brands are being utilised to further expand the Group. The “APCOA” and “EuroPark” brand marks were impairment tested in the
financial year under review. This entailed calculating the recoverable amount as the capital value of the future licensing fee that is saved that
would be incurred if a fee were to be paid to a third party to utilise the brand marks. The underlying data are based on the management’s past
empirical data and expectations of future market trends. As in the previous year, no need for impairment or reversal of impairment was
identified in the current financial year.

December 2019

The increase in property, plant and equipment arises primarily from the first-time application of
IFRS 16. For further information, please see section 1. General.

The property, plant and equipment are subject to reservations of ownership and restraints on
disposal in the amount of T€ 1,171 as of 31 December 2019 (previous year: T€ 1,005). Moreover,
debts were collateralised through assigning property, plant and equipment in an amount of   T€
5,844 (previous year: T€ 8,074). As of the balance sheet date, contractual obligations concerning
purchases of property, plant and equipment were reported in the amount of T€ 221 (previous
year: T€ 67). This mainly relates to contractual obligations in Italy to purchase vehicles.

Impairment losses of T€ 49 in the current financial year relate to buildings on third-party land
owned by a subsidiary in Sweden. Further impairment losses amounting to T€ 515 and reversals
of impairment losses amounting to T€ 1,445 were applied to right-of-use assets from leasing
agreements in Germany as well as in Norway depending on their positions or negative
commercial trends in 2019.

**(23) Investments accounted for using the equity method**

On 4 January 2019, APCOA Parking Belgium and a partner founded the joint venture ParcBrux
with a registered capital of T€ 200, of which 50 percent (T€ 100) is attributable to APCOA.

On 4 October 2018, the company acquired a 13.33% interest in AGILE PARKING SOLUTIONS
PRIVATE LIMITED, New Delhi, India. This company has one seat on the Supervisory Board of
this company.

Both investments in equity accounted companies are immaterial associates or joint ventures
within the meaning of IFRS 12.

The equity investments belong to the category of financial instruments measured at fair value
with no effect on income and consist of interests in unlisted companies with a shareholding of
less than 20%. Assets are measured at fair value. The change in fair value is recognised directly
in other comprehensive income as these investments are not part of the core business but are
held for strategic purposes.

Provisions for losses on loans and advances are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk
characteristics arising from the various services and jointly tested for impairment and, if
necessary, written down. Historical credit loss data are taken into consideration in this context.
Furthermore, macroeconomic inputs such as country ratings are included to take future
developments into consideration. These are utilised to create devaluation matrices that
adequately reflect the receivables’ risk structure. Specific defaults lead to the derecognition of
the relevant receivables. An indication of a potential default event is defined as an overdue event
of 360 days, as no further settlement is expected at this point in time. Receivables are adjusted
to reflect the expected realisable payments at values based on past experience. Derecognition
occurs at the latest after two years, or in the fines business concurrently with the default event.

A year-on-year increase in impairment adjustments of T€ 415 was reported in the year under
review. The rise in the valuation allowance is mainly due to the increase in receivables.

Of the receivables for leased parking spaces, T€ 1,732 (previous year: T€ 2,638) have been
deposited as collateral, which are not part of the risk provision.

consolidated subsidiaries have been assigned under the relevant national law (for example,
collateral assignments or liens). Such receivables due from consolidated companies as well as
the assigned shares in consolidated subsidiaries are eliminated as part of consolidation. For this
reason, these items were not included in the net carrying amounts of the leased assets. The
carrying amount of the receivables assigned to third parties amounted to T€ 39,045 as of the
balance sheet date (previous year: T€ 34,214). Furthermore, bank deposits have also been

The provisions for anticipated losses contain the future results for loss-making contracts, the
majority of which are leases within the scope of IFRS 16. Since the transition to IFRS 16 in
2019, provisions for onerous contracts on leases are no longer recognised on the balance
sheet; instead, any necessary impairment is applied to the right of use. In the 2018 financial
year, this provision was calculated in accordance with IAS 37 on the basis of the future income
and expenses of each individual contract. The provisions for onerous contracts existing as of
31 December 2018 were deducted from the respective right-of-use assets at the time of firsttime application.

The rental provisions contain the estimated expenses for parts of rental payments, where the
amount and point in time are uncertain.

The personnel provisions include provisions for long-service awards, deferred compensation
and employee assistance payments. While no significant provisions for further personnel costs
were formed in the current financial year for severance and redundancy payments as part of
the reorganisation of the APCOA PARKING Group, the amount in the previous year was  T€
1,796.

Furthermore, miscellaneous other provisions mainly relate to the Italian company APCOA
Parking Italia S.p.A. in an amount of T€ 3,492 (previous year: T€ 3,734).


-----

December 2019

The Italian subsidiary has received tax assessments from the municipal authorities in Palermo
for garbage collection fees (Tarsu) for the years 2006 through to 2013. In the 2019 financial
year, the company paid an amount of T€ 516 for all claims up to 2019 and concluded an
agreement with the landlord under which the latter undertakes to assume all claims of the City
of Palermo arising from waste tax. This recourse claim was capitalised in the amount of the
provision and plus T€ 250 for amounts already paid.

In total, the Italian company has formed provisions of T€ 1,197 for possible payment
obligations.

**(36) Provisions for pensions and similar obligations**

Staff of the APCOA PARKING Group are granted pension entitlements according to different
programs. These concern both defined contribution and defined benefit plans.

**Defined contribution plans**

In the case of defined contribution plans, the company pays contributions to an independent,
external entity (fund). Defined contribution plans exist in Austria, Ireland, the UK, Norway,
Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. Once the contributions have been paid, the company
incurs no further performance obligations or risks. The current contribution payments are
recognised as expenses for the current year in the operating result, and amounted to a total of
T€ 4,545 in the 2019 financial year (previous year: T€ 3,362).

**Defined benefit plans**

All other pension plans are defined benefit plans and are subject to different pension
arrangements.

**Joint pension plan of several employers in Norway: This plan is based on participation in**
a joint pension plan in Norway in the form of legally specified employer’s contributions to
pensions (AFP). The pension plan includes also benefits for employees taking early retirement.
Employer’s contributions are salary-based and are paid for all employees through to their 62nd
birthdays.

**_Defined benefit plan in Germany:_** A defined benefit plan exists in Germany that arises
exclusively from pension entitlements acquired in the past. The pension benefits include oldage retirement benefits as well as disability benefits and benefits for surviving dependants in
line with the pension regulations. The benefit is contingent on the length of service and the
salary of the beneficiary.

**_Defined benefit plan in Austria:_** The pension scheme in Austria includes severance
payments, required to be paid by the Group to employees engaged prior to 1 January 2003.
Employees who were engaged after 1 January 2004 are entitled to severance payments from
the employee pension fund (Mitarbeiterversorgungskasse). The severance payments for these
employees represent a defined contribution plan according to IAS 19.

**_Defined benefit plan in the UK:_** The United Kingdom pension scheme includes old-age
retirement and benefits for surviving dependants according to beneficiary, and benefits in the
event of the beneficiary’s death through an occupational accident. The benefit is contingent on
the professional status, years of company service and the salary of the beneficiaries.

**_Other defined benefit plans: According to the Swiss Occupational Pension Act (BVG), all_**
employers are required to provide employees with post-employment retirement benefits. The
pension benefits are financed through pension funds, so-called collective foundations, which
manage the pensions. Both employer and employee contributions are rendered to the pension
fund, whereby the company’s total contributions must correspond at least to the employee


-----

December 2019

contributions as set out in the plan terms. Given insufficient cover, either the employer or
employee contributions are increased, and a minimum rate of interest can be decided upon,
or other measures permitted by law. Due to the minimum guarantees, such plans are allocated
to defined benefit plans according to IAS 19. The following presentation includes the defined
benefit scheme of APCOA Parking Service Switzerland AG and of Real Estate Schaffhausen
GmbH.

The defined benefit plans of APCOA Parking Switzerland AG and APCOA PARKING Belgium
N.V. are immaterial for the Group. For this reason, the company has refrained from presenting
them in greater detail.

December 2019

The main benefit obligations exist in Germany in an amount of T€ 2,256 (previous year:   T€
1,996), in Switzerland in an amount of T€ 2,145 (previous year: T€ 1,889) and in Austria in an
amount of T€ 1,258 (previous year: T€ 1,123).

The obligations connected with the defined benefit pension commitments are partly covered
by plan assets, comprising both reinsurance and separate pension vehicles. Plan assets are
currently deployed in the UK and Switzerland. Assets in the UK are invested as follows:


**2018**


**T€**


**United Kingdom**


**2019**

**T€**


Equities 303 251

Corporate bonds 345 241

Gilts 167 321

Property  -  
Cash 230 191

**Total** **1,045** **1,004**

In Switzerland, the plan assets are invested up to an amount of T€ 1,590 (previous year: T€
1,502) according to the strategy of the collective foundation (VZ BVG). A detailed analysis of
the asset allocation is not possible, and the assets are to be classified as “other investments” as
a consequence. A total of 100% of the assets are listed on an active market.

For the 2020 financial year, the Group anticipates contributions to defined benefit pension
plans amounting to a total of T€ 166 (previous year: T€ 270), and outgoing payments of T€ 97
(previous year: T€ 125).

In connection with the defined benefit pension plans, the company is exposed to various risks
such as general actuarial risks (longevity risk etc) and financial risk (interest-rate risk, capital
market risk, investment risks etc).

The weighted average term in years of the pension obligation amounts to 19 in Switzerland at
APCOA Parking Service Switzerland AG (previous year: 19) and 23 at Real Estate

December 2019

Schaffhausen GmbH (previous year: 22), 14 in Germany (previous year: 14), 14 in the UK
(previous year: 12), 10 in Italy (previous year: 10), and 10 in Austria (previous year: 12).

An increase or decrease in the discounting factor by one half percentage point would reduce
the present value of the obligations from the Group’s internal pension schemes by T€ 383 or
lead to an increase of T€ 572, respectively. An increase or decrease in the pension trend by
one half percentage point would increase the present value of the obligations from the Group’s
internal pension schemes by T€ 247 or lead to a decrease of T€ 94, respectively.

The sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an individual assumption with all other
assumptions remaining unchanged. In actual fact, deviations are quite likely. The methods for
calculating the above sensitivities and calculation of the pension provisions are consistent. The
impact of other actuarial assumptions is insignificant. For this reason, the company has
refrained from making a related presentation.

The revaluation gains in the financial year under review of T€ 550 (previous year: T€ -191) are
offset with the other reserves. The total gains from revaluation of pensions reported under
consolidated equity amount to T€ 3,024 (previous year: T€ 2,473). Deferred taxes recognised
directly in the consolidated equity amounted to T€ 519 (previous year: T€ 378).

**31/12/2018**


**Other non-current liabilities** **T€** **T€**

Amounts accrued and prepayments received 41 6,160

The decline in other non-current liabilities is due to the introduction of IFRS 16, as these

### 5. Notes to the consolidated statement of cash flows

**(39) Consolidated statement of cash flows**

The cash flow statement shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents of the Group
resultant from cash inflows and cash outflows during the reporting year. In accordance with
IAS 7 “Statements of Cash Flows”, the presentation of the cash flow statement is differentiated
according to cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. The effects of
currency fluctuation on cash and cash equivalents that are held in foreign currencies or are
due in foreign currencies are presented separately from the cash flows from operating,
investing and financing activities.

The funds in the cash flow statement comprise exclusively the cash and cash equivalents as
reported on the balance sheet (cf. note 29). This includes bank credit balances in the amount
of T€ 1,797 (previous year: T€ 2,039), which the Group may only use for specific purposes
owing to statutory provisions or contractual obligations.

The changes in liabilities from financing activities are subdivided in the following table
according to cash and non-cash components. For the adjustment of leasing liabilities on the
time of first-time application of IFRS 16 (January 1, 2019), see Chapter (3) Basis for the
preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

The change in liabilities to banks derives from a cash change of T€ 24,330 and a non-cash change of T€ 19,218. The cash change results from
cash inflow from borrowings in the amount of T€ 42,154, interest and bank charges paid in the amount of T€ -16,899 and transaction costs paid
in the amount of T€ -924. The non-cash change derives from the deferring of interest on bank fees as well as transaction fees in an amount of T€
19,782 and a foreign currency change of T€ -564.

The changes in liabilities from leases are commented on in Chapter (41).

Only liabilities from the loan in Switzerland are reported under other financial liabilities in this overview. The change in cash collateral deposited
is not shown in this overview as it is not related to financing activities.

### 6. Other disclosures

**(40) Contingent liabilities**

Contingent liabilities are possible liabilities that could arise from past events, whose existence
will only be confirmed by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events that lie, however,
beyond the Group’s scope of influence. Furthermore, current obligations also represent
contingent liabilities when the related utilisation is not probable and/or the amount of the
obligation cannot be estimated with reasonable certainty. In the course of its ordinary business
activity, the company can become involved in litigation disputes, claims for damages,
investigative and court proceedings, including issues involving product liability and economic
disputes.

In the view of the Management Board and its legal advisers, as of 31 December 2019 no other
significant occurrences existed that could have a material effect on the company’s business,
financial position and financial performance, except for those listed below.

APCOA Parking Italia S.p.A. received a tax assessment notice from the City of Avellino regarding
charges and fees for occupying public land (TOSAP) for a total amount of € 11.5 million for the
2013 to 2017 period (including interest and penalty surcharges). These assessments from 2013
until April 2015 were successfully contested at the first and second instance. The municipality
lodged a related appeal. The company has filed an objection against the assessments as of May
2015.

The management currently assumes that the risk of utilisation is unlikely. Moreover, the
possibility exists that the resultant risk can be transferred to the garage’s owner. For this reason,
the provision has not been formed in this set of consolidated financial statements as of 31
December 2019.

**(41) Information about leases**

**The Group as lessee**

Up to and including 2018, leases were classified as either finance or operating leases. As of 1
January 2019, leases are recognised as right-of-use assets and as corresponding lease liabilities
at the time when the leased asset is available for use by the Group.

The Group leases parking space, parking buildings, office buildings, plant, machinery and
vehicles, among other assets. Rental agreements are usually concluded for fixed periods of 6
months to 30 years, but may have extension and/or termination options. A description of how the
Group assesses whether options are included in the lease liability is set out in chapter (10). A
change in the assessment of the exercise of options previously considered as not reasonably
certain by the Group could significantly increase the lease liability and the corresponding rightof-use assets. Options, the extension of which the Group does not consider to be reasonably
certain as of December 31, 2019, can result in significant future cash outflows. There are no
significant extension options on the part of the lessors. Rental terms are negotiated individually
and include a variety of different terms. This also includes variable payments depending on one
and / or several different factors such as sales revenue or frequencies of the respective rental
space. For some rental space, up to 100% of the lease payments depend on the sales achieved.
Variable payment terms are used for various reasons, among other things to minimize the fixed
cost basis to which the group is exposed and to establish a connection with the economic
development of the rental space. Depending on the level of relevant factors, the Group is
exposed to higher or lower expenses from variable leasing payments. In the 2019 financial year,
the ratio of fixed lease payments to variable leasing expenses was 87%, i.e. the variable
components outweighed the fixed lease payments. In view of the corona epidemic (see chapters
(43) and (46)) and the associated decrease in frequency, management expects that the ratio will


-----

December 2019

shift slightly in favour of fixed leases in 2020. Beyond the 2020 financial year, there will be cash
outflows from variable lease payments in the future.

In order to optimise leasing costs during the term of the contract, the Group grants residual value
guarantees in some cases, primarily for vehicles and machinery.

As of 31 December 2019, it was assumed that an amount of T€ 235 would be payable due to
residual value guarantees received, which is recognised accordingly in lease liabilities.

In the 2019 financial year, financial liabilities from leases amounting to T€ 114,257 were repaid,
and T€ 53,509 in interest paid in connection with leases. As of the balance sheet date future
cash outflows arose in an amount of T€ 1,308,871.

The right-of-use assets under leases are recognised in property, plant and equipment at carrying
amounts of T€ 909,493, which are analysed by class as follows:

Land, land rights and buildings and buildings on third party land 899,126

thereof within the reporting period recognised expenses for scheduled depreciation 128,783

Technical equipment and machines 10,366

thereof within the reporting period recognised expenses for scheduled depreciation 4,477

Other equipment, operating and office equipment 1

thereof within the reporting period recognised expenses for scheduled depreciation 5

The income statement includes the following amounts relating to leases:

**2019**

**T€**

Expenses related to short-term lease agreements 6,663

Expenses related to lease agreements regarding assets with low value 1,190
Expenses related to lease agreements with variable lease payments 184,165
Expenses/income related to extraordinary allowances/value recoveries on right of use
assets (930)

Further information on interest expenses on leases can be found in chapter (19) Financial
expenses and on right-of-use assets in chapter (22) Property, plant and equipment.

**The Group as lessee – 2018**

Finance leases: The economic ownership of leased assets is attributed to the lessee if the lessee
bears the significant opportunities and risks associated with the leased asset. The Group’s
finance lease transactions relate primarily to parking garages and other equipment, operating
and office equipment, such as parking facilities. The lease agreements partly include lease
extension and purchase options. Conditional rental payments are calculated, inter alia, on the
basis of sales revenues generated with the leased assets, as well as through business indicators
agreed upon either individually or on a macroeconomic basis. The conditional rent payments
recognised through profit and loss in the previous financial year amounted to a total of T€ 12,549.

The following table shows the net carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date of assets
recognised as part of finance leases:

**Net carrying amounts of capitalised lease items** **T€**

Land, land rights and buildings and buildings on third party land 18,752

Technical equipment and machines 9,196

**Total** **27,948**

The present value of the future minimum lease instalments is recognised as a liability for the
resultant payment obligation from the finance lease as of the reporting date. In subsequent years,
the lease instalments to be rendered to the respective lessors reduce the liability in the amount
of the repayment portion. The payments’ interest portion is recognised in profit or loss.

**Minimum lease payments** **Incl. interest comp.** **Present values**

Due after five years 10,278 1,841 8,437

**Total** **31,783** **5,204** **26,579**

Operating leases: The economic ownership of lease transactions remains with the lessor, if the
latter bears the significant opportunities and risks associated with the leased asset. The Group’s
obligations from non-terminable operating leases relate primarily to multi-storey parking space,
office buildings, parking facilities, and other business and office equipment. Some contracts
include extension options and price adjustment clauses. Contingent rental payments are based
mainly on sales revenues generated with the leased asset, on income generated with the leased
asset, and on general price indices. As of the previous year’s balance sheet date, no future
minimum lease payments existed that are expected to be received due to non-cancellable subtenancies.

The operating lease expenses recognised in profit or loss are composed as follows:


**Expenses from operating leases**


**2018**


**recognised in profit/loss** **T€**

Minimum lease expenses 141,720

Conditional rental payments 184,003
Expenses from sub-leases 346

**Minimum obligation from operating leases** **T€**

Due within one year 160,105

Due between one and five years 516,439
Due after five years 552,746

**Total** **1,229,290**

**(42) Additional disclosures on financial instruments**

According to IAS 32, financial instruments are contracts that give rise to a financial asset at one
entity and a financial liability or equity instrument at another entity. The additional disclosures
required by IFRS are provided in the corresponding sections of the consolidated financial
statements. Please refer, in particular, to the comments under notes 34 and 43.

**(43) Group risk management**

The Group’s risk management covers different levels and risk types. At the Group level, risk
management is a significant component of the business planning and controlling processes.
Material risks are monitored and discussed periodically with the Advisory Board. The Group has
established upper limits for certain risks. The tasks of risk identification and risk controlling within
the Group are performed by the Group Treasury function. Group Treasury reports to the
Management Board on a regular basis and is supported by local risk assistants. Certain
transactions require prior authorisation by the Management Board.

**Financial risk management**

The Group is exposed to various financial risks that arise from the operating business activity
and the financial activities of the Group. The most important financial risks for the Group derive
from changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit standing and solvency of counterparties
of the Group. The periodic reporting of risks is performed by the corresponding controlling
functions within the Group. A stringent and stable financing structure is stipulated for the Group
aimed at compliance with the agreements for external financing concluded within the framework
of the syndicated credit agreement (covenants). Compliance with the covenants is monitored
on a regular basis.

Derivative financial instruments may only be used for hedging purposes. Depending on the risk
assessment, selective derivative financial instruments and non-derivative hedging instruments
are deployed. Hedging transactions for hedging of the default risk are generally concluded only
with leading financial institutions.

1) Their value is calculated on the basis of quoted, unadjusted prices on active markets.

2) Fair value calculation is based on parameters for which directly or indirectly derived quoted prices are available on an active market.

3) Fair value is calculated on the basis of parameters for which no observable market data are available.

December 2019

Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other financial assets predominantly have
short remaining terms. For this reason, their carrying amounts approximate fair value on the
reporting date.

Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and other financial assets are short-term. As a
consequence, the respective carrying amounts as of the balance sheet date approximate their
respective fair values.

The fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate their fair value were calculated
on the basis of the present values of payments connected with the assets and liabilities, taking
into consideration the respective current interest parameters that reflect market- and partnerrelated changes in terms and expectations.

The fair values of derivative financing instruments are calculated on the basis of valuation
models based on inputs observable on the market.

The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated applying methods discounted
cash flow (DCF) methods.

The fair value of investments categorised at fair value with no effect on income is determined
utilising recognised valuation models with the aid of market multiples.

**Credit risk**

Credit risks arise from the possibility that counterparties to a transaction are not in a position
to fulfil their obligations, and that this will lead to financial loss for the Group. The maximum
credit risk, without consideration of any additional collateral or other credit enhancements,
corresponds to the carrying amount of the financial assets of the Group. The Group accounts
for the credit risk by forming corresponding value adjustments.

Trade receivables: For historical reasons, the company does not see any high risks of bad
debt losses. Any and all doubtful accounts receivable are value-adjusted. Uncollectible
receivables are written off in full. Trade receivables are subjected to active risk management
with a focus on the monitoring of current receivables. Reference is also made to the remarks
in section (28) Trade receivables and other financial assets. Receivables management has
the goal of improving the Group’s liquidity through the optimised use of assets while at the
same time maintaining an acceptable risk level. The danger of risk concentration is viewed
as low within the Group since the majority of trade receivables are due from long-term tenants.
These receivables are characterised by broad-based geographic distribution and a large
number of different debtors. The risks are monitored according to country and type of
counterparty on a regular basis. No risk concentration per country exists within the Group.

Receivables due from customers in an amount of T€ 2,689 (previous year: T€ 2,736) are
covered by collateral (mainly deposits).

**Liquidity risk**

Liquidity risks arise when financial obligations exceed financial assets at any point in time.
The Group manages liquidity risks by maintaining an adequate, readily available reserve for
ensuring the required level of liquidity at all times. The Group’s liquidity is monitored on an
ongoing basis. An additional T€ 33,997 can be drawn from the revolving credit facility as
required. A further line of the Guarantee Facility in an amount of T€ 31,729 can be utilised for

bill guarantees. In the 2019 financial year, the Group had free lines of T€ 33,997 available
from the Revolving Credit Facility and T€ 35,820 from the Guarantee Facility. For further
details, please see note (34) Financial liabilities.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020 and its impact on sales, the
liquidity risk of the APCOA PARKING Group has significantly increased. Management has
taken measures to ensure sufficient liquidity. These include, among other things, reductions
in investments, reduction in operating and overhead costs by adapting activities and
measures such as short-time work patterns. By mutual agreement, solutions are sought for
both sides together with our partners rents are reduced, their composition of fixed / variable
components is adjusted or payment postponements are agreed. The revolving credit facility
existing on December 31, 2019 has been used in full (€ 35 million). On March 30, 2020, the
Swiss companies APCOA Parking Switzerland AG and APCOA Parking Service Switzerland
AG took out state-guaranteed loans totalling TCHF 800 with a term of 5 years. In negotiations
with the capital providers on the equity and debt side, the company has adjusted the current
capital structure in order to secure the liquidity situation. On May 27, 2020, the owners made
a cash contribution to the capital reserve of T€ 40,000 and the company made use of another
financing facility (facility B2) of T€ 68,000. This bullet loan facility is of equal rank and has the
same term as the existing bullet loan facility of T€ 514,000 (Term Loan Facility B). The interest
rate for this new facility is 7.25% p.a., the interest on term loan B has been adjusted by 0.5%
points and is currently 3.75%. The credit terms have been adjusted and rights resulting from
the delay in the transmission of the annual financial statements have been waived.

**Going concern**

At the end of 2019, the APCOA Parking Group had at its disposal a final-maturity loan of  T€
420,000 (Term Loan Facility B) and a guarantee facility of T€ 50,000 (Guarantee Facility
B) from a new syndicated loan. The initial term of the loan amounts to 7 years and ends in
March 2024. Term Loan Facility B was increased by T€ 94,000 on 31 January 2020, T€ 90,000
was paid out to the shareholders from the capital reserve.

The Group complied with all of the earnings and liquidity-based financial covenants set out in
the terms of the syndicated loan agreement.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred in 2020, the APCOA Parking Group is
economically significantly burdened. The group has created several models with different
scenarios for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. A liquidity risk determined in some
scenarios was covered as part of the COVID-19 financing, which was bindingly agreed in May
2020, as were the liquidity requirements from corresponding “worst case” scenarios.
Management believes that the package of measures described under section Liquidity risk is
sufficient to ensure going concern of the company and is also sufficiently dimensioned to
safeguard further negative developments from the COVID-19 pandemic. According to
management’s assessment the Group’s solvency and compliance with the amended credit
terms is secured and it is expected to continue as a going concern. The financial statements
have been prepared on the going concern basis as a consequence. The company is in a tight
liquidity situation due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the company's continued
existence as a going concern is dependent on the avoidance of another economic standstill
and on successful continuation of operations after the end of the most significant adverse
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should these risks materialize, the Group may not be able
to realize its assets or settle its liabilities. The ability to continue as a going concern is
threatened.

**Market risks**

A market risk arises from changes in the market prices of the Group’s financial assets and
liabilities. A market risk can affect the operating result, financial result and equity of the Group.


-----

December 2019

With respect to the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses showing
the effects of hypothetical changes in the relevant risk variables on income and equity. In
addition to currency risks, the Group is also subject to an interest rate risk. The periodic effects
are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in the risk variables to the portfolio of
financial instruments at the balance sheet date. It is assumed that the portfolio at the balance
sheet date is representative for the year as a whole.

**Currency risk**

The Group is active across Europe and is consequently exposed to currency fluctuation risks
that may affect the financial results and equity of the Group. A currency risk arises when
amounts paid or received for transactions in local currencies fluctuate as a result of changes
in the currency exchange rates (transaction risk). In addition, currency risk may arise through
the translation into euros of consolidated subsidiaries’ financial statements whose functional
currency is not the euro, when preparing consolidated financial statements (translation risk).
The Group’s objectives in managing foreign currency risks are to maintain the economic value
of its current and future assets and to minimise the volatility of the Group’s financial results.
Foreign currency risks pursuant to IFRS 7 arise from financial instruments that are
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and are monetary in nature;
exchange-rate-based differences resultant from the translation of financial statements into the
Group currency are not taken into consideration. In general, all non-functional currencies in
which the Group maintains financial instruments are considered as relevant risk variables.

The currency sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:

Significant original monetary financial instruments (liquid assets, receivables, liabilities from
leases and non-interest-bearing liabilities) are denominated directly in the functional currency,
with a few exceptions. Exchange rate fluctuations do not have any material effect on the
results or equity of the Group at this time. Non-interest-bearing securities and equity
instruments held are not monetary and are consequently not associated with any currency
risk pursuant to IFRS 7.

Interest income and interest expenses arising from financial instruments are recognised
directly in the functional currency for the most part. In the 2019 and 2018 financial years, the
currency sensitivity analysis showed no effects from liabilities to banks, as the newly arranged
syndicated lending agreement is denominated exclusively in euros.

Interest-bearing liabilities not denominated in the functional currency also related to
receivables and liabilities to Group companies denominated in euros, pounds sterling,
Norwegian kroner, Swedish kroner, Danish kroner, Polish zloty and Swiss francs. The
sensitivity analysis is shown in the following table.

**Interest rate risk**

Interest rate risks arise from changes in interest rates, which can impact negatively on the
financial result and equity of the Group. Interest rate fluctuations can lead to changes in
interest income and interest expense. In addition, they can affect the market value of certain
financial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The main objective in managing interest
rate risks within the Group is to keep the net interest result stable. The interest rate and foreign
currency development is monitored at weekly intervals and reported to the Management
Board and the shareholders. Further hedging measures are taken when and if required.

Interest rate risks are presented by means of sensitivity analyses as required by IFRS 7,
which present the effects of changes in the market interest rates on interest payments,
interest income and interest expenses, other components of income and possibly the effects
on equity. Sensitivity analyses are based on the following assumptions:

 - Changes in the market interest rate of original financial instruments carrying fixed
interest rates only affect the result if they are measured at fair value. Accordingly, all
fixed-interest financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost are not
associated with any interest risks pursuant to IFRS 7.

 - Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that are deployed as hedging
instruments as part of a cash flow hedge for hedging interest-based payment fluctuations
have effects on the hedging reserve under equity and are consequently taken into
consideration in the equity capital-based sensitivity calculations.

 - Changes in the market interest rate impact on the interest result from original variableinterest bearing financial instruments, whose interest payments are not designated as
underlying transactions in the framework of cash flow hedges against interest risks, and
are consequently included in the calculation of earnings-based sensitivity factors.

If the level of market interest rates had been higher by 100 basis points in the 2019 financial
year, other comprehensive income would have been lower by T€ 334 (previous year: T€ 383)
and the result for the year would have been lower by T€ 2,308 (previous year: T€ 3,884). Had
the level of market interest rates been lower by 100 basis points, other comprehensive income
would have been higher by T€ 368 (previous year: T€ 422) and the result for the year would
have been higher by T€ 0 (previous year: T€ 0).

**Hedging measures – cash flow hedges**

In the financial year under review, the Group had two DKK interest rate swaps (amortising;
previous year 2) to hedge variable interest from lease liabilities. A variable-interest financial
lease liability was designated as the hedged item for the amortising swaps denominated in
DKK. Changes in the cash flow from the hedged items arising from the change in the 3-month
CIBOR rate are compensated for (on a quarterly basis) by the cash flow changes in the
interest rate swaps. The hedging measure is aimed at transforming a part of the variableinterest lease liabilities into fixed-interest lease liabilities and consequently to hedge the cash
flow from the financial liabilities. The amortising interest rate swaps denominated in DKK with
a nominal value of T€ 5,288 (previous year: T€ 6,009) have a residual term until June 2032.

The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is assessed prospectively using the critical
terms match method. As all input parameters that determine the value match, the hedging
relationship is effective. Reasons for ineffectiveness may derive from different credit risks
between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. A regular check is performed to ensure
that credit risk does not dominate in the case of hedged items and hedges. Retrospectively,
a possible ineffectiveness is measured applying the dollar offset method.

**Interest hedge**


**Average net investment**


**Fixed interest rate of**

**hedge instrument**


**Maturity** **T€**

Due within one year 4,509 6.0%

Due between one and five years 3,075 6.0%

Due after five years 1,207 6.0%

As of the balance sheet date all hedge relationships of this type were considered as highly
effective. The fair value of interest-rate derivatives deployed as hedging instruments
amounted to T€ 1,502 within the Group as of 31 December 2019 (previously: T€ 1,553). The
fair value is reported under non-current financial liabilities. In the 2019 financial year, the
realisation with neutral effect on profit/loss led to a value change of the hedging transactions
in the amount of T€ -51 (previous year: T€ -219). Under Danish tax law, the negative market
value of the DKK swaps is tax deductible. Due to this, no deferred taxes are to be recognised
in connection with the DKK interest rate swaps, and the recognition in equity is at the net
value. The change in value from the underlying transaction amounted to T€ -51. This leaves
a reserve of T€ 1,502 in the OCI.

In connection with the DKK interest rate swaps, other comprehensive income decreased by
T€ 296 in 2019 (previous year: T€ 347) and a reclassification of T€ 347 (previous year: € 514)
was made to net interest income, resulting in a change of T€ 39 in equity after taking deferred
tax into consideration (previous year: T€ 167). No ineffectiveness arose in the reporting
period.

**Capital management**

The Group defines its managed capital as the consolidated equity including minority interests.
The goals of capital management include:

 - the possibility to secure the Group’s continuation as a going concern with a view to being
able to continue offering top quality parking space management to customers, and
earnings to investors.

 - to be able to offer investors appropriate income based on the risks that are entered into.

 - having the financial resources that enable the Group to invest in areas that will generate
further earnings for investors.

APCOA PARKING Group's capital management strategy aims to ensure that the group
companies have an equity base that meets local requirements. In addition, financial indicators
(covenants) are agreed for the group in the syndicated loan agreement, which are determined
based on the consolidated figures of the APCOA PARKING Group disregarding effects from
the application of IFRS 16. For this purpose, a pro-forma EBITDA is calculated, considering
both one-time effects and future business development, thus determining a level of gearing
that must not exceed a factor of 7.5. Compliance with these key figures is regularly checked
by the management of the APCOA PARKING Group and the syndicate banks. All externally
imposed capital requirements were met in the 2019 financial year. The COVID-19 pandemic
that occurred in the 2020 financial year has a negative impact on the financial key figures of
the APCOA PARKING Group, which is why the Group has adjusted its forecasts and, on this
basis, the covenants of the loan agreement.

At the beginning of January 2020, APCOA acquired all outstanding shares of the Swedish
parking operator XPERT Parkering Sweden AB, which manages around 40,000 parking
spaces with a geographical focus on the Skåne region in southern Sweden. The agreed
purchase price for the company was SEK 55 million (T€ 5,265), which was paid in cash by the
Swedish subsidiary APCOA PARKING Sverige AB. In addition, a performance-related
contingent consideration of up to SEK 25 million (T€ 2,393), possibly due until 2021, was
agreed. Further information is currently not available because the purchase price allocation
according to IFRS 3 has not yet been carried out.

In the 2020 financial year, part of the capital reserve was released with the shareholder
resolution of 31 January 2020 in an amount of T€ 90,000, with an equivalent distribution to
Park Luxco 3 S.C.A. This payment to Park Luxco 3 S.C.A. and the related costs were financed
by increasing the existing final maturity loan by T€ 94,000. As part of the same transaction, the
margin for the entire loan was reduced by 0.5% to 3.25%.

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health
Emergency of International Concern due to the outbreak of the coronavirus. Since March 11,
the WHO has classified the spread of the coronavirus as a pandemic.

The further course of the spread of the corona virus and the consequences on the business
development of the group are continuously monitored. Based on the latest developments, the
management assumes that the spread of the corona virus and the necessary containment
measures and the associated frequency drops will have a major negative impact on the
Group's business activities and net assets, financial position and results of operations for 2020.
In negotiations with the capital providers on the equity and debt side, the company has
achieved an adjustment of the current capital structure in order to secure the liquidity situation.
For further details, please refer to Chapter (43) Group Risk Management and the Group
Management Report.
