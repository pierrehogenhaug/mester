**Afflelou**
**€410.0 million  % Senior Secured Notes due 2026**
**€75.0 million Senior Subordinated Floating Rate Notes due 2027**


Afflelou, a société par actions simplifiée organized under the laws of France (the "Issuer"), is offering (the "Offering") €410.0 million aggregate principal amount of its      % senior
secured notes due 2026 (the "Senior Secured Notes") and €75.0 million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated floating rate notes due 2027 (the "Senior **Subordinated**
**Notes" and, together with the Senior Secured Notes, the "Notes"). Each series of the Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (each an "Indenture") dated on or about    , 2021**
(the "Issue Date") among, inter alios, the Issuer, U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), and U.S. Bank Trustees Limited, as security agent (the "Security Agent").
The Senior Secured Notes will bear interest at a rate of      % per annum and will mature on      , 2026. The Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes semi-annually
in arrears on each       and      , commencing on      , 2021. Interest will accrue from the Issue Date. At any time prior to      , 2023, the Issuer will be entitled, at its option,
to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date plus a "make whole" premium, as described in this offering memorandum (the "Offering Memorandum"). At any time on
or after      , 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices set forth herein. In addition, prior to      , 2023, the Issuer may redeem
at its option, up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of any additional notes issued) with the net
cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price specified herein.
The Senior Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a rate equal to three month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus       basis points per annum, reset quarterly, and will mature
on      , 2027. The Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes quarterly on each      ,      ,        and      , commencing on      , 2021. Interest will
accrue from the Issue Date. At any time on or after      , 2023, the Senior Subordinated Notes may be redeemed at the redemption prices set forth herein. Prior to on      , 2023,
the Issuer may also redeem all or a portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes redeemed
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date plus a "make whole" premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum.
The Issuer may also redeem all but not less than all of the Notes upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding
amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event, each
holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to repurchase all or a portion of its Notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.
A change of control triggering event, however, will not be deemed to have occurred if a ratings downgrade has not occurred. In addition, even if a ratings downgrade has occurred, a
change of control triggering event will not be deemed to have occurred if a specified consolidated net leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event. The Issuer shall, if
an IPO Event (as defined herein) has occurred (and subject to certain exceptions), redeem the Notes with the net cash proceeds received by the Issuer from certain secondary equity
sales at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes"
and "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes".
On or around the Issue Date, the Notes will be guaranteed by 3AB Optique Développement and Alain Afflelou Franchiseur (collectively, the "Issue Date **Guarantors") and, within 60**
days of the Issue Date, by Alain Afflelou International, 3ABOE, LSFA and L'Opticien Afflelou (the "Post-Issue Date Guarantors" and, together with the Issue Date Guarantors, the
"Guarantors"). The Senior Secured Notes will be general senior obligations of the Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the "Senior Secured Notes Guarantees") by the
Guarantors and will rank equally in right of payment to all other existing and future senior obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, respectively, rank senior in right of payment to
any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Senior
Subordinated Notes will be general obligations of the Issuer and will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer,
including the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. The Senior Subordinated Notes will be
guaranteed by the Guarantors on a subordinated basis (the "Senior **Subordinated Notes Guarantees" and, together with the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the "Guarantees").**
The Guarantees will be subject to certain limitations as described under "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees
_and the Security Interests" and may be released in certain circumstances. See "The Offering—Guarantees". On or around the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior_
Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests over certain assets of the Issuer and the Issue Date Guarantors (collectively, the "Issue Date
**Collateral") along with obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if any, certain hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness; and the Senior**
Subordinated Notes will be secured on a second-priority basis by the Issue Date Collateral. Within 60 days of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis by security interests over certain assets of the Post-Issue Date Guarantors and certain of the Issue Date Guarantors (collectively, the
"Post-Issue Date Collateral" and, together with the Issue Date Collateral, the "Collateral") along with obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if any, certain
hedging obligations and certain other future indebtedness; and the Senior Subordinated Notes will be secured on a second-priority basis by the Post-Issue Date Collateral.
Pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, after an acceleration event in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Subordinated Notes or
other debt subject to the New Intercreditor Agreement, neither the Issuer nor the Guarantors may make payments in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantees except in connection with the realization or enforcement of the Collateral by the Security Agent as described under "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and
_Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement", in which case such payments will be applied in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain hedging obligations_
and certain other future indebtedness until such obligations are repaid in full prior to the repayment of the Senior Secured Notes. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and
_Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement". In addition, the Collateral will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles (as defined herein) and limitations under applicable law_
and may be released under certain circumstances. Such payments will be applied in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes only after the Senior Secured Notes are repaid in full.
See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement", "The Offering—Security", "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests" and "Risk Factors—Pursuant to the subordination provisions in the New Intercreditor_
_Agreement, there is a doubt as to the ability of holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to recover in relation to an enforcement action premised on the Senior Subordinated Guarantees"._
The security interests in the Collateral will be subject to legal limitations that may materially limit their enforceability. See "Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral" and "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests"._
There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to list the Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit them for trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or
otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available the Notes to any retail

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"),

EU MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014

qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union
("IFRS") and the Issuer's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six
months ended January 31, 2021, which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the
six months ended January 31, 2020, prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the standard of IFRS as
adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial statements, which, in each case, are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Constantin Associés (member of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu Limited), the Issuer's statutory auditors for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The Issuer's
audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019, and 2020 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer's statutory auditors
for those years. The Issuer's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six
months ended January 31, 2021 which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the
six months ended January 31, 2020, were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and

attention to the matter disclosed in note 6.3.2, which describes lawsuits, disputes and related
uncertainties.

**IFRS 16**

**_Context and methodology_**

On January 13, 2016, the IASB issued a new standard on leases, IFRS 16. This results in the
recognition of most leases using a single accounting model in the balance sheet, comprising a right-ofuse asset representing the right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing the
obligation to make payments (replacing the classification as operating or finance leases for lessees).
The new standard, adopted by the European Union, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2019 and has therefore been applied by the Group from August 1, 2019. The Group
has elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach offered by the standard. As from
August 1, 2019, lease liability is calculated by discounting the remaining rents, taking into account the


-----

estimated remaining term of the various leases. On the transition date, right-of-use assets were
recognized in an amount equal to that of the lease liability or, by determining their carrying amount as
if the standard had been applied since the most recent of the following dates: inception of the lease,
most recent renewal, or takeover of the entity/activity carrying the lease within the meaning of IFRS 3,
and then discounting it using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of first application. This option
will be used for the most material leases. The choice of this transition approach means that prior period
comparative information is not restated. The Group has also decided to make use of the exemptions
permitted by the standard for short-term contracts (less than 12 months) or for low-value assets. The
term of the leases are the non-cancellable term plus the periods covered by an extension option whose
exercise is reasonably certain, and the periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise is
reasonably certain.

The Group disclosed its future minimum lease payment commitments pursuant to IAS 17, and payment
commitments received in respect of subleases in its annual financial statements. The amount of these
commitments is significantly lower than the liability under IFRS 16 as off-balance sheet commitments
were limited to the non-cancellable period of the contracts (IAS 17.35) and did not take into account
extensions and/or the non-exercise of the cancellation options considered reasonably certain by the
management, within the meaning of IFRS 16.

**_Description of Group's leases liabilities_**

Most of the Group's leases relate to real estate leases for the rental of commercial premises and, to a
lesser extent, office space. The Group is also an intermediary lessor on sublease agreements with
franchisees. As a lessor, the Group currently records its leases as operating leases, recognizing
sublease income in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the sublease. For the Group's
leases as lessor, the analysis carried out ahead of the transition led the Group to qualify them as finance
leases. This qualification will result in the derecognition of the right-of-use asset relating to the main
lease and the recognition of the net investment in the sublease as a financial receivable. Sublease
agreements will result in the recognition of financial income corresponding to the effect of discounting.

**_Impact on financial statements and presentation by the Group_**

The impact of the IFRS 16 standard on the Group's EBITDA is an increase mainly corresponding to
rent expenses in connection with store rental agreements. This EBITDA impact is balanced between a
depreciation on right of use assets and a finance charge on leases. In the Group's consolidated
statement of financial position, the new IFRS 16 standard resulted in lease liabilities balanced with right
of use assets and sublease financial receivables. The Group has presented and commented on its
financial statements from August 1, 2019 under the new IFRS 16 presentation and describes, when
necessary, the main changes under IFRS 16 standards in its financial statements and presents
indicators as if they were calculated pre-IFRS 16. Below is a summary of the main impact of the IFRS
16 standard on the Group's financial statements for the periods under review.

**LTM Information**

This Offering Memorandum also presents unaudited financial information of the Issuer for the twelvemonth period ended January 31, 2021 which was calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information for the six months ended January 31, 2021 extracted from the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period
ended January 31, 2021, to the audited consolidated financial information for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2020 extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020, and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for
the six months ended January 31, 2020 extracted from the unaudited comparative financial information
for the six-month period ended January 31, 2020 included in the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended January 31, 2021.

The unaudited financial information of the Issuer for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2021
has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not necessarily indicative
of our results of operations for any future period, is not prepared in the ordinary course of the Issuer,
has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act,
the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards.

**Optimil Disposal in October 2018**

In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil
discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in implementing the various components of
the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the
Optimil banner and focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a
potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018 and the disposal was
completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were
treated as discontinued operations in the income statement of our audited consolidated financial
statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were
not treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

Finally, the Optimil operations are also presented separately with respect to our network key
performance indicators, such as network sales, like-for-like network sales growth and store counts.

**Segment Information**

In accordance with IFRS 8 (Operating Segments), our business is organized according to the following
geographical segments:

  - _France. The "France" segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of_
franchised and directly-owned stores in France (including our online and e-commerce
activities);

  - _Spain._ The "Spain" segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of
franchised and directly-owned stores in Spain (including Andorra); and

  - _Other countries._ The "Other countries" segment, which includes the optical business of
franchised and directly-owned stores in countries outside France and Spain, including Algeria,
Andorra, Belgium, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Kuwait, Lebanon, Luxembourg,
Morocco, Portugal, Senegal, Switzerland, Togo, Tunisia and Vietnam as of January 31, 2021.

**Other Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS measures, including Adjusted EBITDA,
Normalized EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net capital expenditure, free cash flow, free cash flow
conversion, network sales and like-for-like network sales growth.

You should exercise caution in comparing Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
margin, net capital expenditure, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, network sales and like-forlike network sales growth to similarly titled measures of other companies. The information presented by
each of Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net capital expenditure, free
cash flow, free cash flow conversion, network sales and like-for-like network sales growth is unaudited


-----

and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the
presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements
of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; compliance with its requirements would require the
Issuer to make changes to the presentation of this information.

Definitions and, if applicable, reconciliations to IFRS measures, are presented under "Summary
_Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information"._

**_Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin_**

"Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as operating income from ordinary activities (excluding non-recurring
items and the impact on income from discontinued operations) as presented in our consolidated
financial statements, before (i) depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, and
intangible assets and right-of-use assets, (ii) changes in provisions for trade receivables and inventories
and provisions for depreciation of right-of-use assets on property, plant and equipment and (iii) the
management fees and bonuses payable to management.

"Normalized EBITDA" for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 has been calculated by adding
our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended January 31, 2021 (the first half of the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2021) (which reflects the application of IFRS 16) to our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months
ended July 31, 2019 (the second half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as adjusted to reflect an
estimate of the impact of the application of IFRS 16 during that period), as further described in footnote
14 under "Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial
_Information"._

We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 is a measure that
assists in understanding our performance by substituting Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended
July 31, 2020 with Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019, which is more
representative of our Adjusted EBITDA performance and takes into account the cyclicality of our
business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA
for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 might not represent what our Adjusted EBITDA would
have been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular,
Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened
or could have happened during the six months ended July 31, 2020, other than the events directly
related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of the 100% Santé changes in the optical
sector or the increase in number of our stores or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative effect of the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the six months ended January 31, 2021, in particular the impact
of catchup demand for our products during periods immediately following the reopening of our stores
after the end of confinement measures, as well as the impact of further restrictive measures which have
been implemented by the governments in the countries in which we operate, notably in November 2020
and January 2021 in France, in response to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Normalized EBITDA has been prepared solely for the purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is not
necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period, is not prepared in the ordinary
course by the Issuer, has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X
under the Securities Act, the Prospectus Directive or any generally accepted accounting standards.

"Adjusted EBITDA margin" is defined as (i) Adjusted EBITDA divided by (ii) revenue.

Neither Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA margin is a measurement of
performance under IFRS and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA or
Adjusted EBITDA margin as an alternative to operating income or consolidated profit, as a measure of
our operating performance, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as a measure
of our ability to meet our cash needs or any other measures of performance or liquidity under generally
accepted accounting principles. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA margin are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist
securities analysts, investors and other parties in evaluating us. Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA
and Adjusted EBITDA margin and similar measures are used by different companies for different
purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. Adjusted
EBITDA, Normalized EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be indicative of our historical
operating results, are not meant to be predictive of potential future results and undue reliance should
not be placed upon these measures when evaluating an investment decision. Adjusted EBITDA,
Normalized EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should
not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are:


-----

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or
contractual commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to
service interest or principal payments on our debt;

  - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated
and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements that would be
required for such replacements; and

  - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Normalized
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as
comparative measures.

See "Risk Factors—Risks related to our financial profile and capital structure—Normalized EBITDA
_presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment_
_decision"._

**_Net Capital Expenditure, Free Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow Conversion_**

**“Free cash flow" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax**
paid. We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the level of cash generated by the
Issuer after payment of our net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid. Free cash flow has
limitations as an analytical tool. Free cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and
should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of financial position as determined
in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on free cash flow figures,
free cash flow figures are unaudited and are not part of our accounting system. Free cash flow is not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should
not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the Issuer’s cash flows as
determined in accordance with IFRS.

"Free cash flow conversion" is defined as (x) Adjusted EBITDA minus (i) net capital expenditure and
(ii) income tax paid divided by (y) Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that this ratio is a useful indicator of
the level of cash generated by the Issuer after payment of our net capital expenditure and (ii) income
tax paid, compared to our Adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion is not a presentation made in
accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of
financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control
procedures on free cash flow conversion, free cash flow conversion is unaudited and is not part of our
accounting system. Free cash flow conversion is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a
substitute for analysis of, the Issuer’s cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS.

“Net **capital** **expenditure” represents the sum of (i) purchases of intangible assets, (ii) purchases of**
property, plant and equipment and (iii) proceeds from disposal of intangible assets and property, plant
and equipment. We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the funds we use to
acquire, upgrade, and maintain our physical assets, adjusted to reflect the depreciation and
amortization of such assets. Net capital expenditure is not a presentation made in accordance with
IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on net capital expenditure, net capital
expenditure is unaudited and is not part of our accounting system. Net capital expenditure is not
necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should
not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, any of the Issuer’s financial
measures determined in accordance with IFRS.

**_Network Sales and Like-for-Like Network Sales_**

We also present network sales and like-for-like network sales growth in this Offering Memorandum.
Network sales include all optical and hearing aid sales generated by the stores bearing our various
banners (including franchised stores and directly-owned stores) as well as online sales. Network sales
as reported by our franchisees do not reflect financial information of the Issuer itself, but rather are
based on reported monthly statements prepared by our franchisees in accordance with the provisions
of our franchise agreements. While we review and conduct control procedures on network sales figures,
network sales are unaudited and are not part of our accounting system. Due to certain changes in our


-----

scope of consolidation, our network sales data may not be entirely comparable. For example, given the
sale of Optimil, a discount banner in Spain, in October 2018 (as discussed above), network sales for
Spain are presented herein exclusive of the Optimil banner for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018 and
2019. Network sales are not an audited figure and therefore investors should not place undue reliance
on network sales.

Like-for-like network sales correspond to sales generated by stores which were open throughout the
periods under review, based on a full fiscal year, and which did not undergo any substantial changes
during such periods (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than
one month), in order for sales performance in a period to be comparable to that of the prior period. The
calculation of like-for-like network sales does not take store closures in connection with COVID-19 into
account. Like-for-like network sales are calculated at constant exchange rates (applying the prior year's
exchange rates to the current year), as a very small portion of network sales are currently exposed to
currency risk. Like-for-like network sales growth has not been adjusted based on the potential impact
on network sales resulting from the different number of working days between two periods. The growth
in like-for-like network sales for a given period corresponds to the increase in sales in stores which were
open throughout the entire relevant period under consideration and the entire prior year and for which
no substantial changes (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than one
month) or closures have occurred during the period under consideration.

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key
_factors affecting our results of operations—Network sales" and "Risk Factors—Risks related to our_
_franchise activities—We rely on franchisee's accurate reporting of their sales as a key performance_
_indicator and the basis of calculation of fees owed by franchisees"._

**Overview**

Founded by Mr. Alain Afflelou in Bordeaux in 1972, we are a leading optical product and hearing aid
franchisor in Europe. We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both
revenue and number of stores and the Alain Afflelou banner is the third-largest optical banner overall in
terms of number of stores, with a 10% market share in 2019 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and
excluding online sales) in a fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers
(according to SWV). In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network
Spain, our second core domestic market, where we had 336 stores as of January 31, 2021. In 2019, we
operated the largest optical product franchise network in Spain (in terms of number of stores) and were the
fourth largest optical retail chain, with a 7% market share in 2018 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and
excluding online sales) (according to SWV). As of January 31, 2021, France, Spain and Other countries, our
three geographic segments, represented 67%, 23% and 10%, respectively, of our stores. The retail sale of
optical products and hearing aids represented 94% and 6%, respectively, of our network sales for the six
months ended January 31, 2021.

Building on our significant market share in our core geographic markets, France and Spain, we have grown
our store networks to 1,435 stores as of January 31, 2021. Our like-for-like growth is in part the result of
market growth at a CAGR of 1.2% and 1.8% in France and Spain, respectively, from calendar year 2015 to
calendar year 2019. In addition, for the same period, network sales for the Alain Afflelou banner have grown
at a CAGR of 4.0% and 2.8%, in France and Spain respectively, and outperformed the market by an average
of 2.8% and 1.0%, in France and Spain respectively, per year as a result of our brand power and our premium
store locations, mainly in city centers and large shopping malls. Our intensive and long-term marketing and
advertising efforts and campaigns (including in partnership with key brand ambassadors) have driven the
success and power of our brand. In our two main secondary markets, Belgium and Switzerland, network
sales for the Alain Afflelou banner grew at a CAGR of 6.4% and 7.3%, respectively, between 2015 and 2019,
versus a CAGR of 1.6% for the market as a whole in each of those geographies.

We have been strategically adapting our store perimeter in recent years, which has led to an increase in
profitability over the period from 2016 to 2019. As mentioned below, we rely on our strong brand and large
network of franchisees. Each additional store that we open (either in our directly-owned stores network or in
our franchisee store network) allows us to benefit from economies of scale by spreading our fixed costs over
a broader base of stores and sales potential. Such fixed costs include, among other things, administrative
fees and structural costs, franchisor and technical support costs and warehousing and inventory
management costs, as well advertising and marketing costs relating to the promotion of our brand (which we
believe will in turn benefit a larger number of stores and generate a greater volume of sales).

The essential, healthcare nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that may,
at best, be sometimes delayed but rarely deferred completely. Most of our products are purchased by our
customers as a result of a prescription or a medical need. For example, for the six months ended January
31, 2021, 93% of our network sales were generated on sales of glasses (representing 86% of our total
network sales) or hearing aids (representing 7% of our total network sales) that were purchased with a
prescription. According to 2020 data from Gallileo, 83% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing
new glasses was the result of a medical need, as compared to 16% who indicated it was based on personal,
non-health-related preferences. In addition, according to 2020 data from Arcane, 89% of customers surveyed
indicated that their last eyewear purchase was for prescription glasses. These dynamics create resilience
and predictability in our sales as customers and replace prescription products in regular and fairly short
intervals (especially in countries where we benefit from a favorable regulatory framework whereby the
majority of prescription products are reimbursed by social security and healthcare insurance providers, as is
the case in France, our main market). For example, as of 2019, prescription glasses are replaced on an
estimated average of 3.9 years in Spain and 2.2 years in France, according to SWV. The rest of our sales
result from discretionary purchases, such as sunglasses and optical and hearing aid accessories. Even in
times of economic difficulty or pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), customers continue
to buy and order glasses while our stores (which are classified as "essential" businesses, reflecting the
healthcare-nature of the products we sell) remain open or will defer their purchase for only a short period of

1


-----

time. As a demonstration of this effect, after COVID-19-related confinement periods, we have observed a
rebound in sales, which generally outperform the same period in prior years, as customers catch up on
overdue purchases for prescription glasses, lenses or hearing aids.

Our business and sales volume has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but our business has shown
itself to be resilient. The classification of our stores as essential businesses has reinforced the importance
of opticians and audiologists during a severe public health crisis. We have taken several measures to adapt
to the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions while safely and effectively serving our
customers, including by implementing health and safety measures and changes to our commercial
operations, delivering continued customer care (even during strict confinement periods) and accelerating our
digital transformation and the development of our e-commerce platform. Despite the closure of some of our
stores located in large shopping malls (pursuant to local and national requirements), the decrease in sales
from these closed stores has been partially compensated by increased, redirected sales in other stores (for
example, in city centers) as customers shift their buying habits to buy or replace their prescription glasses
from another of our stores. In that regard, we have used our digital platform to assist customers, by expanding
and accelerating the transformation and the range of our online services we provide and which have been
heavily relied upon during the COVID-19 pandemic and related confinements, as evidenced by significant
expansion in the use of online appointments and redirection of customer traffic from closed to open stores,
as well as by making use of our customer relationship management system, which give us the ability to better
track customer behavior and forecast business and activities for our franchisees.

We operate in highly attractive markets that are differentiated from traditional retail markets due to the largely
non-discretionary and healthcare-related nature of optical and hearing aid expenses and a supportive
healthcare reimbursement system in France. We believe that both the optical product and hearing aid
markets are supported by positive structural drivers, including demographic trends, changing lifestyles,
technological innovations, product penetration dynamics and value-adding product add-ons.

In addition, our signature products are a key value differentiator, generating customer interest and good
margins for us and our franchisees. The success of our franchisee-centered business model is demonstrated
by the over-performance of our franchisees as compared to the wider market: average revenue per store in
our Alain Afflelou banner in France in 2019 was €0.9 million, which is approximately 1.6 times the retail
market average and approximately 4.0 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store
average, and average revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in Spain in 2019 was €0.4 million, which
is approximately 2.1 times the retail market average and approximately 4.8 times the independent retailer
store average, demonstrating the added value we offer to current and potential franchisees, which helps us
retain current and attract new franchisees.

Our strategy is based on strong branding, exclusive products, multi-possession, payment solutions and
positive customer experience, based on a multi-banner and multi-offer approach that reaches a variety of
price points and target customers. The Alain Afflelou umbrella brand is positioned as a generalist optical
product and hearing aid retailer and includes the highly recognizable "Alain Afflelou" optical banner as well
as the "Alain Afflelou Acousticien" hearing aid banner. We also operate in the discount activity through the
Optical Discount banner mainly in France. Our banners offer a wide range of optical and hearing aid
products, including our exclusive products, which consist of (i) signature label frames and sunglasses
bearing the "Afflelou" signature; (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses; and (iii) other exclusive
brands and third-party names.

We connect with and understand consumers in our markets through our communications and marketing
efforts, which have created a powerful and enduring brand image, as evidenced by our high brand awareness
with customers in our main markets. Among optical retailers, we ranked first in terms of spontaneous and
assisted awareness in France, first in terms of spontaneous awareness in Spain and first in assisted
awareness in Wallonia (Belgium), and ranked second in assisted brand awareness among hearing aid
retailers, according to various market studies conducted in 2018 and 2019. We also connect with consumers
via our online presence. We began developing our online presence in 2012 and have progressively been
incorporating our online initiatives under a unified digital umbrella. Currently we maintain websites in the
languages of the principal countries where our banners operate. Additionally, in September 2016, we
acquired two online pure players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com. We have incorporated the activities of
Happyview.fr into our French Afflelou website. Malentille.com continues to serve customers on its own
platform with back-end integration with the Group's online activities. We continue to explore ways to further
expand our online presence and e-commerce activities.

Our principal activity is to act as a franchisor, licensing the use of our brand and banners to franchisees and
providing them with the right to trade under one of our banners and implement our value proposition through
our commercial offers. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by (i) serving as
flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations; (ii) helping to test new concepts;
and (iii) facilitating store network management.

Our services as franchisor are aimed at helping franchisees grow their sales by fostering a strong brand
image, driving customers to our stores through the design and promotion of our commercial offers and
facilitating franchisee operations via a number of support services. Our scale and expertise yield tangible
benefits to our franchisees, allowing us to offer (i) commercial support and innovation through new
commercial offers and through high-impact national and local communication campaigns that create high
brand awareness; (ii) access to central listing and purchasing unit services that lower costs for our
franchisees; (iii) dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness, including assistance with location
selection and store design; (iv) training programs designed to enhance sales performance; and (v) other
general support functions, including legal, human resources and recruiting assistance, as well as assistance
with joining care networks in France.

Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our global network
of stores. We also provide suppliers with distribution services, including a central listing and payment unit
that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our franchisees, while offering the benefit of having a
single counterparty for commercial negotiations and payments. We also support suppliers by actively
promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directly-owned stores.

Our franchise model combines: (i) revenue based on network sales of our franchisees (24.6% of our revenue
in the six months ended January 31, 2021), (ii) revenue based on purchases (47.4% of our revenue in the
six months ended January 31, 2021) and (iii) revenue generated by sales to end-customers in our directlyowned stores (28.0% of our revenue in the six months ended January 31, 2021) and through our websites.
Revenue based on network sales includes, in particular: entry fees, franchise fees and communication fees,
as well as other fees charged for services that we provide to our franchisees. Revenue based on purchases
includes, in particular: trading as well as central listing and payment unit fees and licensing fees and revenue
from sales of our exclusive products. Revenue generated by our directly-owned stores mainly includes sales
made directly to end-customers in those directly-owned stores, as well as through our websites. This model
provides us with revenue diversification.

Our main costs are related to the supply and production of products that we sell under our own brands or for
which we have a license. For our exclusive frames, Okia, a company based in China, has long been our
favored intermediary. Okia is not a manufacturer but sources its products from a network of independent
factories in Asia and allows us to benefit from optimal production conditions through this unique commercial
relationship.

Our markets are attractive and growing, are differentiated from traditional retail markets by the largely nondiscretionary and healthcare-related nature of most of the optical and hearing aid products we sell, which
drives stability and predictability, and are underpinned by established structural growth dynamics, including
growing and aging populations that are expected to drive increased demand for both optical and hearing aid
products in coming years.

Consumers replace their glasses, contact lenses and hearing aids multiple times over their lifetime and for
a variety reasons, including for health reasons, such as changes in vision and hearing levels, as well as due
to loss, damage, improved technology and changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. These
factors drive stable replacement cycles: for example, as of 2019, the estimated average replacement cycle
for prescription glasses is 3.9 years in Spain and 2.2 years in France (as compared to 3.8 years and 2.4
years in 2012, respectively), according to SWV. As discussed further below in "—We sell essential
_healthcare-related products, most of which represent non-discretionary spending by our customers, making_
_our business resilient and predictable", most of our products are purchased because a customer has a_
medical need, which distinguishes these products from traditional retail and consumer goods and creates
relative resilience and predictability in our markets.

The market for optical products in our core markets is large: in 2020, 54% of the French population required
vision correction, according to SWV. These markets are also expanding as their populations age: SWV
estimates that, by 2025, 46.7% of the French population and 52.7% of the Spanish population will be over
the age of 45 and that 56% of each of the French population and 53% of the Spanish population will wear
prescription glasses (as compared to 54% and 52% in 2020, and 51%, respectively, and 48% in 2012,
respectively). Because eye and ear conditions, such as farsightedness and age-related hearing loss, usually
develop after the ages of 40 and 55, respectively, and generally become more common and serious with
age, the number of potential customers should increase as a consequence of the aging of the population in
the countries in which we operate, with similar tailwinds benefitting both optical products and hearing aids.

The optical product and hearing aid markets are also supported by other positive structural demographic
trends and other growth levers, including changing lifestyles, technological improvements and product
penetration dynamics. For example, we believe that evolving technology for corrective lenses and hearing
aids, particularly improvements in multi-focal lenses and increasingly small microphones leading to smaller
hearing aids, as well as shifting customer preferences as seen in increasing demand for custom lenses,
leads consumers to replace old equipment and should contribute to increased average basket sizes over the
mid- to long-term, which we expect to be further aided by favorable reimbursement dynamics in France, our
key market.

As a result of these factors, the French optical products market grew at a compound annual growth rate
("CAGR") of 1.2% over the 2015 to 2019 period, from €6.3 billion to €6.6 billion, declining to €6.0 billion in
2020, which we believe was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the one-off negative impact of
contraction driven by the 100% Santé changes, and is forecast to grow to €7.0 billion in 2025 (representing
a CAGR of 0.7% over the 2019 to 2025 period), the Spanish optical products market grew at a CAGR of
2.0% over the 2015 to 2019 period, from €1.8 billion to €1.9 billion, declining to €1.6 billion in 2020, which
we believe was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is forecast to grow to €2.1 billion in 2025
(representing a CAGR of 1.3% over the 2019 to 2025 period), in each case according to SWV, and the
French hearing aid market grew at a CAGR of 4.8% over the 2015 to 2019 period, from €1.2 billion to €1.5
billion, declining to €1.4 billion in 2020, which we believe was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and is forecast to grow to €2.0 billion in 2025 (representing a CAGR of 43.6% over the 2019 to 2025 period),
according to GfK and SNITEM. The chart below shows the evolution of the optical markets in France, Spain
and Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland and the hearing aid market in France for the calendar years
presented, as well as projections for 2025.

We are seeing strong indications of an acceleration in the hearing aid market, particularly in France. Hearing
aids have historically been an under-penetrated product class in our markets with only approximately 35%
to 40% of people in France who need hearing aids being equipped, due in large part to historically prohibitive
costs that have led patients to delay spending on the devices they need. We expect to see significant growth
in the hearing aid market in France in the coming years, resulting from at least the partial correction of this
historic under-penetration and further driven by the regulatory changes relating to RAC Zéro (the zero-cost
to consumer offer under French regulation for hearing aids (since January 2021)) that have come into effect
from January 2021, which make hearing aids significantly more affordable to those who need them. We
believe that many people who require hearing aids in order to help them achieve normal levels of hearing
have delayed these purchases due to the high cost of these products before the implementation of RAC
Zéro as well as specifically in anticipation of the implementation of the RAC Zéro scheme. We expect to
benefit from a "catchup effect" in hearing aid sales in the coming years as people become aware of and are
able to benefit from the RAC Zéro changes.

Xerfi forecasts that the French population will grow at a CAGR of 0.3% per annum from 2020 to 2025 and
forecasts that the population having hearing impairments will grow by 0.9% over the same period, mainly
due to the growth of the population of people aged over 65 being forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% over
the same period. The French hearing aid market is characterized by lower penetration rates (estimated to
be around 40% according to a 2018 EuroTrak study and may be as low as 35% according to Xerfi in 2020)
as compared to over 95% for the French optical market. Hearing loss is an increasingly common and
irreversible phenomenon that comes with aging and which is amplified by certain lifestyle choices, such as
living in noisy environments or excessive use of headphones. The prevalence of hearing loss is positively
correlated with the increasing population of people aged 65 and older (which is expected to grow from 20.5%
in 2020 to 22.1% in 2025), as well as with increasing levels of noise pollution. It is estimated that more than
a quarter of the population of people aged 65 and over have some degree of hearing loss. The recent

4


-----

changes brought by 100% Santé are expected to increase the use of hearing aids. Xerfi estimates that the
total population of people in France with a hearing impairment to be 6.9 million people in 2020, with only
40% being equipped, according to a 2018 EuroTrak study. Driven by the 100% Santé changes, Xerfi
estimates that the proportion of people equipped will grow to 43% (3.1 million people) by 2025.

**_We sell essential healthcare-related products, most of which represent non-discretionary spending_**
**_by our customers, making our business resilient and predictable_**

The healthcare-related nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that may, at
best, be sometimes delayed but rarely deferred completely. Most of our products are purchased because a
customer has a medical need: for the six months ended January 31, 2021, 93% of our sales were generated
on sales of glasses (86%) or hearing aids (7%) that were purchased with a prescription. According to 2020
data from Gallileo, 83% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing new glasses was due to need,
as compared to 16% who indicated it was based on personal, non-health-related preference and, according
to 2020 data from Arcane, 89% of customers surveyed indicated that their last eyewear purchase was for
prescription glasses. These dynamics create resilience and predictability in our markets.

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered strong indications of this resilience: the rebound of our networks
following the initial emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 14.3% year-on-year growth in like-for-like
network sales in the three months ended October 31, 2020, 10.0% year-on-year growth in like-for-like
network sales in the six months ended January 31, 2021 and 25.1% year-on-year growth in Adjusted EBITDA
in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (9.9% in the first half of the current fiscal year) demonstrates the
largely non-discretionary nature of most of our products, as does year-on-year growth of 26.3% in like-forlike network sales in the six months ended January 31, 2021 in our hearing activity. We believe that even
when certain of our stores have been closed due to COVID-19-related restrictions, the net result was that
many purchases were either merely redirected to other stores in our network, rather than not being made or
being deferred over the long-term, or were merely delayed until our stores reopened. As evidence of the
latter, we observe a "catchup" effect whereby, when our stores reopen after COVID-19-related closures, we
often see customers making purchases that they had been planning or waiting to make during such closures.

Additionally, measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 have evolved favorably for our industry in
our core geographies. For example, since the second confinement in France, which began in November
2020, the sale of optical and hearing aid products has been deemed an "essential" service, in recognition of
the non-discretionary healthcare needs addressed by these items, which has generally allowed our stores
to remain open (where not otherwise limited by other restrictions that are not specific to the optical and
hearing aid sectors, such as those currently in place for large shopping centers in France). This represents
a significantly improved operating environment for our industry, as compared to the more restrictive and
exceptional confinement measures imposed in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in
the spring of 2020, when our stores were generally limited to providing "emergency" services.

Finally, we believe that our franchisees have weathered the COVID-19 pandemic well overall. For example,
we are observing that few of our franchisees are continuing to request payment deferrals in connection with
COVID-19-related financial challenges and most are in the process of paying back previously-requested
deferrals, which we believe is an indicator of their financial stability.

**_We benefit from a highly-developed and supportive reimbursement system for healthcare-related_**
**_products in our core French market_**

Regulatory dynamics in France have historically been favorable to our business, as well as being stable over
the long-term, which has further driven resilience and predictability in our French business. In addition, we
believe that recent regulatory changes will be, on the whole, neutral for our optical business and beneficial
for our hearing aids business.

For our business, the key benefit of the French health insurance reimbursement framework is that it has the
overall effect of reducing the price sensitivity of our customers and coverage by the private segment of this
framework is nearly total: in 2020, approximately 99% of the French population was covered by a private
health insurance plan or CMU, according to Gallileo. While the French _public health insurance system_
reimburses only approximately 4% of customers' optical expenses, the policies of French _private health_
insurance companies (organismes complémentaires d'assurance maladie, known as "OCAMs") generally
reimbursed at least 70% of such expenses in 2020, according to Gallileo.
The 100% Santé regulatory changes, including the RAC Zéro offer, have had the further effect of reducing
customer price sensitivity as well as reducing out-of-pocket customer costs for both optical and hearing aid
products, which we believe will drive sales going forward, particularly for our hearing aid products. With the
full impact of RAC Zéro taking effect from January 2021, customers can now purchase hearing aids at zero
out-of-pocket cost (as is already the case for optical products). According to a 2018 EuroTrak customer
survey, people wait an average of three years between becoming aware of their hearing loss and purchasing
hearing aids, while hearing aids are used for an average of six years before being replaced. We expect the

5


-----

long-term impact of RAC Zéro to include motivating customers who previously deferred hearing aid
purchases to make such purchases, particularly for customers who were deferring such purchases in
anticipation of the RAC Zéro changes coming into effect.
**_We are a deeply-entrenched optical and hearing aid market leader that benefits from high brand_**
**_awareness_**

We are a well-known and trusted leader in the optical and hearing aid markets in which we operate. The
Alain Afflelou umbrella brand is positioned as a generalist optical and hearing aid retailer and includes our
deeply-entrenched "Alain Afflelou" optical banner and our "Alain Afflelou Acousticien" hearing aid banner.

The Alain Afflelou banner benefits from high brand awareness across our main geographies, consistently
ranking #1 in spontaneous and assisted awareness for optical retailers in France (as measured by Arcane,
Galileo and Opinionway), as well as in Spain (as measured by Punto de Fuga), and #2 in French-speaking
regions of Belgium (as measured by CSA). We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain this marketleading brand awareness as these markets grow and evolve.

We regularly receive awards for our offering and our customer service. We have also won a number of
industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer service provider of the year by the Elu
_service client de l'année (ESCDA)_ market survey, conducted by Viseo Customer Insights, in France for five
years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021), "Óptica del año" by Inma Stratmarketing for best optician
in Spain in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, "best franchise in shopping centre" by the Asociación Española de
Centros Comerciales in 2018 and "foreign franchise with the best implantation in the Spanish market" by the
Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018, as well as for our television and video advertisements which
customers easily recall. Some of our franchisees also won the award of best hearing aid and optical
franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020 by the Fédération des Réseaux Européens de Partenariats et de
_Franchise (IREF)._

We have a long history of developing successful marketing and branding concepts, offers and products,
such as Tchin Tchin (second pair of glasses for €1, launched in 1999), NextYear (payment in installments
over 12 to 24 months, launched in 2009) and Magic (innovative glasses with magnetic clips, launched in
2017), which we believe help us grow and maintain our high levels of brand awareness and keep our brand
fresh and top of mind with new and potential customers. Where appropriate, we sometimes expand a brand
concept across our product offerings, as we did when we brought our Tchin Tchin concept to our hearing aid
banner in 2019.

**_We are a leading European franchisor, with a proven business model that is founded on long-_**
**_standing and strong relationships with franchisees and is positioned at the heart of the value chain_**

We are one of the leading franchisors in the European optical product and hearing aid markets, with over
forty years of experience partnering with our franchisees in our core markets (France and Spain) as well
countries that border our core markets (Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Portugal) and satellite
markets in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America, where we continue to grow strategically. Our
franchise business is our core activity: as of January 31, 2021, our franchised store network included 1,435
stores, which generated network sales of €428.8 million in the six months ended January 31, 2021. During
the same period and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we succeeded in opening 34 stores across our
network.

We have developed our successful franchise model, which has particular, historical strength in the optical
product sector, by combining the power of our brands with commercial innovations and close relationships
with franchisees and suppliers: we believe this model sets us apart from our competitors.

Since 2003, we have successfully taken this differentiated operating model, which we have developed and
refined with decades of experience in our core geographical and product markets, and rolled it out to other
countries, as seen by our success in building our networks in Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg,
in particular. We have historically had good results in rolling this model out in countries with French-speaking
populations but believe this model also works well in non-French speaking countries and regions, as shown
by the strength of our network in Spain. Since 2011 (save for 2013 to 2016, during which period LSFA
developed the hearing aid business in France outside of the Group), we have also rolled this model out in
the hearing aid markets in France and Spain, demonstrating that it works well across complementary product
groups as well as across strategically-selected geographies.

We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both revenue and number of
stores and the Alain Afflelou banner is the third-largest optical banner overall in terms of number of stores,
with a 10% market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) in a fragmented
market that has historically included many independent retailers (according to SWV).

In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network Spain, our second
core domestic market, where we had 336 stores as of January 31, 2021. In 2019, we operated the largest

6


-----

optical product franchise network in Spain in terms of number of stores) and were the fourth largest optical
retail chain, with a 7% market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales)
(according to SWV).

In the hearing aid market, under our Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner, we have grown faster than the market
average (57.4% over the 2016 to 2019 period, as compared to 9.3%, according to GfK) and held an
approximately 3% market share in France in 2020 (in terms of network sales). We operate Alain Afflelou
Acousticien with fundamentally the same sustainable business model as our successful Alain Afflelou
banner, including as to how contributions and fees are paid from franchisees. As a result, we believe that,
over the long-term, profit levels at Alain Afflelou Acousticien will eventually converge with and stabilize at
levels comparable to our Alain Afflelou banner.

Our business model is mature and well-developed, with a controlled fixed cost base such that, when sales
increase, we benefit from economies of scale that drive higher margins. In addition, our franchise model
combines multiple sources of revenue from both franchisees (comprising franchise fees (entry fees and
royalty fees) and communication fees, as well as wholesale activity revenue from the sale of exclusive ownbranded products and central purchasing unit revenue) and suppliers (comprising central listing and payment
fees and license royalties). This approach provides us with revenue diversification and attractive margins,
as demonstrated by our 23.4% and 28.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
revenue, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) for the twelve and six months ended January 31, 2021, respectively. We
also leverage our directly-owned store network to manage, support and develop our franchise business. Our
directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by serving as flagship locations in and around
Paris and other key strategic locations, helping to test new concepts and facilitating store network
management.

The success of our franchisee-centered business model is also demonstrated by the over-performance of
our franchisees as compared to the wider market: average revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in
France in 2019 was €0.9 million, which is approximately 1.6 times the retail market average and
approximately 4.0 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store average and average
revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in Spain in 2019 was €0.4 million, which is approximately 2.1
times the retail market average and approximately 4.8 times the independent retailer store average,
demonstrating the added value we offer to current and potential franchisees, which helps us retain current
and attract new franchisees.

The success of our business model is founded on our place at the center of the relationships among our
suppliers, franchisees and customers, which brings value to each of these groups. For example, our scale
and expertise generates multiple synergies and offers tangible benefits to our franchisees. For example, we
provide our franchisees with commercial support and innovation through new commercial offers, including
high-impact national and local advertising campaigns that create high brand awareness, access to central
purchasing unit services that lower their costs, dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness
(including assistance with location selection and store design), training programs designed to enhance sales
performance and other general support functions, including human resources, recruiting assistance and
financing assistance. Our signature products are another key value differentiator for our franchisees,
generating customer interest, with affordable products that offer good margins, which benefit our franchisees
as well as us.

We support our franchisees with long-term commitments to their success, as shown by how we help our
franchisees adapt to change, such as through our Adelante financial support program (which we believe is
a differentiator that few of our competitors are able to match), our Elite program (which is designed to assist
franchisees that are underperforming), assistance with store refurbishments and support for adding hearing
aid corners that make optical stores more attractive. We are also there to help our franchisees face
exceptional challenges: throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have supported our franchisees in a variety
of ways, including offering solutions that allowed them to defer an aggregate of €30 million in franchisee
payables, in addition to €15 million of bank loans that we guaranteed. Repayments on these deferred
amounts have been steady thus far and are expected to generate exceptional cash flows in the second half
of the current fiscal year.

Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our large store
network. We provide suppliers with distribution services, such as access to our central listing and payment
unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our large network of franchisees. We also centralize
payments from our networks to obtain optimal terms and facilitate credit management, to the benefit of these
suppliers. We further support suppliers by jointly developing and actively promoting their innovative products
to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directly-owned stores. We believe that this value-added
approach creates stable and reliable relationships with our suppliers, which in turn drives cost-efficiency for
us and makes us a more attractive partner to our franchisees.

**_Our multi-dimensional business model is data-driven, flexible and tailored to our customers' needs_**

We leverage our historical strength in the French and Spanish optical product markets and employ a
generalist concept that is primarily focused on city centers, while strategically diversifying our offering to
respond to changing dynamics in our markets. To that end, we have developed (i) a multi-channel concept
that is supported by the execution of a digital transformation plan that helps us tailor our customers'
experiences to their needs and preferences, while expanding our digital presence with "click-and-mortar"
functionality, (ii) multiple store formats that respond to varied customer preferences while actively managing
our store networks to adapt to evolutions in our markets and (iii) a complementary hearing aid business,
grounded in standalone franchised stores as well as value-additive hearing aid corners within existing optical
stores. We believe that this approach and these developments help us better serve our customers and our
franchisees and in turn makes us an attractive partner for our suppliers.

  - _Multi-channel, digital evolution of our business model_

In recent years, we have invested deeply in digital transformation focused on developing forward-thinking,
multi-format and fully-integrated customer relationship management ("CRM") tools, which make valuable
data available to us that help us understand our customers and tailor our offerings to meet and anticipate
their needs. We made investments of approximately €3.0 million in these tools in the six months ended
January 31, 2021. We are currently very well-equipped to gather and analyze data from our franchisees,
websites and directly-owned stores: most of our franchisees provide us with sell-out data, which we use to
understand customer behavior and to adjust our purchases based on evolutions in customer preferences.
We believe that we are well-positioned to pivot from the investment phase of our digital transformation and
CRM plan to a growth phase that puts this data to work for us and for our franchisees.

In our core markets, prescription healthcare-related products require in-store appointments and in-person
consultations with licensed opticians and audio prosthetists. As these in-person consultations cannot be
provided online, we believe our extensive store network in France and Spain provides us with a significant
advantage over disintermediated online retail platforms.

We also continue to develop our online tools to provide our customers with an integrated shopping
experience that is complementary to our store networks, to the benefit of our franchisees as well as us. Our
websites offer inspiration to our customers, who can browse, select and order frames online for delivery in a
store, where their glasses are fitted and lenses are mounted by our trusted professionals. By allocating
online-generated sales to specific stores, we increase store traffic and limit cannibalization, to the benefit of
our franchisees.

We are also increasingly promoting the use of online bookings for in-store appointments, which reduces wait
times, improves store efficiency and also helps to drive traffic into stores, with significant customer uptake
on this value-added service in past year. In January 2021, approximately 25,000 in-store appointments (21%
of total in-store appointments and a 15% increase from January 2020) were booked online, as compared to
approximately 200 in January 2020. This tool helps us to track and forecast flows in our business and to redirect traffic as needed, creating more predictability for our stores and letting us offer a more personal
experience to our customers.

In recent years, we have made successful acquisitions in the online space, with the purchase of Happyview.fr
and Malentille.com in 2016, and we continue to explore ways to continue to strategically expand our
presence in the online market for optical products and to acquire know-how to replicate across our existing
online platforms. We are present on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest,
YouTube and TikTok) and have developed apps and webtools that our customers can use to interact with
our product offering, for example allowing them to book appointments, track their contact lens replacement
cycle, to locate the nearest store or to virtually try on our frames. We are currently developing a
comprehensive approach for our digital business, in order to have a first-mover advantage in regards to
digital transformation, consistent with our historical marketing positioning, and in light of the fact that ecommerce penetration in our sector remains in its early stage.

  - _Multi-format business model, continuously adapted to meet the future_

We actively manage our store networks and store formats, using our expertise to identify changes in the
market and to adapt our store locations, formats and sizes to meet demand and emerging opportunities,
including through strategic relocations, adjustments to store sizes in city centers and development of larger
store formats outside city centers. In recent years, a growing share of our franchised stores have been
located in shopping centers and retail parks. While these locations have been impacted to a greater degree
than certain other store formats during the latter part of the COVID-19 dynamic, we are optimistic that we
will continue to be able to adapt our networks to meet customer demand going forward.

  - _Multi-offering approach, combining our historical optical business with a complementary hearing aid_
_offering that responds to anticipated growth in demand supported by a new, supportive healthcare_
_framework in France_

Since 2011 (save for 2013 to 2016, during which period LSFA developed the hearing aid business in France
outside of the Group), we have pursued a multi-offer strategy through the creation of our complementary
Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner in the French and Spanish hearing aid markets, as well as our Afflelou Sun
concept in France and Spain. We have modelled the Alain Afflelou Acousticien strategy on our successful
approach in the French and Spanish optical product markets, capitalizing on key success factors, such as
our experience as a large franchisor, our strong brand awareness, our disruptive, price-focused approach
and our history of commercial innovation, and leveraging our significant store network to develop crossselling opportunities and synergies, such as through the opening of hearing aid corners within optical stores,
and to expand our footprint in a cost efficient manner.

We believe the 100% Santé changes that took full effect in France from January 2021 will drive increased
penetration in the currently underpenetrated French hearing aid market, as these products are now
significantly more affordable for those who need them but are not yet equipped or those who may need to
replace their existing equipment. We believe our well-established Alain Afflelou banner is poised to capture
growth in this market in which we believe there is significant growth potential in the mid- to long-term.

**_We have a robust financial track record of high profitability, healthy cash generation and steady_**
**_deleveraging_**
Our business model, based on our highly-developed franchise business and asset-light, controlled fixed cost
base that requires limited working capital and capital expenditure, drives our stable, healthy and predictable
margins and cash generation. Before COVID-19, our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of network sales
was consistently above 10% and our free cash flow was consistently above 80%, in each case from the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2016 to the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2020 (pre-IFRS 16), while the ratio
of our third-party net debt to our Adjusted EBITDA declined steadily from 5.7x as of July 31, 2016 to 4.3x as
of January 31, 2020 (pre-IFRS 16). The table below presents our third-party net debt and leverage (pre-IFRS

As a franchisor, we have built an asset-light model that requires limited capital expenditure to expand our
networks, as almost all capital expenditures for the franchised stores in our networks are borne by our

10


-----

franchisees, who are responsible for their own store investments. From time to time, we support the
expansion of the network through our Adelante program, which assists our franchisees in raising bank
lending for expansions. We only bear the investment costs for our limited network of directly-owned stores,
which also helps us keep our capital expenditure needs relatively low: these needs generally correspond to
the maintenance of our directly-owned stores perimeter and the purchasing and selling of directly-owned
stores on behalf of franchisors.

Our financial performance is also bolstered by strong network sales, which grew in the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019, to €818.5 million, as compared to €781.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 and €752.6
million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. Despite the impact of COVID-19, we have still generated
strong network sales since the start of the pandemic, with network sales in the six months ended January
31, 2020 of €388.0 million, as compared to €401.9 million for the six months ended January 31, 2019, and
€428.8 million for the six months ended January 31, 2021. Our store count and network sales have benefited
from the acquisitions described above, as well as the strength and reputation of our franchise network, which
incentivizes franchisees to open new stores and expand our store network. This growth was evidenced by
an increase in our revenues and our ability to maintain Adjusted EBITDA margins above 20% for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), as well as a 23.4% and 28.4%
Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) for the
twelve and six months ended January 31, 2021, respectively. We believe that strong network sales
performance is a lever that can drive bottom-line improvement, particularly in our hearing aids business and
in our networks in countries that border our core markets, where we believe there is room to grow off the
back of economies of scale driven by our franchise model and fixed cost base, as network sales growth
generally requires limited capital expenditure.

The chart below presents the network sales for our Alain Afflelou France banner, our Alain Afflelou Spain
banner, our Alain Afflelou banner in Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland and our hearing aids business in
France and Spain for the 2015, 2019 and 2020 fiscal years.

_on July 31, 2016._
Additionally, we have historically achieved strong cash flow generation and attractive free cash flow
conversion dynamics, with a 78.0% free cash flow conversion rate for the six months ended January 31,
2021, as a result of our limited capital expenditure needs and working capital requirements. We also believe
there are significant profitability upside opportunities from operating leverage within our developing
businesses, such as our hearing aids business and our operations in countries that border our core markets.

We also have limited working capital requirements, supported by the soundness of our network and quality
of their payments. As noted above, we have provided financial assistance to our franchisees to help them
weather the COVID-19 pandemic. On the whole, franchisees have repaid amounts borrowed in short order
(with just €12.6 million of such COVID-19 loans to franchisees being outstanding as of January 31, 2021, as
compared to €25.7 million as of July 31, 2020) and repayments on these deferred amounts are expected to
generate exceptional cash flows in the second half of the current fiscal year of around €2 million per month).
Further, in our Alain Afflelou banner in France, a very limited number of stores have requested support or
have had difficulties satisfying their monthly payment obligations relating to our central payments structure
since the start of the current fiscal year, which we believe is an indicator of our franchisees' financial stability.

-----

We had a strong liquidity position of €117.4 million as of January 31, 2021 (as compared to €76.9 million at
July 31, 2020, showing how our liquidity has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic thus far).

These factors contribute to a robust record of cash generation, strong free cash flow, free cash flow
conversion and profitability. Our profitability combined with strong cash flow generation and limited capital
expenditures needs and working capital requirements have allowed us to reduce our leverage: the ratio of
our third-party net debt to our Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 5.7x as of July 31, 2016 to 4.6x as of January
31, 2019. Supported by our operational performance and cashflow generation, we have de-levered by 1.6x
since the 2017 refinancing, building cash on balance sheet to €117 million as of January 31, 2021. We will
be refinancing the Existing Notes, be fully paying down the PGE Loans and have €30 million available under
the New Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the Transactions, bringing the opening liquidity position
to approximately €41 million. Pro forma for the Transactions, our net secured debt ratio and our total net
debt ratio will be 3.8x and 5.2x, respectively, based on Normalized EBITDA of €104.1 million.

**_We are led by an experienced management team with a proven track record_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior management team. The Non-Executive
Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, Rachel Marouani, started her career in 1994 at Alain
Afflelou and in the following decades gained significant experience with Frantour, Accor Group and LVMH
Group. Rachel was CEO of FRED Jewelry from 2012 to 2017 and CEO of Make Up For Ever from 2017 to
2019. She has been awarded the French Government "Médaille nationale du mérite" for her contribution to
commerce. The members of our executive committee have an average of 12 years of experience with the
Group, and most have worked together as a team for many years and benefit from significant experience in
the retail, optical and hearing aid industries, in addition to having a thorough understanding of the regulatory
dynamics in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our management team has delivered significant operational
improvements in recent years and achieved consistent Adjusted EBITDA growth in recent years despite
evolving market conditions.

**Strategy**

Our strategy has six pillars: (i) increase our franchise network footprint in our domestic markets through new
store openings while continuing to optimize our efficiently-managed network and enhance our multi-channel
offering; (ii) achieve our digital transformation goals, (iii) drive organic growth through marketing innovation
and central support to franchisees; (iv) accelerate our expansion in the hearing aid markets with support in
France from the 100% Santé changes that are expected expand this market; (v) further penetrate the
European market in border countries and focus on network density and (vi) continue delivering operating
efficiencies at Group-level.

**_Increase our franchise network footprint in our domestic markets_**

We intend to further develop our network through new franchised store openings in our domestic markets
(France and Spain) within our Alain Afflelou banner, while continuing to optimize our network, including our
first price banner. We believe that there is still headroom to add to our Alain Afflelou networks in France and
Spain. We also believe we will be in a position to seize opportunities, both in terms of white space in the
retail space that has emerged since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and due to more independent
opticians being willing to join a larger banner. In past years, we have offered strong support to franchisees
in order to expand our network, such as our Adelante program in France and Spain, which facilitates the
opening and purchase of optical stores for new franchisees. We also believe there are also several avenues
for continued network optimization, including more actively managing our network and redeploying stores in
order to capture more consumer traffic.

**_Achieve our digital transformation goals_**

We intend to continue implementing our digital transformation, which is a process we accelerated during
2020, in part as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as through the shift to significant numbers of
online appointment bookings during 2020, which helps our franchisees to redirect customers and to carefully
observe relevant restriction measures.

Our digital transformation plan relies on a data-centric approach, in which we have made significant
investments and have achieved notable success in recent years. We have a large customer database and
have put in place strong support system from our franchisees and links with their point-of-sale systems,
which we believe helps us to offer better service to customers. We believe that continuing to implement our
digital transformation plan, including by optimizing our existing framework and rolling out new tools will help
us increase the loyalty of our existing clients and as well as to attract new clients. Part of our digital
transformation plan also involves the roll-out of digital screens, tablets and other innovative tools that are
aimed at improving the customer experience in the store. On the communication side, we also intend to
continue growing our presence on various social media platforms, as a growing part of our total
communication efforts. Finally, we intend to strengthen the multi-channel experience we offer to our

12


-----

customers. We currently have a "click-and-mortar" approach that encourages customers to explore and test
products online before ultimately buying products in one of our stores. Through our online offers at
Afflelou.com and Malentille.com, we also continue to serve customers online. As an example of this
approach, we opened our first fully digitalized store in Portal de l'Àngel, Barcelona in April 2021.

**_Drive organic growth through marketing, innovation and central support to franchisees_**

We intend to continue growing our store network by enhancing our brand image, including by promoting
awareness of our banners and commercial offers, remaining engaged with customers and potential
customers through innovative communications campaigns and further strengthening access to potential
customer pools by encouraging and assisting franchisees' accession to care networks in France. With
respect to our franchised store network, we will seek to maintain our strong framework of services and
support functions to enhance franchisee customer service and financial performance, including opening,
day-to-day and ad hoc support, such as through access to our central purchasing unit services, our expanded
_prêt-à-porter logistics platform and customer relations training programs that acquaint franchisees and their_
employees with the benefits of our latest commercial offers. We believe these services increase customer
satisfaction and improve performance in our stores, which are key drivers of our financial performance. We
will continue to extend a variety of services that we have put in place in recent years, like training (including
e-training) for our franchises and dedicated support (such as our Elite program, which is designed to assist
franchisees that are underperforming. Additionally, we intend to continue our rollout of a multi-offer approach,
converting existing franchisees into operators under both our optical and hearing aid banners, such as by
encouraging optical franchisees to add hearing aid or sunglasses corners in their stores. We believe that our
strong focus on cultivating and promoting our franchisee-centered business model will continue to support
robust levels of revenue per store in France and Spain, which have historically outperformed independent
retailers' levels of sales.

**_Accelerate further expansion in hearing aid products in all existing markets_**

We intend to continue our rapid expansion into the hearing aid market, with the aim of becoming a reference
brand in this market. In France, we benefit from the 100% Santé changes, which make hearing aids
significantly more affordable than they were previously and than they are in many other markets. In addition
to benefitting from strong intrinsic growth in the market, driven by an aging and growing population, coupled
with relatively low equipment penetration rates which are expected to increase the population of hearing aid
wearers at a CAGR of 5% over the 2020 to 2025 period, and a supportive healthcare reimbursement system
in France, we believe there is further growth potential in our existing countries of operation.

Our strategy in the hearing aids business is based on synergies with our historical optical business. On one
hand, our combined offering provides consumers with the convenience of acquiring both products at a single
location, based on the fact that there is substantial overlap in the population seeking vision correction and
the population seeking hearing aids. On the other hand, opticians and hearing aid specialists in our network
benefit both from these synergies, with opticians welcoming new potential clients under the hearing aids
offers, while hearing aid specialists benefit from premium locations inside our optical network. Additionally,
we believe that our strong brand equity will benefit from the growth of each banner.

Our hearing aid corners are a key growth lever for us, as we believe the hearing aid market is well-poised
for significant growth, particularly in France following the implementation of 100% Santé in January 2021
and also that we are well-positioned to benefit from this growth as the hearing aid business is complementary
to and synergistic with our historical optical business and we already have a significant footprint of hearing
aid points of sale in our core markets. We believe there is significant upside to putting hearing aid corners in
our franchisees' existing optical stores, as the two businesses are complementary and we believe that these
hearing aid corners drive like-for-like growth in sales of frames and lenses/glasses. Our model envisions
franchisees operating their dedicated optical stores alongside two to three corners. We believe this approach
is a natural fit for many of our franchisees, particularly for those who are dually-qualified as opticians and
audiologists, as well as for those who see a natural way to expand their existing competency to cover
audiology as well as optical services. Finally, we believe that using the same model in our hearing aid
business as we do in our optical business will generate economies of scale in the future and help us to
generate favorable levels of profitability.

**_Further penetrate the European market in border countries and continue to expand in other_**
**_international areas_**

We have a well-established and expanding presence in countries that are adjacent to our core markets of
France and Spain, having successfully expanded our Alain Afflelou banner into Belgium (1995), Luxembourg
(2002), Switzerland (2005) and Portugal (2008). We believe that these "border" markets collectively
represent millions of potential end-customers and thus present a significant potential growth opportunity for
us, as these are familiar markets to us where we already have a fairly mature base, where we can roll-out
the same operating model we use in France and Spain and where we benefit from built-in brand awareness.

13


-----

We intend to further extend our European footprint in these border countries (i.e. Belgium, Luxembourg,
Switzerland and Portugal) by deepening our franchise network. In both Belgium and Switzerland, we are
mainly present in French-speaking regions and we are increasing our presence in Flemish-speaking regions
of Belgium and the German-speaking regions of Switzerland. In Portugal, we are currently reviewing our
strategy to expand beyond our existing base. We continuously evaluate potential targets for strategic
acquisitions, particularly in such border countries.

We also believe there are opportunities in the Middle East, where we see room to grow, as well as in Africa,
where there is an increasing middle class, as well as a growing population with more disposable income,
and especially in African countries that have a historical link with France. We believe that our franchise model
adapts well to various geographies, languages and types of markets. Our international roll-out expansion in
those new geographies rests on limited costs and risk strategy, with a model operating through master
franchise agreements, where potential is limited.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies at Group-level_**

We intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our network organization by
streamlining our administrative and overhead functions and controlling our cost base, for instance by
regrouping our various administrative locations in France at one site in Paris. In our Alain Afflelou banner,
we intend to continue evaluating the performance of our store network, with a view to optimizing such
performance. We will also continue to carefully monitor our directly-owned stores network, with a long-term
target of maintaining a limited directly-owned stores perimeter, while acting opportunistically where we
believe there is low-risk potential, in particular opportunities that are created by the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on retail space. We plan to continue to leverage our directly-owned stores in managing our wider
network, operating flagship stores, and in negotiations with suppliers.

We also intend to continue our advertising efforts to support the development of our network, while leveraging
our economies of scale. In particular, we believe that the rapid growth of our hearing aid banner will generate
a benefit to the brand equity of the overall Alain Afflelou banner. In addition, we intend to continue leveraging
our long-standing relationships with suppliers to obtain the most favorable commercial terms for our store
network. More generally, the expansion of our network, together with the implementation of dedicated central
purchasing units, has reinforced our purchasing power and our ability to negotiate discounts and rebates
with suppliers. Savings generated from these discounts or rebates are shared with franchisees. Finally, we
believe that expanding in border countries and growing our hearing aids business will help us increase
profitability, due to both gains in communication margins and the growth of exclusive products.

**Recent Developments**

**_Recent developments related to the global COVID-19 pandemic_**

_Impacts on and risks to Afflelou from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic_

In late 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China. This novel strain of
coronavirus can cause an illness which is referred to herein as "COVID-19". This coronavirus strain has
spread widely, triggering a global pandemic that has affected most countries and which has had significant
public health and economic impacts in France and Spain.

On March 15, 2020, the French government ordered all but certain essential businesses be closed and
imposed significant limitations on the circulation of the general population. The Spanish government also
implemented similar measures in March 2020. Such measures are generally referred to herein as

15


-----

"confinement" and "confinements". In the context of these governmental orders, we temporarily closed
all of our directly-owned stores in the main European countries in which we operate and we advised our
franchisees to do the same. Consequently, since mid-March 2020, our business has been impacted by
the COVID-19 pandemic, due in large part to the significant impact the pandemic has had on day-to-day
life in our key geographies (France, Spain, Belgium and Switzerland).

The main consequence of the pandemic and the related confinement measures on our business was the
closure of a vast majority of the stores in our network from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020,
resulting in a sharp decline in sales to near zero during that period. However, Afflelou is characterized by
its healthcare offering to clients with more than 90% of Afflelou's sales in France and Spain being
generated from prescription glasses and hearing aids. Because the healthcare products we sell are
essential to our customers, customers generally only postpone the purchase of these products for a
limited period of time, as indicated by a customer survey by Galileo showing that 83% of customers
change glasses for non-discretionary reasons, such as a change in vision impairment or breakage. As
the countries in which we operate concluded their initial confinement periods, the period of sharp decline
due to temporary, required store closures was followed by the reopening of our store network, leading to
a rebound in sales. As a result, our sales for the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021 were
significantly above sales for the same period in the prior year, outlining the healthcare and nondiscretionary nature of the optical and hearing aid products we sell.

In addition, one direct consequence of the first confinement was increased online sales through our
websites (OpticalDiscount.com, _malentille.com_ and _Afflelou.com). Online sales in April 2020 roughly_
doubled as compared with April 2019, but were still limited overall and mostly linked to contact lenses, on
which competition is price-oriented. Since then, online sales continued to perform at a level above that of
the year before.

In late autumn 2020, due to a rapid resurgence of COVID-19 in our main geographies, new restrictive
measures were again imposed by governments, including curfews, local confinements and closures of
specific areas, such as certain indoor shopping centers based on square footage thresholds. These
restrictions have not thus far been systematically applied to the optical or hearing aid sectors, which are
deemed "essential businesses" and which allows us to keep our stores open. However, these restrictive
measures have had a limited negative impact on our sales in the first half of the current fiscal year. More
recently, store closures in selected indoor shopping centers in France, due to a combination of factors,
including reduced traffic and trading hours, affected 119 Alain Afflelou optical stores in February 2021
and approximately 150 stores from March 6, 2021, although some of the lost activity in these stores was
redirected to stores that remained open, notably in city centers. On average, stores open in February
2021 saw an increase in activity of more than 15% as compared to February 2019.

_Confinement from mid-March 2020 to mid-May 2020 - Measures taken by the Group_

Health and safety measures taken by the Group

Since mid-March 2020, we have rapidly taken measures to safeguard the health of our employees and
customers and have granted support to members of our networks to assist them with taking precautionary
and protective measures. The most significant measure was the closure of all of our directly-owned stores
during the first confinement period. We also put in place teleworking arrangements for the staff and
personnel in our headquarters from March 16, 2020. At the end of March 2020, we ordered 1,000,000
masks, of which approximately 500,000 were donated to the French National Health Authority. The
remainder of the order was delivered to franchisees, together with other personal protective equipment,
such as visors, hand sanitizers and protective gloves, in advance of the reopening of the store network.

Adaptation of the Group's operations to confinement

We have also taken measures to adapt our structure to the confinement period, including taking cost
reduction measures and using temporary layoffs where possible. As a consequence, personnel costs in
France and Spain during the confinement period (March 16 to May 11, 2020) were reduced by
approximately half of normative levels. We also closely monitored and reviewed other operating charges
during the first (and each subsequent) confinement period.

Customer care during and after confinement

During the first confinement, our network implemented a scheme for emergency services for customers
in a limited number of stores across our main geographic markets. In preparation for the reopening of the
store network, we implemented procedures to facilitate safe store activity. Health measures have been
taken to protect both employees and customers, with strict protocols implemented at store-level, including
limits on the number of people in a store at one time, strict protocol for handling and sanitizing
merchandise, frequent sterilization of tools, increased attention to hygiene and increasing use of
appointments for store visits by customers.

16


-----

Financial support to the store network during and after confinement

As a reminder, we pay our listed suppliers through our central listing structure each month, on behalf of
the franchisees who purchase the products sold to end customers via the store network. Those franchisee
orders, together with the services and exclusive products invoiced by us to the franchisees, represent
flows of more than half of franchisee sales every month. Thanks to the sales terms we offer to franchisees,
the latter make payments for purchases to the central listing structure two months after such purchases
are made and thus have limited working capital requirements. As a consequence of the confinement,
there were virtually no sales from mid-March to mid-May 2020, which created a significant need for cash
at the franchisee-level in order to make payments to us for products and services invoiced for January
and February of this year. In addition to advising franchisees about specific measures to secure their
business (such as negotiating rent reductions, payment deferrals, temporary layoffs, tax deferrals and
loan standstills), we took various measures to support the financial health of the store network by reducing
monthly instalments in March, April and May (for a total amount of more than €30 million) and through
loans granted by banks and guaranteed by us (for a total approximate amount of €15 million, of which
approximately 450 loans of €20,000 were granted by our partner in the NextYear offer). Our franchisees
have negotiated or are currently negotiating certain government-backed loans, in France with a state
guaranteed loan (Prêt Garanti par l'Etat or PGE) and in Spain with the support of the Instituto de Crédito
_Oficial, for a total approximate amount of €15 million. Thanks to strong sales recovery since June, and_
the financial measures described above, almost all our franchisees were able to start repaying the
postponed amounts. The outstanding amounts on deferred payments of our franchisees were €12.6
million as of January 31, 2021, with repayment expected to be complete before the end of the fiscal year
ending July 31, 2021. This will represent an exceptional cash inflow.

Acceleration of our digital transformation

In addition to the increased level of online sales (particularly contact lenses) in order to adapt to the more
constrained conditions in which we can welcome customers into our stores (as described above), we are
promoting the use of appointments for store visits. This is not a major departure in terms of process for
people who are accustomed to booking appointments, as is already the case for appointments with
opticians in Spain and hearing aid specialists in France. However, at present, there is limited use of
appointments in the French optical sector, due to the small proportion of glasses wearers who request
view exams in optical stores. In connection with 100% Santé (as described above) changes, we believe
the proportion of eye exams in optical stores will grow in the future, which should favor appointments to
reduce wait times for customers and improve customer flow through our stores. Customers booked
approximately 100,000 store appointments in May 2020 alone, a significant increase in the proportion of
customers using this service. Store appointments are part of the customer journey targeted in our digital
transformation plan and also help us forge closer links with our customers.

Impact of the pandemic and confinement on the Group's liquidity

Our cash position at the end of January 2020 was €58.2 million. In light of the rapid spread of the COVID19 pandemic in France and Spain and the related economic uncertainty, we decided at the beginning of
March 2020 as a precautionary measure to draw on our Existing Revolving Credit Facility in an amount
of €30 million. In mid-April 2020, considering a longer than expected confinement period, we decided to
negotiate a €30 million French government-backed loan (the "PGE", as described further above). The
PGE was obtained and drawn in July 2020, while we decided not to renew our March 2020 precautionary
drawdown on the Existing Revolving Credit Facility.

Our store network after the initial confinement

In the quarter ended January 31, 2021, most of our stores were open following the initial confinement,
but traffic in our stores continued to be affected by COVID-19, especially in stores that are located in
malls. This included reduced traffic by visitors who come to discover our sunglasses collection and buy
sunglasses, contact lenses and care products. On the other hand, the transformation rate of visits into
sales by potential glasses buyers is generally high: studies point to customers asking for, on average,
less than two quotes from opticians for any purchase of glasses. Thus, we believe that, while traffic is still
reduced in certain areas, such as malls, visits by customers seeking to purchase glasses generally have
a higher transformation rate. We believe that a temporary lack of traffic in our stores linked to visitors
looking for sunglasses and contact lenses will have a limited impact (such products typically represent a
proportion of less than 15% of our network's optical sales in France), as long as it does not affect store
visits by customers seeking prescription glasses. As noted above, we have observed a better
transformation of visits into sales of glasses, due to the increasing use of appointments.

Reopening of the Group's stores after initial confinement

We believe that the level of sales following the initial confinement significantly benefitted from
"pent-up" demand. After the lifting of the initial confinement measures, our sales began to rebound
quickly. The activity of our main geographical banners returned to positive sales performance in June
2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, for the remaining period of the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020. Since then, sales continued to show positive trends with a strong improvement of sales in each
geographical area, versus the year before, in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021. In
the first quarter of the current fiscal year as a result of the catch-up effect from customers having to
compensate for having not been able to purchase eyewear and hearing aids during the initial confinement
period, network sales were €219.5 million (a 14.7% year-on-year increase), Adjusted EBITDA was €26.2
million (a 25.1% year-on-year increase) and Adjusted EBITDA in our France segment increased by 29.8
% in the first quarter of the current fiscal year as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

_November 2020 to mid-December - Return to confinement measures after the spread of a second wave of_
_the pandemic_

In our main geographical areas, a second wave of the pandemic emerged in mid-September 2020, with a
strong acceleration in October. In order to face this resurgence of COVID-19, governments and local
administrations adopted new responsive measures and put in place a curfew in October in our main
geographical areas and subsequently adopted a second period of confinement from early November to
mid-December 2020. In France, Spain and Belgium, the measures included restrictions on movement,
encouragement for teleworking, and the temporary closure of any "non-essential" retail activity.

Given the critical, healthcare nature of optical and hearing aid products, optical and hearing aid retailers
were deemed "essential" to the population and were allowed to remain open throughout the second
confinement. In this context, we decided to keep our stores open, and encouraged franchisees to do so
as well, in line with the sector union recommendation in France. Customers were contacted through SMS
and emails and prompted to book appointments with their opticians. During this second confinement
period, almost all of our stores were open in our main geographies and the impact of this second
confinement on our network sales was relatively limited.

As of mid-December 2020, sales in our network continued to show normal activity as compared with the
same period in 2019, on the whole.

_Current partial restrictions - New restrictive measures taken since the beginning of 2021 and evolution of_
_the pandemic in our main geographical areas (France and Spain)_

In France, due to the persistence of a large number of new infections in the population, the appearance
of coronavirus variants and ongoing pressure on the health system, combined with a slow rollout of
vaccinations (with 5.3 million people vaccinated at mid-March 2021), the government made the decision
to put in place a new nighttime curfew that begins at 18:00 every day (19:00 from March 20), which has
been in effect since mid-January 2021. In addition, the government has been enforcing closures of
shopping centers of over 20,000 square meters nationwide since January 31, 2021 and of shopping
centers of over 10,000 square meters nationwide since March 6, 2021. For the month of February 2021,
the first wave of closures in French shopping centers impacted 130 of our stores, of which 119 are Alain
Afflelou optical stores, representing around 17% of total network sales (in France, as measured on the
basis of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, our last full-year results pre-COVID-19). These current partial
restrictions, which commenced across 16 French departments (out of 96 in the metropolitan territory),
including the Ile-de-France, on March 20, 2021, were extended to the whole French territory on April 3,
2021, and are planned to last four weeks, and will allow, as in November, essential businesses to remain
open, apart from those in shopping centers already closed. The new restrictive measures in smaller
shopping centers increased the number of our stores which must be closed by approximately 35 stores to
approximately 165, of which approximately 150 were Alain Afflelou optical stores, (representing
approximately 20% of our total network sales, as measured on the basis of the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019, our last full-year results pre-COVID-19). However, in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, the
impact of these temporary store closures in France was mitigated by an outperformance of approximately
20% that we observed in French stores which remained open, due to a combination of redirection of sales
from closed stores in shopping centers to stores that have remained open and a continued rebound effect
following prior COVID-19 temporary closures. On April 29, the French administration announced a
calendar for the progressive easing of the partial restrictions that have been in place since mid-January.
Pursuant to this calendar, we expect to be able to reopen our currently closed stores on May 19, 2021,
barring further adjustments made to this timing at a national or local level. In Spain, consumer activities
generally are subject to lighter restrictions as compared to France.

**_Recent developments related to changes in the regulatory environment_**

In January 2018, the French government began a consultation process with various unions and
representatives from the optical, hearing aid and dental care sectors. The consultation process was
undertaken in connection with the French Health Ministry's intention to improve access to and reduce
costs of healthcare services for end consumers. The medium-term objective of this process is to ensure
that, by 2021, consumers bear no out-of-pocket costs for certain health- related products, including
glasses and hearing aids. The measures, which are known as "100% Santé", were confirmed in June
2018 and create two segments of such health-related products: Segment A (in the optical sector) /
Segment I (in the hearing aid sector), which are to be offered at zero cost to the consumer, and Segment
B (in the optical sector) / Segment II (in the hearing aid sector), which are to be offered at free market
rates.

In the optical sector, the main aspects of the 100% Santé measures are (in effect since January 2020):

  - a zero consumer cost (reste à charge or RAC zéro) offer, which consists of a basic "basket" for
glasses (for glasses with anti-reflective thin lenses, set at around €100 and €195, respectively,
for unifocal and the most common multifocal glasses). All opticians must make this offer available
to end customers, offering a minimum range of 17 frames. Every quote to customers must include
a zero consumer cost offer. The basket for frames is set at a maximum of €30, with monofocal
lenses at around €70 and progressive lenses at around €165.

  - a reduction in the reimbursement cap by private health insurers, to €100 for frames (as compared
with €150 previously), as compared to an average basket for frames of approximately €130. For
reference, frames represented 25% of purchases in the market in 2020, according to GfK.

  - the possibility for the optician to perform view exams, reimbursed by Social Security, at
approximately €10, in order to facilitate the re-purchase of glasses with a prescription (with such
prescription being valid for five years).

In the hearing aid sector, the same discussions have also been conducted and the zero consumer cost
offer for hearing aids has been set more progressively, as the out-of-pocket cost of hearing aids is
currently approximately between €700 and €1,000, according to Arcane. The final phase of the 100%
Santé changes took effect from January 1, 2021. Segment I in the hearing aid segment now enables end
customers to get a hearing aid device valued up to €950 at no out of pocket cost. This RAC zéro offer is
expected to attract a large number of potential users of hearing aids, since the market is generally
considered to be significantly underequipped, with, for instance, a recent study by EuroTrak indicating
that only approximately 40% of French people with self-reported hearing loss actually use hearing aids.
We believe the 100% Santé changes that have taken effect since January 2021 will drive strong volume
growth in the French hearing aid market.

_100% Santé regulatory changes and assessment of their potential impact on the optical sector and the_
_AFFLELOU Group_

The above-described regulatory changes came into effect in January 2020 in the optical sector, and were
fully implemented in January 2021 in the hearing aid sector after two sets of changes in January 2019 and
January 2020.

In 2018, the Group engaged a consulting company to assess the potential impact of these changes. The
conclusions of this consulting company were a potential negative impact from these regulatory changes
of less than 2% in terms of total sector value (most of it due to the reimbursement cap by Social Security
set at €100 for frames):

changes around the zero consumer cost offer are expected to have a limited impact on the total market,
since low price offers below the zero consumer cost offer (mainly corresponding to Couverture Maladie
_Universelle ("CMU") were already available for approximately 8% of glasses buyers, while new glasses_
wearers (estimated to be less than one million people) who previously did not purchase glasses due to
high prices are expected to compensate for the negative impact of the downwards alignment of medium
to low price offers to the zero consumer cost offer.

_First results of the 100% Santé changes_

The start of calendar year 2020 was affected by delays by Social Security and private health insurers in
implementing the 100% Santé changes. The French health care systems struggled at first to take the new
classification codes of products into account, especially for lenses, thus making it difficult for opticians to
get the necessary information on reimbursement levels to end customers and, consequently, to invoice
end customers. As such, opticians were unable to invoice a large volume of end customers at the
beginning of calendar year 2020 and many end customers had to postpone their optical purchases. The
effect of this situation was progressively absorbed during the month of January 2020, with a limited
number of private health insurers still having difficulties serving end customers.

This situation resulted in a decline in January 2020 sales in the sector (21.5% as compared to January
2019 as estimated by l'Observatoire de l'Optique). This decline had a greater effect for large banners like
us, given that a larger proportion of end customers expect third-party payment and are generally more
sensitive to reimbursement levels than end customers of independent stores tend to be. However, the
effects of these changes were progressively absorbed in February 2020, and we have no reason to expect
further disruption in the future.

Due to the impact of COVID-19, the changes brought by 100% Santé are still difficult to analyze. A market
study conducted by Xerfi on the 100% Santé changes, including statistics up to September 2020, indicated
that 18% of people opted for Segment A glasses (either for both products, or frames or lenses only), which
is in line with our expectations. We have observed a proportion of 15% of our directly-owned stores clients

20


-----

opting for Segment A glasses. We note that the distribution by price of frames does not indicate a sharp
change in customer behavior. As a consequence, on the whole, we believe that the impact of 100% Santé
will not be substantially different from our expectations.

_100% Santé regulatory changes and assessment of their potential impact on the hearing aids sector_
_and the AFFLELOU Group_

The last phase of the 100% Santé changes took effect from January 2021 onwards, with the settlement
of a hearing aid base product price at €950, with no out of pocket expense for the end customers. Since
the 100% Santé changes were announced by the French government, we believe a significant number of
potential users of hearing aids chose to postpone their purchase until the new regulations came into effect
from January 2021 onwards. As a consequence, in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, total network
sales in our hearing aid banner have grown significantly (by more than 50%), despite the pandemic,
showing a strong acceleration, including a rapid rise relating the RAC zéro offer.

**_Current Trading_**
Since mid-January 2021, in response to a third wave of COVID-19 cases, the French government has
implemented new partial restrictions on movement, including a nightly curfew in many regions (initially set
at 18:00 and which was revised to 19:00 in March), and the temporary closure of certain retail locations,
mainly in shopping centers of over 20,000 square meters starting February 2021 and over 10,000 square
meters since March 6, 2021. which resulted in the temporary closure of approximately 130 of our stores
since February 2021. The new restrictive measures in smaller shopping centers increased the number of
our stores which must be closed by approximately 35 stores to approximately 165, of which approximately
150 were Alain Afflelou optical stores, (representing approximately 20% of our total network sales, as
measured on the basis of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, our last full-year results pre-COVID-19).

However, we believe that the financial impact of the closure of these stores in France has been partially
mitigated by a positive evolution of approximately 20% in in the third quarter of the current fiscal year as
compared to the same period in calendar year 2019 in sales at our stores that have remained open. We
also believe this redirection of sales to our stores that remain open is another demonstration of the nondiscretionary, healthcare-related nature of our business. In addition, following the launch of 100% Santé
in France in January 2021, we continue to see significant growth in our hearing aids activity's total sales,
which grew by more than 50% in the third quarter of the current fiscal year, as compared to the same
period in fiscal year 2019, while other areas evolved positively during the same period. As a result, we
estimate that for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, group network sales were
approximately 5% below the same period in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. We anticipate that, after
the re-opening of the closed stores and the return to normal activity in our networks, we should benefit
from a catchup effect from pent-up demand accumulated since the first confinement in Spring 2020.

**Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data**

The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial information of the Issuer as well as
certain operating data. The summary historical consolidated financial information in the tables below is
derived from the Issuer's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020 prepared in accordance with IFRS and from the Issuer's unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January 31, 2021, which include the unaudited
comparative financial information for the six months ended January 31, 2020, prepared in accordance with
IAS 34, the standard of IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 were subject
to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Constantin Associés (member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu
Limited), the Issuer's statutory auditors for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The Issuer's audited
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2020 were subject to an audit
by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer's statutory auditors for those years. The
Issuer's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January
31, 2021, which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the six months ended January
31, 2020, were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer's
statutory auditors for such period. For the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer for the fiscal years
ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, an English translation of the consolidated financial statements and a
free English translation of the auditors' reports are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. For the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January 31, 2021,
the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the related auditor's report are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The statutory auditors' report of Constantin Associés (member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited) and
Ernst & Young et Autres on the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2018, without modifying the audit opinion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter relating to Note
3.1 to the consolidated financial statements relating to the impact of the revenue recognition standard, IFRS
15, "Revenue from contracts with customers", adopted early by the Issuer as of August 1, 2017. The statutory
auditors' report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés on the audited consolidated financial
statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, without modifying the audit opinion expressed therein,
contains an emphasis of matter drawing attention to the uncertainty related to the tax adjustments received
from the tax authorities concerning tax loss carryforwards described in note 6.6.3 "Notifications, lawsuits and
disputes" to the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditors' report of Ernst & Young et Autres
and Deloitte & Associés on the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020, without modifying the audit opinion expressed therein, contains emphases of matter drawing attention
to the matters disclosed in note 4.1.1 "standards, amendments and interpretations as of August 1, 2019" to
the consolidated financial statements relating the impact of the mandatory implementation of IFRS 16
"Leases" by August 1, 2019 and note 6.6.3 "Notification, lawsuits and disputes" to the consolidated financial
statements which present the uncertainty related to the tax adjustments received from the tax authorities
concerning tax loss carryforwards. The review report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés on
the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January 31,
2021, without modifying the conclusion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter drawing attention
to the matter disclosed in note 6.3.2, which describes lawsuits, disputes and related uncertainties.

In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil
discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in implementing the various components of the
franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the Optimil
banner and focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a potential sale
of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018 and the disposal was completed at the
end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were treated as discontinued
operations in the income statement of our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended
July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were not treated as discontinued operations
in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

The unaudited financial information of the Issuer for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2021 was
calculated by adding the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information for the six months
ended January 31, 2021 extracted from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements
as of and for the six-month period ended January 31, 2021, to the audited consolidated financial information
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 extracted from the audited consolidated financial statements as of
and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, and subtracting the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial information for the six months ended January 31, 2020 extracted from the unaudited comparative

financial information for the six-month period ended January 31, 2020 included in the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the six-month period ended January 31, 2021.

The following tables should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information", "Use of Proceeds", "Capitalization", "Management's Discussion and_
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the Issuer's consolidated financial statements_
and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were not treated as discontinued operations
in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

(1) "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as operating income from ordinary activities (excluding non-recurring items and the impact on
income from discontinued operations) as presented in the Issuer's consolidated financial statements, before (i) depreciation and
amortization of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets and right-of-use assets, (ii) changes in provisions for trade
receivables and inventories and provisions for depreciation of right-of-use assets on property, plant and equipment and (iii) the
management fees and bonuses payable to management. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial
_Measures". The following table sets forth a reconciliation of operating income from ordinary activities to Adjusted EBITDA for the_
periods indicated.

(2) "Adjusted EBITDA margin" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

(3) "Net interest expense" is defined as gross borrowing costs less capitalized interest expense less accrued but unpaid interest. For
a full breakdown of its constituent components, see note 6.1.7 to the Issuer's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019 and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and note 3.1 to the Issuer's consolidated financial statements as
of and for the six months ended January 31, 2021 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

(4) "Third-party gross debt" refers to total borrowings and other financial liabilities not taking into account the IFRS impact of
capitalized issuance costs but including accrued interest minus total Shareholder Bonds and net of sublease liabilities.

(5) "Third-party net debt" refers to third-party gross debt including accrued interest minus cash and cash equivalents as appearing
on our balance sheet.

(6) "Net capital expenditure" refers to (i) purchases of intangible assets, (ii) purchases of property, plant and equipment and (iii)
proceeds from disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.

(7) "Free cash flow" is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid. Free cash flow is not
a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of financial
position as determined in accordance with IFRS. Free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used
by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the
Issuer’s cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS.

(8) "Free cash flow conversion" is defined as (x) Adjusted EBITDA minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid divided
by (y) Adjusted EBITDA. Free cash flow conversion is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be
considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS. Free cash flow
conversion is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not
consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the Issuer’s cash flows as determined in accordance with
IFRS.

(9) "As adjusted **third-party gross debt" is defined as third-party gross debt as of January 31, 2021 as adjusted for the Transactions.**

(10) "As adjusted cash and cash equivalents" is defined as cash and cash equivalents of the Issuer after adjustments to give effect
to the Transactions as further described in footnote 1 under "Capitalization".

(11) "As adjusted **third-party net debt" is defined as As adjusted third-party gross debt less As adjusted cash and cash equivalents**
as of January 31, 2021.

(12) "As adjusted net interest expense" represents net interest expense of the Issuer on third-party gross debt for the twelve months
ended January 31, 2021, as though the Transactions had occurred on February 1, 2020. As adjusted net interest expense has
been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to be what our interest expense would have actually been had
the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project the Issuer's interest expense for any future period
or the Issuer's financial condition at any future date. As adjusted net interest expense excludes charges allocated to debt issuance
costs.

Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019[(13)] ................................................... 51.7
Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended January 31, 2021 ................................................. 52.4
Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021, substituting the six
months ended July 31, 2020 with the six months ended July 31, 2019 due to COVID-19[(14)] 104.1

(13) "Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019" is calculated by subtracting the Adjusted EBITDA for the six months
ended January 31, 2019 (€39.7 million) from the Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, (€83.8 million (preIFRS 16)), in each case adjusted to reflect the unaudited estimated impact of IFRS 16 on such periods. As IFRS 16 was adopted
by the Group as of August 1, 2019, the impact of IFRS 16 on our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019 has
not previously been calculated by the Group. As such, the pre-IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019
amounted to €44.2 million. For purposes of estimating the impact of IFRS 16 on our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended
July 31, 2019, the Group has used the amount of rents associated with operating leases for the six months ended July 31, 2020
(€7.5 million) for the adjusted amount, as compared to €7.7 million for the six months ended July 31, 2019. The Group believes
that the amount of rents associated with operating leases are generally stable from one financial period to another.

(14) As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the confinement measures imposed by the governments in our core markets, many
of the stores in our networks were closed for almost two months during the second half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.
While they were closed, these stores recorded no revenue. As a result, our historical results of operations for the six months
ended July 31, 2020 do not reflect what the performance of our business would have been had such confinement measures not
been implemented. In order to assist in the comparability of our results of operations for the twelve months ended January 31,
2021 as compared to prior and future periods, we present herein "Normalized EBITDA" for the twelve months ended January
31, 2021, which has been calculated by adding our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended January 31, 2021 (the first half of
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021) (which reflects the application of IFRS 16) to our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended
July 31, 2019 (the second half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as adjusted to reflect an estimate of the impact of the
application of IFRS 16 during that period) (the "Normalized Period"). We believe that Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months
ended January 31, 2021 is a measure that assists in understanding our performance by substituting Adjusted EBITDA for the six
months ended July 31, 2020 with Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019, which is more representative of our
Adjusted EBITDA performance and takes into account the cyclicality of our business. Normalized EBITDA presented herein is for
informational purposes only. Normalized EBITDA for the twelve months ended January 31, 2021 might not represent what our
Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the same period had the confinement measures not been implemented. In particular,
Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable, that happened or could have happened
during the six months ended July 31, 2020, other than the events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact
of the 100% Santé changes in the optical sector or the increase in number of our stores or (ii) adjust for the positive or negative
effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the six months ended January 31, 2021, in particular the impact of catchup
demand for our products during periods immediately following the reopening of our stores after the end of confinement measures,
as well as the impact of further restrictive measures which have been implemented by the governments in the countries in which
we operate, notably in November 2020 and January 2021 in France, in response to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The normalized and estimated information presented above has been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management and
has not been audited or reviewed and has not been subject to agreed upon procedures by our statutory auditors in accordance
with any generally accepted auditing standards. This information has been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions as
described herein but such assumptions do not take into account all conceivable variables and are therefore inherently subject to
risks and uncertainties. In addition, such assumptions may not give an accurate or complete picture of the Issuer's financial
condition or results of operations, may not be comparable to the Issuer's consolidated financial statements or the other financial
information included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon them when evaluating an
investment decision. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures" and "Risk Factors—The
_adjustments to Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an_
_investment decision"._

(1) In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil discount banner in Spain
and the difficulties encountered in implementing the various components of the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil
banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the Optimil banner and focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain.
Negotiations for a potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018 and the disposal was
completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were treated as discontinued
operations in the income statement of our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019
and 2020.

(2) Excluding VAT. Network sales are not an audited figure and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on network sales.
See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures".

(3) Excluding Optimil. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Optimil disposal in 2018".

(4) The growth in like-for-like network sales for a given period corresponds to the increase in network sales in stores which were open
throughout the entire relevant period under consideration and the entire prior comparative period and for which no substantial
changes (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than one month) or closed have occurred during
period under consideration. Like-for-like network sales are calculated at constant exchange rates (applying the prior year's
exchange rates to the current year), as a very small portion of network sales are currently exposed to currency risk.

_negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to many factors, some_
_of which are beyond our control._

In late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the
world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures have adversely
affected workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased
consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of confinements, have led to an
economic downturn in our markets and have had a direct impact on our business across all of the
countries in which we operate. In March 2020, the governments of the countries in which we operate
imposed significant confinement measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19 and, in doing so,
required the temporary closure of materially all of our stores and, as a result, almost all our revenues
ceased until the phased reopening of our stores in May and June, 2020. Due to restrictions on large
gatherings, our stores located in shopping malls over 10,000 square feet continue to be closed.

Resurgences (or "waves") of COVID-19 have occurred and are likely to continue to occur. We cannot
predict when or where these waves will occur, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur
nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of
future national or local confinements or other measures implemented by the governments and/or local
or regional authorities of the countries in which we operate. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
there are indications that a third wave of COVID-19 is underway in some of the geographies in which
we operate and new national and regional restrictions intended to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 are
being put into place.

In France, due to the persistence of a large number of new infections in the population, the appearance
of coronavirus variants and ongoing pressure on the health system, combined with a slow rollout of
vaccinations (with 5.3 million people vaccinated at mid-March 2021), the government made the decision
to put in place a new nighttime curfew that begins at 18:00 every day (19:00 from March 20, 2021), which
has been in effect since mid-January 2021. In addition, the government has been enforcing closures of
shopping centers of over 20,000 square meters nationwide since January 31, 2021 and of shopping
centers of over 10,000 square meters nationwide since March 6, 2021. For the month of February 2021,
the first wave of closures in French shopping centers impacted 130 of our stores, of which 119 are Alain
Afflelou optical stores, representing around 17% of total network sales (in France, as measured on the
basis of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, our last full-year results pre-COVID-19). These current
partial restrictions, which commenced across 16 French departments (out of 96 in the metropolitan
territory), including the Ile-de-France, on March 20, 2021, were extended to the whole French territory
on April 3, 2021, and are planned to last four weeks, and will allow, as in November, essential businesses
to remain open, apart from those in shopping centers already closed. The new restrictive measures in
smaller shopping centers increased the number of our stores which must be closed by approximately 35
stores to approximately 165, of which approximately 150 were Alain Afflelou optical stores, (representing

40


-----

approximately 20% of our total network sales, as measured on the basis of the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019, our last full-year results pre-COVID-19).

Certain restrictions limit the operating hours and maximum capacity of certain businesses, as well as
requiring that masks are worn and social distancing be observed by patrons of such businesses,
recommending that physical contact and requiring group gatherings be limited. In light of rising case
levels across Europe, future national and local confinements are foreseeable in all of the countries in
which we operate.

Even when our stores are open, social distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further
spread of the disease have impacted and are likely to continue to impact the operation and appeal of
our stores. For example, customers unaccustomed to waiting significant periods of time before entering
stores or to wearing masks or other protective equipment may choose to reduce their visits to brickand-mortar stores. When social distancing policies are lifted, interest in visiting our stores may remain
weak due to health concerns or changes in consumer preferences in favor of online shopping, for
example. We cannot predict when or even if our stores will return to or maintain pre-pandemic business
levels, or if they will be able to maintain pre-pandemic business levels over the mid- to long-term,
especially if subsequent waves continue to occur. Additionally, policies implemented to slow the further
spread of the disease have impacted and will continue to impact our cost of doing business due to,
among other things, the increased cost associated with hygiene measures and track and trace
programs, as applicable.

Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by consumers, public health events
and other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused,
and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity globally, which could lead to a
decline in discretionary spending. Our revenue may be negatively impacted by the adverse changes in
the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income
levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of COVID-19. Our revenue may not increase
in proportion to our fixed costs and deferred costs and our revenue may not be sufficient to offset the
full impact of the shutdown of our stores during the confinement periods. If our cost base is higher than
our revenue, our cash management policies may fail due to factors beyond our control. We and our
franchisees have taken extensive measures to protect our customers and our workforce, in order to
minimize their exposure to COVID-19. However, we cannot be certain that such measures will be
sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 and we may be subject to potential litigation as a
result of customers or our personnel who contract, or believe they have contracted, the virus at our
stores. We may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by employees alleging that we have
facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. We may also
be at risk of litigation following a possible outbreak of coronavirus at one of our stores, which may cause
us to incur further significant costs. In addition, any actual or perceived coronavirus outbreak in one of
our stores could have a negative impact on our reputation. All of these risks may be further exacerbated
by resurgences of the virus. Although governments have increasingly employed sophisticated
strategies for combatting the virus, the magnitude of possible virus resurgences and the resulting
impacts on the economy may materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

Certain of our employees have tested positive for COVID-19. We have been, and may in the future be,
required to temporarily close certain of our stores, offices or other facilities for cleaning or to take other
responsive or precautionary measures. Store closures for more than 24 hours due to positive cases of
COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 through March 31, 2021 were very rare. Likewise, planned construction,
renovation and maintenance, as well as the opening of new stores, have been and may continue to be
delayed, suspended or terminated in order to protect our liquidity and cash position and due to COVID19-related restrictions. Where appropriate and possible, we have transitioned a significant number of
our employees to a remote work environment, which may exacerbate our vulnerability to certain risks,
including, for example, cybersecurity attacks and phishing emails, which we believe is an increased risk
to our business in a remote work environment.

During the first wave of COVID-19 confinements, we relied on access to government aid and mitigation
programs, including access to French state-backed lending. We cannot provide any assurance that
during any subsequent waves of COVID-19 and related confinements such government aid will be
available to the same extent as in the past or at all and, if this were the case, our cash outlay levels
would be significantly higher during such subsequent waves than they were during the initial wave.
Were government support to not be available, or to be available on a more limited basis, we would only

41


-----

be able to rely on our ability to pause capital expenditures, implement cost reductions and defer
payments, which could significantly reduce our overall ability to mitigate cash burn.

In addition to the factors listed above, COVID-19 and the measures taken to respond to it have created
an environment of uncertainty and rapid, unpredictable changes that exacerbates and magnifies certain
of the other risks we face. The effect of COVID-19 on our business and our industry will ultimately
depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak,
the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating
conditions to resume, and the potential for virus resurgence across the markets in which we operate.
There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently
estimate this with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not continue to
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the
extent COVID-19 continues to adversely affect our business, operations, financial condition and
operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this "Risk Factors"
section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash
flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the
agreements that govern our indebtedness.

_We are exposed to macroeconomic and other macro trends that could diminish demand for our_
_products._

Our principal domestic markets are France and Spain, which represented 66.8% and 23.4%,
respectively, and 90.2% collectively, of our stores as of January 31, 2021. Additionally, France and
Spain generated 78.0% and 14.9%, respectively, and 92.9%, collectively, of network sales for the six
months ended January 31, 2021. As a result, we are particularly influenced by economic developments
in France and Spain and a significant economic downturn in either country could have a material
adverse effect on our business. In addition, our franchise operations elsewhere indirectly expose us to
economic trends in those countries because our franchisor revenue is related in part to the level of
franchisee sales, which are subject to local economic conditions, among other things. Insofar as we
expand into other countries and territories, we will become exposed to economic conditions in such
regions.

Macroeconomic trends can have a significant impact on consumer discretionary spending and some of
our products are perceived as more discretionary than others. For example, purchases of nonprescription sunglasses could decline during periods in which disposable income is lower or in periods
of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. Discretionary spending is affected by many
factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, consumer debt levels,
unemployment rates, availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates and other matters that
influence consumer confidence. Many of these factors are outside of our control. For more information
about macroeconomic trends, see "Industry—The optical product market—General optical product
_market drivers" and "Industry—The optical product market—General hearing aid product market_
_drivers"._

Expenses related to our other products, namely corrective lenses, frames and contact lenses are
generally less discretionary and are consequently less dependent on macroeconomic indicators.
However, during a period categorized by difficult economic conditions, we believe that customers may
delay the purchase or replacement of optical products and hearing aids or opt to purchase less
expensive models (for example, plastic frames which generally carry lower selling prices than acetate
frames or lenses without scratch-resistant or anti-reflective coatings). These effects may be more
significant in countries where the level of reimbursement by public and/or private insurance systems is
comparatively low, which is the case for most of the markets in which we carry out our activities, save
for our largest market, France. For example, the optical retail market in Spain, which is our second
home market in terms of network sales and where optical products are not reimbursed by the public
health system and/or private insurance systems, was significantly affected by macroeconomic
difficulties from 2008 to 2013, thus negatively impacting the pace of our development in this country
during that time period.

A portion of our franchisor revenue is directly related to our network sales as royalties or communication
fees that we receive are calculated as a percentage of our network sales. In addition, other revenue
streams are indirectly linked to our network sales, including listing fees paid by suppliers and calculated
on the basis of store purchases, and margins retained in connection with our purchasing and trading
activities. Any deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in France, Spain or the other markets in which
we carry out our activities or into which we decide to expand may result in short- and long-term

42


-----

decreases in consumer disposable income and demand, may lead to lower overall Group network sales
or to changes in the mix of products that we sell in ways that may impact our overall profitability and
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.

_Our performance is subject to our ability to adapt to evolving customer tastes and preferences._

Consumer purchasing decisions regarding optical and hearing aid products are generally influenced by
highly subjective factors, including fit, style, brand and durability. The tastes and preferences of
customers in terms of optical and hearing aid products are subject to change based on demographics
and fashion, lifestyle and other trends. Fashion and aesthetic considerations, technical and
technological advances, as well as increased health and well-being awareness, have had and are likely
to continue to have a significant effect on consumer purchasing decisions and on the type of products
offered and sold by us and our franchisees. While our individual stores may offer a customized selection
(ordered via our listing and payment unit) of frames and hearing aids that they believe correspond best
to customer demand, the optical products and hearing aids that we offer and/or make available to stores
in our networks may not reflect the needs, tastes and preferences of customers. As a result, the offering
of such products by us and our franchisees may fail to meet customers' expectations or respond to
customer demand. This risk is particularly acute as we focus most of our marketing efforts on our ownbranded products which, if they are unsuccessful in attracting customer interest, could lead to reduced
sales volumes. In addition, the commercial offers and advertising campaigns that we launch may not
appropriately target potential customers.

In order to cater to evolving customer tastes and preferences, we continuously monitor our stores and
websites and make strategic decisions to adjust our product offering, open, close or refurbish stores,
revise store concepts and layouts and expand or enhance our websites. However, we may not be able
to anticipate and implement decisions regarding our stores or websites with sufficient speed or efficacy
and our product offering and the location, concept and layout of our stores and websites may not
correspond to customers' needs and tastes. For more information about consumers' preferences, see
"Industry—General Optical Product Market Drivers—Consumption trends and demographics". Failures
and delays in responding to customer tastes and demands or in optimizing our stores and websites
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

**_Risks related to the French healthcare system_**

_We are exposed to risk relating to the reimbursement framework in France._

The demand for our products in France, which is our principal market, representing 78.0% of our
network sales for the six months ended January 31, 2021, is directly impacted by the level of
reimbursement provided by the French public health system and/or under private insurance policies
offered by complementary health insurance companies (OCAMs). Reimbursement received from the
public health system accounts for a small fraction of the total reimbursement received by customers,
particularly for optical products, with the remainder being reimbursed by OCAMs and borne by the
customer. Nonetheless, the public health system plays a significant role in the optical product market
as reimbursement by OCAMs is conditional upon reimbursement by the public health system. Any
decrease in the level of reimbursement for optical and hearing aid expenses that customers obtain from
either the public health system or OCAMs would negatively impact their spending power.

For example, one important characteristic of an OCAM contract is whether it is deemed "responsible"
by the French public health authorities and thus qualifies for favorable tax treatment. OCAM contracts
are deemed "responsible" if they comply with a number of criteria, including, as of April 1, 2015, the
imposition of minimum and maximum thresholds on reimbursements of optical products. The maximum
reimbursement threshold for qualification as "responsible" has been set at €800 for a pair of glasses. In
general, the legislation provides that the maximum price for a pair of glasses with unifocal lenses is set
at €420 (the exact maximum price depends on prescription strength) and for a pair of glasses with
multifocal lenses at €800 (the exact maximum price depends on prescription strength) and, in each
case, including a maximum of €100 per frame irrespective of the type of lenses used.

Other regulatory changes may impact us. For example, under Decree no 2014-1374, the maximum
replacement frequency for glasses was changed from one to two years (other than for children or in
case of a change in prescription or breakage) in 2014. In addition, the Loi Macron n° 2015-990 (loi pour
_la croissance, l'activité et l'égalité des chances économiques) is aimed at introducing more transparency_

43


-----

in the market for optical products by differentiating prices charged for optical products from prices
charged for associated services (such as adjusting frames to fit customers). These provisions of the Loi
Macron, initially due to come into effect on January 1, 2018, were postponed and came into effect on
January 1, 2020. They may foster increased competition as prices charged for each product or service
become easier to understand and may ultimately result in price decreases. Such a breakdown of prices
may also encourage OCAMs to further differentiate between products and services when setting
reimbursement levels, which may negatively impact customers' spending power.

The 100% Santé measures, which are aimed at improving access to and reducing costs of healthcare
products such as glasses and hearing aids for end consumers, impact us. The main aspects of the
100% Santé measures, which started from January 2020 in the optical sector, are:

    - a "zero consumer cost" (RAC Zéro) offer, which consists of a basic "basket" for unifocal
and multifocal glasses (set at approximately €100 and €195, for the most common unifocal
and for multifocal glasses with thin, anti-reflective lenses, respectively). All opticians are
required to make this offer available to customers, offering a minimum range of 17 frames
for adults and 10 frames for children. Every quote to customers must include a zero
consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer. The basket for frames is set at a maximum of €30. As a
comparison, according to a 2020 Gallileo survey, in France, a pair of unifocal glasses costs
consumers on average €304 and a pair of multifocal glasses costs consumers on average
€551;

    - a reduction in the reimbursement cap used by private health insurers to €100 for frames,
as compared to the previous cap of €150 and as contrasted with an average cost for frames
of €113 (for unifocal lenses) and €158 (for multifocal lenses), according to a 2019 Gallileo
survey; and

    - the option for opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by French public health
insurance, for approximately €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a
prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago.

In the hearing aid sector, similar discussions have also been conducted and the zero consumer cost
(RAC Zéro) offer for hearing aids has been set more progressively (€1,300 in 2019 (the price ceiling for
"Segment I" products, with a co-pay from the customer), €1,100 in 2020 (the price ceiling for "Segment
I" products, with a co-pay from the customer) and €950 in 2021 (the price ceiling for "Segment I"
products, with no co-pay from the customer)). GfK estimated an average price of €1,552 for a hearing
aid device in 2019 which had decreased to an average price of €1,535 by July 2020. Before the full
implementation of the RAC Zéro offer for hearing aids in 2021, the out-of-pocket cost of hearing aids
was between €700 and €1,000, according to a 2019 Arcane report. As in the optical market, there is,
on one hand, a higher proportion of value-added products (such as, in-ear devices and remote
headphones), and, on the other hand, the increased offering of reasonably priced devices and, since
January 2021, the ability for end customers to acquire a hearing aid device (valued up to €950) without
any out-of-pocket expense. For more information about reimbursement schemes in France, see
"Regulation—France—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system".
The impact of such regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects. See "—Risks related to our hearing aid business—The
_existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is particularly important for sales of our hearing_
_aids in France"_ and "—Risks related to legal and regulatory matters—Risks related to laws and
_regulations—We operate in a highly regulated business environment and predicting legal and regulatory_
_changes or developments is difficult"._

_We may be materially disadvantaged by the increasing influence of care networks in France._

Care networks act as intermediaries between OCAMs and healthcare professionals, including opticians
and audio prosthetists. Care networks may be "open", admitting all professionals who satisfy certain
criteria defined by the care network, or "closed", which limit the number of healthcare professionals able
to join the care network. For further information about care networks, see "Industry—The optical product
_market—Our optical product geographic markets". OCAM members are often incentivized to go to_
opticians that have joined the care network affiliated with their insurance provider, because they are
likely to be reimbursed at a higher rate than they would be at an optician that is not a member of a care
network that is affiliated with their insurance provider. Additionally, OCAMs increasingly require that
customers purchase optical and hearing aid products from a store that has joined a care network in
order to benefit from third-party payment, i.e., the reimbursement of optical and hearing aid expenses

44


-----

made by the relevant OCAM through direct payment to the optician or audio prosthetist. In 2020,
according to Gallileo, approximately 70% of people were covered by an OCAM using a care network
and 30% actually used an optician recommended by that OCAM's care network. A considerable number
of OCAMs have joined a care network and we believe the proportion of people using an optician
recommended by such care networks will continue to grow in the future.

Customers and OCAMs are making greater use of care networks, which exercise significant influence
on how optical products and hearing aids are reimbursed in France. In particular, membership in care
networks may affect our commercial strategy as prices and standards may be strongly influenced by
such care networks. Certain care networks may impose limits on which suppliers we may use and which
products we may offer, sometimes even requiring the purchase of such care network's own products.
The increasing influence and negotiating power of care networks, as well as the increasing share of the
population whose health insurance is covered by an OCAM that has joined a care network, may also
lead to a general decline in prices of optical products and hearing aids in the long term in France due
to care networks' willingness to be more attractive to OCAMs by selecting optical and hearing aid retail
stores offering products at lower prices, thus potentially reducing the levels of reimbursement made by
OCAMs and consequently healthcare professionals' margins and profits.

Our store network in France was previously underrepresented in care networks, as we discouraged our
franchised stores from joining such care networks prior to 2014. Since then, our networks have been
actively joining such care networks, with support provided by the Group to franchisees who wish to join
such care networks. We believe we are now well-situated as regards membership of our franchised
stores in the care networks. Further, the operations of stores in our network in France that have not
already joined a care network may be adversely impacted as customers are incentivized to go to optical
retail stores that are members of their care network where they will be able to benefit from a higher level
of reimbursement. There also can be no guarantee that franchisees in our network who are not currently
part of a care network will be admitted in the future or that our franchisees' membership in care networks
will be maintained. As a consequence, our franchisees could lose market share among those care
networks or could be affected by tighter conditions in the new partnerships, which could have an
adverse effect on our franchisor business. For more information about care networks in France, see
"Regulation—France—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system".

_The demand for our optical products and hearing aids may be adversely affected by the shortage of_
_certain health professionals, such as ophthalmologists and audio prosthetists, in France._

Unlike other countries, where optometrists may conduct routine eye examinations and prescribe
corrective lenses and contact lenses, before the implementation of the 100% Santé changes, only
ophthalmologists were permitted to prescribe corrective lenses in France. Although ophthalmological
prescriptions are generally valid for a maximum of five years, there is a limited number of
ophthalmologists in France and customers may have to wait a significant period of time before securing
an appointment with an ophthalmologist and obtaining a prescription for optical products. In France,
hearing aids are prescribed by ear, nose and throat specialists but patients must be subsequently
outfitted with hearing aids by an audio prosthetist.

We believe that there is a shortage of both ophthalmologists and audio prosthetists in France, our
principal market, and that this shortage may continue in the future. The overall number of physicians as
well as the number of medical interns in each specialty is limited by a numerus clausus system which
is determined by governmental decrees. Although the numerus clausus has increased in recent years,
the number of graduating ophthalmologists and audio prosthetists in France remains limited. Thus, we
believe that patients may still encounter difficulties in obtaining appointments with ophthalmologists and
audio prosthetists within a short timeframe, in particular in rural areas. In certain areas, it is also difficult
to recruit sufficient numbers of audio prosthetists to ensure the development of the Alain Afflelou
Acousticien banner. As a result, we believe that the shortage of ophthalmologists affects both the
demand for and number of purchases of optical products by customers in France and the shortage of
audio prosthetists affects our ability to respond to the demand for hearing aids in France.
Notwithstanding recent increases to the _numerus clausus for each of these professions, and, more_
generally, measures to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a prescription from an ophthalmologist
provided, in most cases, less than five years ago, we believe that such shortages may continue to have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For
further information about the regulatory environment in France, see "Regulation" and "Recent
_Developments—Changes in the regulatory environment"._

**_Risks related to our franchise activities_**

_Our revenue may decrease significantly if our franchisees do not generate sufficient sales or if current_
_or former franchisees use our know-how and commercial offers similar to ours to our detriment._

Our revenue depends on our franchisees' ability to generate sales from the operation of their stores. As
of January 31, 2021, 88.9% of stores in our networks were operated by franchisees and our franchisor
activities generated 72.0% of our revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2021. We occasionally
terminate franchise contracts, leading to the closure of certain franchised stores. For instance, in the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, we terminated a master franchise agreement with a hearing aid
company that had previously been in charge of developing our banner in Spain. At the time of
termination, this partner accounted for 18 hearing centers and approximately €2.5 million of network
sales per year. For further information, see "Recent Developments—Termination of a master franchise
_agreement in the hearing aid sector in Spain". During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, the Alain_
Afflelou optical banner was also impacted by the termination of a franchise agreement with a partner
holding six stores in the center of France. Further, in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, our sales in
our discount banner in Spain were strongly impacted by the termination of franchise agreements and
store closures.

Although most terminations of our franchise agreements have historically been made following a
franchisee's failure to implement our commercial policies or for non-payment or due to poor
performance or inadequate location of the store, the closure of franchised stores may adversely affect
our reputation and reduce the amount of franchisor fees and commissions we receive from franchisees.

We may also face competition from our former franchisees. In the event of non-renewal or termination
of a franchise agreement, a former franchisee may decide to conduct business as an independent
optician or join a competing network following the expiry or breach of the one-year non-compete clause,
included in the franchise agreement. In addition, a disgruntled franchisee may decide to share our knowhow or other confidential information with persons outside the Group, including with the press. As all
franchisees benefit from our know-how and expertise, including in particular our communications and
marketing strategies, competition from former franchisees or the unauthorized sharing of such knowhow may undermine our competitive advantage that this know-how provides and have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our franchisees are independent operators and we have limited influence over their operations._

Our revenue substantially depends upon our franchisees' sales volumes. However, our franchisees are
independent operators and we cannot control many factors that impact the performance of franchised
stores. Although we are responsible for, among other things, implementing marketing and
communications strategies and preparing merchandizing and store layout and decoration concepts,
franchisees may set their own business targets and devise their own means to achieve them. We are
not in a position to impose budgetary constraints on our franchisees that would otherwise help to ensure
that their performance is maximized and maintain consistency across stores in our networks. For
instance, our franchise agreements require franchisees to regularly update their store layout to reflect
our latest store concept, but franchisees are responsible for financing the refurbishment and may delay
the process, which may harm our brand image and undermine our reputation and negatively impact our
commercial practices across our network. In addition, our strategy in recent years has been to
implement common tools for use by all franchisees in order to improve and harmonize commercial
practices across our networks and enhance their relationships with customers. Franchisees may be
reluctant to accept any such initiatives. For more information about our franchisees, see "Business—
_Description of our business—Franchise model"._

In addition, we have been and may from time to time be subject to allegations that we failed to
adequately monitor our franchisees, particularly in the context of allegations that such franchisees have
committed health insurance fraud. Customers show low sensitivity to price when they expect insurance
providers to fully or even partially reimburse optical product and hearing aid costs. As a result, some of
our franchisees may be tempted to artificially inflate the price of optical products and hearing aids sold
to a customer, up to the reimbursement threshold set by the customer's OCAM. Any such claims may
undermine our reputation, result in the imposition of fines, and could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

We also face the risk that franchisees may intentionally work against our interests. For example,
franchisees may fail to pay fees when due or at all, may publicly object to certain fees or may decide to

46


-----

share our confidential information or know-how with persons outside the Group, including the press.
Additionally, a disgruntled franchisee may decide to share his or her complaints with other franchisees
in an attempt to incite collective action against us. While such behavior might violate the terms of the
given franchise agreement, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our franchisees may challenge the terms of our franchise agreements._

There can be no assurance that our franchisees will continue to accept the terms of our franchise
agreements, in particular the levels of fees and commissions that we charge them in exchange for the
services we provide as franchisor. For more information about our franchise agreements, see
"Business—Description of our business—Franchise model—Our franchise agreements". In the main
European countries where we operate networks of stores, our franchisees are represented by a national
franchisee commission (the "CNF") which we implemented to facilitate relationships between us and
our franchisees. In France, for example, the CNF is composed of 15 members for a term of three years.
Members are elected by the franchisees in the jurisdiction covered by such CNF. For example, our
advertising plan is prepared by management and presented to the CNFs on an annual basis. Similarly,
the level of communication fees to be paid by franchisees for the implementation of our advertising plan
is submitted for CNF approval on an annual basis. The CNF is likely to have greater bargaining power
than individual franchisees and may in the future successfully contest some of the terms of our franchise
agreements and commercial arrangements with franchisees and in particular the level of
communication fees. Moreover, although this has not occurred to date, our franchisees may initiate
formal or informal collective actions against us. Any such action from franchisees could have a material
adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As
of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are no material conflicts or proceedings between us
and our franchisees. For more information about the CNF, see "Business—Description of our
_business—Franchise model—Franchisee representation"._

_Our relationships with franchisees are subject to regulations applicable to franchise agreements,_
_particularly in France._

We are subject to regulations governing the relationship between a franchisor and its franchisees in
France and other countries where we carry out our activities. In particular, we are subject to regulations
preventing undue interference of a franchisor in the franchisees' business operations, as well as
regulations requiring that we provide certain information to existing and potential franchisees. In France,
pursuant to the Loi Doubin and the resulting provisions of the French Commercial Code, we are required
to provide potential franchisees, or current franchisees contemplating the opening of a new store, with
certain information, including concerning the Group, the network and the contract at least twenty days
prior to entering into a franchise agreement. For more information about regulations applicable to
franchise contracts, see "Regulation".

Any claim that we have violated regulations applicable to our relationships with franchisees, including
claims that we failed to provide sufficient information or support to a franchisee or claims that we
impeded the ability of a franchisee to conduct its business freely, may among other things result in the
imposition of fines on us, harm our relationships with our franchisees, require us to compensate the
affected franchisees or potentially trigger claims for contract annulment on the grounds of lack of
consent, negatively impact the likelihood of potential franchisees joining our networks, and have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects. Additionally, in France under French franchise law, franchisees are independent
entrepreneurs who have freely entered into franchise contracts with a franchisor to trade under one of
our banners and use our brand names and know-how in exchange for payment of certain fees and
royalties. Although we are not responsible for the employees hired by our franchisees, any change in
the relevant laws or re-characterization of the employment relationships between our franchisees and/or
their employees by a court or tribunal could oblige us to either hire such employees directly or make
arrangements causing us to incur liabilities related to contributions to certain social security programs,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.

Additionally, regulations pertaining to the relationships we have with our franchisees are likely to
change. New regulations may be introduced in the future or be amended. In particular, rules that may
require us to put in place a franchisee or employee representative body may be modified or replaced.

_governing franchise operations in Spain"._

_We rely on franchisee's accurate reporting of their sales as a key performance indicator and the basis_
_of calculation of fees owed by franchisees._

We rely on our franchisees to accurately report network sales in order to evaluate the performance of
our networks and to calculate the fees we are entitled to collect under the terms of the franchise
agreements. We use network sales to produce key performance indicators that are used for a variety
of business planning and evaluation functions. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, franchisees are
required to self-report certain performance indicators relating to their business, including sales levels,
on a monthly basis. From time to time, franchisees may fail, intentionally or unintentionally, to accurately
report their sales performance. Although franchisees are also required to provide us with a copy of their
annual audited accounts, some franchisees may report sales levels that are lower than the actual sales
levels. As a result, such franchisees may be charged lower royalties and communication fees than they
would have been charged had they reported their actual sales levels. Following certain acquisitions, we
may not be able to accurately monitor the sales of our new franchisees and correctly evaluate the
relevant fees. The related reporting of these franchisees may be inaccurate and we may not be receiving
accurate information at this stage. In addition, if a material number of franchisees do not correctly report
their sales, or if such reports are delayed, our network sales numbers will not be accurate, reducing the
relevance of network sales as a key performance indicator to assist in strategic planning and our ability
to analyze, plan and forecast our performance may be affected. We may also have to incur significant
expense to obtain compliance with such reporting requirements. Any difficulties in monitoring and
overseeing our franchisees' operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to our competitors_**

_We operate in a highly competitive environment and we may not continue to compete effectively._

We operate in the competitive but fragmented optical and hearing aid retail markets. Certain of our
competitors may have greater financial resources, lower cost structures, larger purchasing economies
of scale or better entrenched relationships with suppliers than us. Additionally, although the markets in
which we operate remain fragmented, the optical retail industry in France and Europe has generally
been dominated over the past decades by large retail optical chains operating in various countries in
which our stores are located, such as Krys and Optic 2000 in France, or by the rise of other banners
like Générale d'Optique or Optical Center. This pattern is also true for certain leading European optical
retailers (such as GrandVision, Specsavers and Fielmann), who have also gained market share in
recent years. In addition, the takeover of GrandVision by EssilorLuxottica, which was announced in July
2019, may have a significant impact on our market, with a potential vertical integration between leading
global players.

In the hearing aid market in France, our main competitors, such as Audika, Amplifon and Audition
Conseil, are already well-established operators. We also compete with several hearing aid suppliers
which have become direct competitors by acquiring certain independent hearing aid retailers or chains
that specialize in the distribution of hearing aids. For example, William Demant (which manufactures
hearing aids under brands such as Oticon, Bernafon and Sonic) purchased a controlling stake in Audika
in 2015 and Sonova (which manufactures under brands such as Phonak and Unitron) owns Audition
Santé. This trend towards greater forward integration in the hearing aid market in certain countries may
weaken our competitive position.

Consolidation trends in our optical and hearing aid products markets may result in the establishment of
large purchasing or vertically-integrated groups combining supplier and retailer capacities, with greater
leeway, leverage and resources than us may have an impact on our purchasing power and adversely
impact the terms of our commercial agreements with our suppliers. Certain leading optical products
manufacturers have gained significant market share over the past decade. For example, in October
2018 optical product manufacturer Luxottica completed its merger with lens manufacturer Essilor,
creating an integrated group, EssilorLuxottica, which is currently contemplating a takeover of
Grandvision. Forward integration by some of our suppliers may further increase the competitive
pressure we face.

In the optical retail market, independent retailers still represent a large proportion of the total number of
stores in countries in which we operate. In France, independent retailers are sometimes able to adopt

48


-----

aggressive commercial strategies. In Spain, a pattern of independent retailers joining buying groups
has emerged, with a focus on opening small stores requiring limited capital expenditure. Furthermore,
independent retailers also control a large part of the French hearing aid products market. For more
information about our competitive environment, see "Industry". Independent retailers may continue, in
response to the growing presence of large competitors in the market, to adopt more aggressive
strategies to maintain their market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our competitors may adopt more aggressive
pricing policies. For instance, in the quarter ended April 30, 2018, our sales in Belgium were impacted
by aggressive commercial policies adopted by our two main competitors. In addition, our competitors
may further diversify their product offerings, enhance their presence in geographical markets in which
we have a significant presence or be more effective and faster in capturing available market
opportunities thereby undermining our competitive position and potentially weakening our market share.

_We may be adversely impacted by new market entrants._

Certain optical products that we sell, such as ready-made reading glasses ("ready readers"), nonprescription sunglasses and contact lens care solutions are also sold through distribution channels other
than optical retail stores. Those types of products may be distributed by pharmacists (primarily contact
lens care solutions), fashion retailers, department stores or other points of sale, including websites.
While we believe that the value-added services provided by opticians in our stores are not available to
customers when buying through such alternative distribution channels, any increasing popularity of such
distribution channels may adversely affect our business. The Loi Hamon, adopted in 2014, loosened
restrictions on online sales of optical products prescribed by qualified opticians, and also facilitated
online purchases of prescription optical products for customers, by requiring that ophthalmologists
specify interpupillary distance on all prescriptions, i.e., the distance between the two pupils that
customers are not able to measure on their own but would otherwise have to obtain from an optician.
Since 2014, several online optical retailers have emerged in France, and many of the large retail optical
chains, including us, have opened their own retail websites. In March 2014, we launched an ecommerce website providing an additional distribution channel for our optical products. Since then, our
online business has expanded with the acquisition of pure players (Happyview and Malentille.com),
which we have integrated into our wider online offer. Our e-commerce activity remains limited in terms
of total network sales and corresponds in large proportion to contact lenses sales. During the initial
COVID-19 confinement in the spring of 2020, our online sales increased and, as our online presence
expands, we are increasingly better at tracking consumer habits and needs. We may, however, be at a
time-to-market disadvantage in relation to our competitors, including pure players, who may have
established online presences and developed experience in this distribution channel earlier than we
have. If we are unable to keep up with our competitors or to further develop our online platform, it may
translate into lost sales, particularly with respect to contact lenses, a segment which is forecast to grow
at approximately 3% per annum until 2025 in France, according to SWV, as customers are generally
more inclined to purchase contact lenses than frames online.

Finally, in a number of geographical markets in which we carry out our activities, including in France
and Spain, our domestic markets, only opticians and audio prosthetists are allowed to sell corrective
lenses and hearing aids, respectively, effectively creating a near monopoly for the sale of these
products. As a result, retailers in these countries must employ opticians and audio prosthetists in order
to offer these products to customers.

At present, there is a sufficient number of opticians in France, which has effectively weakened the
impact of this monopoly, while the current shortage of audio prosthetists in France has strengthened
the practical impact of the audio prosthetists' monopoly. If opticians' and audio prosthetists' monopolies
were challenged or weakened, the barriers to entering the market would be lower, and a larger number
of new participants could enter the market and/or current market participants could reinforce their
position in this market. For example, certain provisions of the Loi Hamon allow non-qualified opticians
to manage optical retail stores as long as responsible personnel at the stores are qualified opticians.
This provision is designed to increase competition within the industry, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As regards
hearing aids, the risk that new players may enter the market could also become greater if, as a
consequence of regulatory changes, the qualifications required to sell hearing aids become less
stringent in response to the shortage of audio prosthetists in a number of the markets in which we carry
out our activities, particularly in France. Such changes may, in turn, adversely affect our ability to
compete effectively and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial

49


-----

condition and prospects. Further, there is a risk that hearing aid manufacturers may expand their
operations to the optical products market and compete with us.

**_Risks related to technological changes_**

_Technical, technological or medical advances may reduce the attractiveness of our products._

The optical and hearing aid products industries have experienced considerable technological changes
in recent years, which has reduced and may continue to reduce or render obsolete the use of certain
optical products and hearing aids sold by us. For example, laser eye surgery aims at permanently
correcting certain vision deficiencies, specifically refractive ametropia (including myopia), by means of
surgical intervention. Laser eye surgery has been performed for over thirty years, though the number
of such surgical procedures in France remains stable and relatively low (estimated by SWV to be
approximately 155,000 eye surgeries in 2020). Nevertheless, eye surgery may develop significantly in
the future, either through innovations that improve the surgical methods employed (such as the femtolasik laser technique, which provides a superior quality of eye surgery, or the development of intracorneal surgery that aims to correct presbyopia) or by rendering those specialized surgical procedures
more affordable, more accessible or less invasive. Certain specialized treatments such as
orthokeratology (also known as corneal reshaping), involve the use of night-only contact lenses to
correct myopia and presbyopia, which are dispensed by optometrists. Other potential new technologies,
such as gene therapy and cell regeneration, may also succeed at permanently improving or correcting
vision and/or hearing in the future. Similarly, if medical research were to lead to a cure for the various
forms of hearing loss, such as by surgical techniques, the use of pharmaceuticals or breakthrough biotechnological innovations or therapies, our profitability could suffer through a reduction in the sales and
revenue of the Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner. Other potential innovations, such as the development
of self-fitting hearing aids or personal sound amplifiers, could result in a decreased use of our products.
Moreover, we may be unable to replicate certain innovations developed and marketed by our
competitors or we may experience delays before we are able to distribute innovative products, thereby
decreasing the attractiveness of our offering. Any or all of the above factors may lead to a corresponding
decline in network sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects.

_Hearing aid development cycles range from two to three years and we may not be able to develop or_
_exploit new technologies in time to remain competitive._

Hearing aids have been the subject of technological advances, such as the switch from analogue
hearing aids to digital hearing aids in the 1990s, that changed market patterns during this period and
led to a global market realignment among customers and market players on the basis of this new
structure. To remain competitive, we must be able to introduce new hearing aid models to our offer as
quickly as possible. For example, hearing aid technology generally changes approximately every two
to three years. In addition, the use of hearing aids entails a number of additional costs, for example the
cost of adjusting a hearing aid to the wearer and the many appointments required before purchasing a
hearing aid. The purchase process is long and uncertain and some consumers may not complete the
process. Our inability to meet customer demands for new technologies, or the inability to offer
technologies that perform at the same level as those of our competitors, could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We face operational and other risks in relation to e-commerce and online sales._

Although the portion of revenue that we derive from online sales is currently limited, e-commerce is
expected to be an increasingly important part of our strategy in the years to come. Our e-commerce
operations are subject to numerous risks, including:

  - reliance on third parties for certain ordering and customer fulfillment software and payment
services;

  - vulnerability to phishing, hacking and system breaches, which could expose us to regulatory
action or consumer complaints that could damage our reputation and our business, as well as
more general risks associated with cybersecurity, some of which may be magnified by work
from home and through other remote working arrangements;

  - the risk that our websites may become unstable or unavailable due to failures or necessary
upgrades of our computer systems or related IT support systems, or disruption of Internet
service;

  - difficulty integrating our e-commerce platform with our store networks;

50


-----

  - violations of national, EU or international laws, including those relating to online privacy;

  - liability for online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems,
even if we use the 3D-Secure Protocol designed to ensure enhanced security and strong
identification for our customers when they use their debit or credit cards for online purchases;

  - the incurrence of additional costs due to the necessity of investing in search engine
optimization, the maintenance of our online brand presence and online connectivity that is
commensurate with our brand positioning and optimization of the interface, allowing customers
to easily locate, access and use our websites; and

  - the risk that pure players will manage to successfully develop brick-and-mortar operations in
certain locations, such as pharmacies.

_Our failure to respond appropriately to risks relating to e-commerce and online sales and uncertainties_
_could reduce our revenue from e-commerce, as well as damage our reputation and brand image._

Furthermore, we may not be able to continue growing and developing our e-commerce platform as
planned, due to technical difficulties in adapting our business model to this distribution channel or other
factors. The development of online sales is an ongoing, complex undertaking and there is no guarantee
that any resources we apply to this effort will result in increased revenue or operating performance. In
addition to the competitive pressures discussed in "—Risks related to our competitors", the
development of our online channel also faces specific competitive pressures. Consumers connect to
our websites using a variety of devices (such as computers, tablets and smart phones) and operating
systems (such as Windows, iOS and Android) which requires us to constantly strive to optimize our
websites for such devices and systems. In addition, our e-commerce platform may also, to a certain
extent, compete with our stores and cannibalize our in-store sales. The online channel presents a
unique opportunity to directly engage with consumers from their homes but also poses organizational
and technical challenges. A failure to successfully respond to the growing trend of e-commerce or,
conversely, a failure to implement our plan to develop our online channel could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to our brand, reputation and employees_**

_Our success is dependent upon the skills and continued service of our existing senior management_
_team and of technically skilled employees._

The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued efforts
and motivation of our senior management team and other key personnel, as well as on their
relationships with, and their understanding of the requirements of, our franchisees and suppliers. In
addition, our growth strategy and forecasts depend on senior management's deep knowledge of our
business operations. If one or more members of the existing senior management is unable or unwilling
to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to find management personnel with the same
experience and industry knowledge to replace or recruit such individuals. Our prior CEO resigned in
2020, and we currently have an acting CEO until a new permanent CEO is found. We are currently in
the process of searching for and evaluating potential candidates to fill the role of permanent CEO and
hope to conclude this process in the coming weeks or months, although we cannot currently predict
how long this process will take. The departure of any member of our senior management team could
impact us more seriously than the loss of other personnel. Furthermore, if any member of the senior
management team or other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, following
the expiry or breach of the relevant non-compete clause, we may lose customers, know-how and other
key personnel. The resignation or unexpected departure of one or more members of senior
management or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

We also believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract, motivate and
retain qualified, skilled and experienced personnel who can contribute to maintaining and enhancing
our reputation by providing services in accordance with our high standards. In France, our stores must
employ opticians and audio prosthetists who satisfy the educational and training requirements that allow
them to provide optical and hearing aid product services. Although we believe there is currently a
sufficient number of trained opticians in France, it may be difficult for some of our stores to hire and
retain the employees needed for their business. Furthermore, we believe that there is currently a
shortage of ophthalmologists and audio prosthetists in a number of the geographic markets in which
we operate, notably in France, and that this shortage may continue in the future, as discussed in "—
_Risks related to the French healthcare system—The demand for our optical products and hearing aids_

51


-----

_may be adversely affected by the shortage of certain health professionals, such as ophthalmologists_
_and audio prosthetists, in France". Thus, it may also be difficult for some of our stores to hire and retain_
the employees needed for their business. An inability to attract and retain qualified employees in a
timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

_Our success is linked to our founder._

Mr. Alain Afflelou, our founder, has been associated with our image and brand for both optical products
and hearing aids, particularly in France, from the inception of the brand. We believe that, under the
aegis of Mr. Alain Afflelou, the Group has significantly changed the optical and hearing aid retail industry
in France by making available to the general public reasonably priced optical products and hearing aids
of superior quality. Mr. Alain Afflelou has historically played a key role in our marketing and
communications strategies and is frequently featured in marketing and advertising materials. As an
optician by training, Mr. Alain Afflelou played an important role in enabling the brand to be perceived as
offering optical products of the highest quality. We believe that the general public in France perceives
a close connection between Mr. Alain Afflelou and the Alain Afflelou banner. Additionally, some of our
franchisees, particularly in France, also continue to associate the brand with Mr. Alain Afflelou as well
as, to a certain extent, his three sons who are also employed by us. In consideration of the key role
Mr. Alain Afflelou plays in the Group and the fact that he is a well-known public figure, if he were to
leave the Group for any reason, or if his personal reputation were to be harmed, this could have a
material adverse effect on our reputation, brand awareness, business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

_Our success depends substantially on our brand awareness, reputation and know-how._

Our reputation, brand awareness and know-how are essential in ensuring the continued success and
performance of our business model. The reputation of our brands is based primarily on commercial
offers and product innovation, as well as our ability to convey a strong image to the general public
through effective marketing and communications strategies. If we were to decrease spending levels on
marketing and communications, for example due to an increase in advertising costs or other constraints
that would make it difficult to maintain current levels of media coverage, or due to the rejection by the
CNF (the elected representatives of franchisees) of our proposed communication fees, we may be
unable to maintain our brand awareness, boost in-store traffic or stimulate sales and our revenue could
be negatively impacted. In addition, there can be no assurance that our advertising and communications
campaigns will be successful, resonate with consumers or generate more traffic to our stores and
websites. We also undertake direct communications and marketing activities, such as point-of-sale
display materials, catalogues as well as email and mobile phone text messaging. We can provide no
assurance that our communications, advertising and marketing activities will be successful in promoting
and maintaining brand awareness.

As discussed in "—Risks related to our franchise activities—Our franchisees are independent operators
_and we have limited influence over their operations", our reputation may also be harmed by franchisees_
that operate their stores in a manner which is not consistent with our professional standards or with
regulatory requirements. While we may terminate commercial relationships with franchisees that do not
comply with such standards or requirements, any delay in identifying and addressing an incident may
harm our image and reputation. For instance, we have in the past detected evidence of health insurance
fraud on the part of certain franchisees. Even if we are not ultimately liable for our franchisees' behavior,
any incident, claim or proceeding resulting from such behavior may harm our brand, undermine our
reputation, give rise to negative publicity or hinder our ability to attract and retain franchisees. A
deterioration in the quality of services offered by our franchisees, delays in the development and
implementation of our marketing and communications strategies, a decline in the quality of optical
products and hearing aids offered to customers by the stores within our networks, or faults or defects
discovered in certain products marketed by us may result in negative publicity. The damage to our
reputation may be exacerbated by any failure on our part to respond effectively to such an incident.
Such events that harm our brand, reputation or image could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our success depends on our ability to protect our brands and other intellectual property rights._

We believe that our Alain Afflelou, Afflelou-Paris, Optical Discount, Alain Afflelou Acousticien,
Malentille.com and Afflelou Sun banners and other intellectual property rights that cover the products
and services we offer, including trademarks and domain names, are key assets that are fundamental
to our success and position. We are therefore dependent on our ability to protect and promote our

52


-----

brands and other intellectual property rights, especially as we open stores in emerging markets (for
more information about our intellectual property rights and how we protect these rights, see "Business—
_Research and development, patents and licenses"). We cannot guarantee that our products and_
services do not infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights
will not be challenged by third parties, including competitors. We may for instance be subject to
intellectual property rights claims with respect to products that resemble some of our competitors'
designs and models. If a court were to determine that one or more of our products infringes upon
intellectual property rights held by others, we could be required to stop using such intellectual property
or pay damages or royalties to holders of such intellectual property rights. We also cannot guarantee
that third parties will not infringe upon our intellectual property rights, for instance by using our brands
or copying our products. In addition, we may be unable to adequately register and protect our intellectual
property rights as we enter new markets, a risk that is particularly acute in emerging markets such as
China. Should our intellectual property rights be challenged or infringed upon, or should we infringe
upon intellectual property rights of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to our general operations_**

_We may be unable to successfully manage and develop our existing banners, brands and store_
_networks._

We currently plan to further develop our main banners. Our operations are organized under the following
banners and brands: (i) a generalist banner, Alain Afflelou, with sister brands Afflelou Sun (sunglasses
only) and Afflelou-Paris (in emerging markets); (ii) a discount banner, Optical Discount; and (iii) a
hearing aid banner, Alain Afflelou Acousticien.

In France, we operate our discount banner, Optical Discount, as a secondary banner in order to target
price conscious customers and offer a broad range of optical products through comprehensive offers at
a lower price point than the Alain Afflelou banner. As we continue to operate two different optical
banners within the same market (the Alain Afflelou banner and the discount banner Optical Discount in
France), we have experienced difficulties in differentiating those banners' images, commercial
strategies and objectives in a way that allows them to coexist while targeting different segments within
the optical retail market. Our franchisees generally benefit from an exclusive territory in the area where
their store is located with respect to other stores under the same banner. However, there are still a
number of places in France, such as certain shopping centers, where both an Alain Afflelou store and
an Optical Discount store operate. Although these two banners target customers with different needs
and preferences, we may experience cannibalization of sales in surrounding stores following the
opening of a new store under either banner. An increased number of stores in a particular area or region
may result in the saturation of the market and the diversion of customers and sales from some of our
existing stores. Additionally, certain of our franchisees may become dissatisfied if other stores in the
networks were perceived as cannibalizing sales, leading to potential conflicts between franchisees as
well as potential conflicts between franchisees and us. Such conflict may result from the perception of
competition among franchisees operating under different banners in the same general area. Likewise,
if a franchise operating under one banner or brand provides inferior service to customers, it is possible
that this could create conflict among our franchisees and could negatively impact our franchisees.

In addition, we may not succeed in strategically expanding each of our banners through the opening of
new directly-owned or franchised stores. We may be unable to identify attractive new sites for stores,
based on demographics, proximity to locations of our existing stores, availability of suitable retail space
or local economic conditions. For example, we may not be able to diversify the types of stores in our
store networks in a way that perfectly follows changing shopping trends. The majority of the stores in
our historic networks are located in city centers, with fewer locations in shopping malls and suburban
retail zones that are currently popular retail destinations. Although we may want to open locations in
shopping malls or semi-urban retail parks, it may be difficult for us, as a franchisor whose development
is dependent on our franchisee network, to respond quickly to changing shopping trends as compared
to networks that primarily have directly-owned stores, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may also face difficulties in
finding new or existing franchisees to open or operate stores in specific geographic areas or may face
reluctance from existing franchisees which are not willing to assist us with the development of the
Optical Discount store network. As some of our franchisees retire, we may face difficulties in finding,
and transitioning stores to, new franchisees. If the management and development of our banners and
networks were to slow down, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of

53


-----

operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance that
macroeconomic conditions will not impair our or our franchisees' ability to obtain financing sources in
the future, including, but not limited to, our or our current or prospective franchisees' ability to incur
additional indebtedness to expand or open new stores or refurbish existing stores.

If we are unable to offer products, prices or commercial offers across our banners that are more
attractive than those of our competitors, we may lose market share or experience a decline in sales.
For example, we have observed that a growing number of customers in the optical product market are
price sensitive and, thus, the discount activity is an important growth driver. However, there are a
number of risks associated with our efforts to compete in the discount activity. Our discount banner may
not be able to successfully compete in this activity, which is already dominated by certain other large
players in France, such as Optical Center and Générale d'Optique. In addition, we may experience
difficulties introducing and expanding our Afflelou-Paris brand in emerging markets and our Alain
Afflelou Acousticien banner may fail to offer competitive pricing in line with other hearing aid product
retailers or to offer prices that are in line with our overall presentation of being "price-focused", due to
the high cost of hearing aid products as compared to optical products. Our failure to address these
challenges related to our multi-banner strategy may lead to general price decreases, reduced network
sales growth, reduced franchisor gross profit and a decline in our market share across some or all of
our banners, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

_We may be unable to successfully manage our digital transformation_

We are in the process of an ongoing digital transformation of our brand, which includes the development
and maintenance of a large and efficient customer database enabling stronger interaction with our
customers through digital tools, such as text and e-mails, a broader suite of digital tools that leverage
social networks in our communication, the use of high-tech devices, such as digital interactive screens
or tablets in our stores, and finally, a plan to grow on-line sales through our banners Alain Afflelou and
Optical Discount and Malentille.com.

This digital transformation represents a significant part of our planned capital expenditure and requires
a strong reinforcement of our teams in this activity. We may from time to time select suppliers or hire
personnel who are unable to conduct our plans, and thus delay our digital transformation. While digital
and high-tech solutions do not currently account for a significant portion of our activity, we believe these
development will play a greater role in the future, so that our retail network could be adversely affected
in the future if we fail to successfully implement this digital transformation.

_We are exposed to counterparty risks in relation to our customers, franchisees, suppliers and health_
_insurance companies._

We are and may become further exposed to risks of non-payment or late payment from customers,
franchisees, suppliers or OCAMs. In certain cases, when customers purchase optical products or
hearing aids from a store, their OCAM may pay the optician or audio prosthetist directly. As a
consequence, we may be exposed to a late payment risk from OCAMs for receivables in respect of a
large number of sales, both indirectly through our franchisees and directly through our directly-owned
stores. We also sometimes act as a qualified credit intermediary in certain of our markets (Belgium and
France), extending credit to end-customers for their purchases, which requires us to follow certain
regulations and comply with informational requirements and exposes us to further credit risk.
Additionally, we may in the future offer end-customers insurance for our products via third-party insurer,
which may expose us to counterparty risks from both insurers as well as our end customers.

We charge fees and commissions to franchisees in connection with the services we provide. Our central
purchasing units aggregate franchisee purchase orders of lenses and we make the related payments
to suppliers prior to collecting the contributions from franchisees. Although we have implemented
monitoring of our franchisees' financial performance and position, we are still exposed to risks on
accounts receivable in respect of payments owed by our franchisees. Furthermore, our ability to collect
royalties and communication fees is dependent on the solvency of our franchisees. Any loss or expense
incurred due to defaults by our customers, franchisees or suppliers could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Furthermore we provide guarantees to certain suppliers in relation to payments from franchisees, for
which we charge a del credere commission to suppliers benefiting from such a guarantee. We are
subject to default from franchisees on such payments, which are processed through our systems. We
also provide guarantees from time to time to financial institutions extending credit facilities to our

54


-----

franchisees. For further information on these guarantees, see "Business—Description of our business—
_Services that we provide as franchisor—Procurement, purchasing and logistics solutions" and_
_"Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—Guarantee facilities". All of the_
preceding factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects.

_The operation of our directly-owned stores requires us to incur fixed costs and to undertake investment_
_and operational risks associated with operating points of sale._

At January 31, 2021, we operated 77 directly-owned stores in France and 77 directly-owned stores in
Spain, and six directly-owned stores in Other countries (in Portugal). Directly-owned stores tend to have
a high level of fixed costs, including costs for personnel, leases, refurbishment and maintenance. We
lease our directly-owned stores from third parties. In addition, a number of our directly-owned stores
are flagship stores, which tend to be located in first-tier locations, such as the Champs-Élysées and
Forum des Halles of Paris. Such locations tend to be more expensive to operate and to lease than
ordinary retail locations. Furthermore, the success of any store depends in a substantial part on its
location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to be attractive as consumer
preferences and demographics change. The renewal of leases for certain stores may be difficult to
obtain and may require us to increase the amount spent on store leases or to find alternate locations
for our directly-owned stores. If we are unable to renew, replace or obtain new leaseholds for our
directly-owned stores (as applicable), our retail network strategy and expansion could be adversely
affected.

In order to optimize the management of our networks, occasionally we purchase and operate existing
franchised stores on a temporary basis, for instance to secure our position at a promising site, to ensure
that we do not lose a particularly attractive site in case of the retirement of a franchisee or transfer by a
franchisee of its rights in a store or to turn around an underperforming store. In other cases, we seek to
buttress our expansion in zones where we are not present, often to persuade new and existing
franchisees of an area's strong potential. Such stores can be operated for a time as directly-owned
stores before transitioning to franchisee ownership. However, we are exposed to the risk that it may not
be possible to transition such stores to franchisee ownership in a timely fashion or at all. In such cases,
we may be required to continue operating the store as a directly-owned store for longer than we had
initially planned or may have to close the store, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Operating retail stores exposes us to a number of other risks that are ancillary to such activity, including,
but not limited to theft and misappropriation of inventory or funds and/or events that disrupt ordinary
operation of directly-owned stores such as those caused by fire or flood. For more information about
our directly-owned stores, see "Business—Distribution channels—Development and management of
_our store networks—Directly-owned stores". The occurrence of any of these risks related to the_
operation of a significant number of directly-owned stores could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our marketing and communications strategy may prove ineffective._

Our network sales depend to some extent on the success of our communications strategy. We use
various platforms and media, such as events, television spots, online advertising, magazines, visual
merchandizing and social media, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube
and TikTok, to support the positioning of our brands and to engage with consumers. Maintaining
consumer engagement and keeping abreast of fashion trends requires significant investment, including
a dedicated team. Increases in competitors' communications expenditures could force us to similarly
increase our communications budget in the future and may materially impact our brand awareness and
footfall to our and our franchisees' stores, even if we match such competitors in terms of
communications spending. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in communications
spending will yield increases in brand awareness, footfall to our stores or traffic to our websites. For
more information about our marketing and communications strategy, see "Business—Products and
_commercial offers—Commercial offers and marketing strategy"._

From time to time, we have engaged with celebrity endorsers to draw attention to our products, a
practice which we may continue in the future. Our marketing campaigns featuring celebrities may not
be well-received by customers if the reputation of one of these celebrities has been undermined.
Additionally, we may not be successful in adapting to evolving communications tools. For example, if
we fail to successfully engage consumers on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok, or if any other element of our communications

55


-----

strategy fails, we could face a decrease in customer demand and a decline in sales, which could have
a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We may be unable to successfully introduce new product innovations and implement commercial offers._

Our historical success is attributable, in part, to the marketing of innovative optical products and hearing
aids that are perceived as reliable alternatives to products otherwise available in the market. Our future
success will depend on our continued ability to develop partnerships with optical and hearing aid
products suppliers and enter into distribution and licensing agreements with such suppliers to introduce
innovative products. In addition, we may not be able to continue devising and implementing unique
commercial offers to market our products. If we are unable to continue to introduce innovative products
and implement successful commercial offers, our future sales may decline which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Acquisitions or investments may disrupt our ongoing business, distract management and employees,_
_increase expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, we may not be able to identify suitable_
_acquisitions._

Historically, we have made acquisitions to fuel our growth strategy, penetrate new markets and drive
our expansion into the discount activity and the online sales space and we may continue to make such
acquisitions in the future.

Acquisitions entail inherent risks, particularly when they involve contingent or other liabilities, including
liabilities arising from events or conduct predating the acquisition, that were not known to us at the time
of acquisition. We may also acquire a company that does not perform as well as we expected, which
may not achieve profitability that is on par with the rest of our business or which may take significantly
longer than planned to achieve the results we initially expected. For example, we acquired Optimil in
July 2016. However we faced disappointing performance of the Optimil discount banner in Spain and
encountered difficulties in implementing the various components of the franchisor's offer in the Optimil
store network. We therefore decided to sell the Optimil banner in the course of the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2018 and completed the sale in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

As part of the integration of acquired companies into our networks, we may also incur significantly
greater expenditures than we had anticipated at the time of the acquisition, which may impair our ability
to achieve anticipated cost savings and synergies across our networks. Acquisitions may also have
unanticipated tax and accounting ramifications or tax disputes. For example, in December 2017, the
French tax authorities notified the Group of a tax reassessment amounting to €1.5 million (including
penalties and late payment interest) following an audit relating to VAT deducted by Optical Finance (the
franchisor operating the Optical Discount banner), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the period
from January 2014 to November 2016. See "Risks related to legal and regulatory matters—Risks
_related to disputes—We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings". Further, managers_
of the acquired companies may depart, which could delay our integration efforts or the execution of
such companies' commercial strategies.

Some of the risks associated with acquisitions relate to differences between the acquired business and
our legacy business. For example, following the acquisition of franchisor banners, we often become
party to legacy franchise agreements that differ from our standard forms, both in terms of franchisee
obligations and levels of remuneration. Likewise, the periodic reports delivered by franchisees that we
acquire may not be as in-depth as those provided by Alain Afflelou franchisees who are accustomed to
providing monthly reports. In addition, the franchisees that we have integrated or that we may integrate
in the future, may operate different sales systems or source their products in different ways than those
used by us, which could reduce operational synergies until such time as such legacy franchise
agreements can be renegotiated.

Additionally, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions
on acceptable terms, successfully integrate any acquired business into our networks, or retain an
acquired company's significant customer relationships, goodwill and key personnel or otherwise realize
the intended benefits of an acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_The occurrence of catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, pandemics or terrorist attacks, and_
_political instability could adversely affect our business._

The occurrence of catastrophic events and political instability could adversely affect our network sales.
Our supply and logistics chain is global, spanning several countries for the sourcing and distribution of

56


-----

our products. Catastrophic events such as natural disasters, floods, fires, earthquakes, severe weather,
pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks and armed conflicts in the countries in which we operate or
from which we source our products, could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the countries
where we operate or disrupt our supply and logistics chain. For example, the 2011 Thailand floods led
to delays and interruptions in deliveries from our Thai supplier. For more information, see "—We are
_exposed to political, economic and other business risks in our sourcing markets"._

More precisely, an event, such as a terrorist attack, political demonstrations or pandemics that either
reduce footfall to our and our franchisees' stores or impair our ability to receive products from our
suppliers, could substantially affect our business. These risks would be exacerbated if they were to
occur during peak shopping periods, such as the holiday shopping period. We cannot predict the extent
to which such events may affect our business, directly or indirectly, in the future. We also cannot assure
investors that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to
occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. A significant disruption at
our or our franchisees' stores or an interruption in our supply and logistics chain due to such catastrophic
events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects. For more information, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Recent regulatory changes and development"._

_The future expansion of our retail operations into new markets presents a number of risks._

Our management periodically evaluates expansion opportunities into new markets where we currently
do not operate against a number of commercial and financial criteria. Expansion into new markets and
development within our existing markets may take the form of organic growth, acquisitions of existing
networks or joint ventures or other partnerships, including by way of directly-owned stores or new
banners. Expansion into new markets is likely to carry greater risks than we face in our existing domestic
markets and such risks may be inherently higher if the expansion into new markets is made through
acquisitions. New markets may have different competitive and market conditions, regulatory
frameworks, customer preferences and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. We
may face political instability in new markets that we enter. For example, political troubles in Hong Kong
significantly affected our franchisee locally, leading to the closure of our franchised store in Hong Kong.
Furthermore, in the event of future confinements or other COVID-19-related measures that may be
implemented by the governments of the countries in which we operate, we may choose to put our
growth strategy on hold either in full or in part. We cannot predict whether, when, where and for how
long such confinement or other measures may be put in place in the future. As a result, we may not be
able to implement our growth plan in the short-, mid- or long-term, depending on the nature of such
confinements and other measures. We may also face higher costs of entry, reduced brand recognition,
logistical difficulties and minimal operating experience in such markets. Our product offering may not
be successful in new markets and our costs may increase due to cost overruns, unexpected delays or
other unforeseen factors. Improving brand recognition may be difficult in new markets where
competitors are already deeply entrenched, which may require us to make substantial investments in
areas such as merchandising, marketing, directly-owned store operations, website expansion and
enhancement, community relations, store aesthetics and graphics and employee training, which could
adversely affect our cash flow and which may ultimately not be successful. Any of these challenges
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

_Certain of our franchisees operate in emerging markets, and we are indirectly exposed to risks inherent_
_in transacting in such jurisdictions._

We believe that emerging markets present unique opportunities to position the Alain Afflelou brand as
a premium banner by building on our French heritage and distinctive own-branded products. However,
our product offering may not be well-received by local customers and, although expansion through
franchisees generally implies low capital requirements, we can provide no assurance that the benefits
of this strategy will outweigh the costs that we incur to form franchise relationships and build our brand
name in new markets. In addition, emerging market jurisdictions where we have expanded may have
less-protective legal frameworks for our trademarks. As our brand becomes more recognizable, the risk
of counterfeiting similarly increases, which could affect our brand integrity and our wholesale revenue.
Moreover, although our international franchise agreements require that the relevant franchisee make
payments in euro, royalties are set as a percentage of network sales, and therefore we are indirectly
exposed to the foreign exchange effect of such franchisee converting a portion of our network sales
into euro. Furthermore, we may be less able to exercise supervision and provide franchisor services to
franchisees located in emerging markets with differing regulatory systems, including with respect to

57


-----

customs and medical product purchases. As a result of the foregoing factors, our efforts in emerging
markets may be operationally complex and could be more costly than anticipated which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We may be required to remove or recall defective or unsafe products and may not have adequate_
_remedies against our suppliers for defective merchandise, which could harm our business and damage_
_our reputation and brand._

As the distributor of our products, we are liable for the safety of the products we sell, all of which are
manufactured and/or supplied by third parties. Product quality or safety concerns may require us to
remove certain products from our store networks and our websites. If the products that we purchase
from suppliers are damaged or prove to be defective, unsafe or of low quality, we may seek recourse
from our suppliers but we can offer no assurance that our suppliers will replace defective products in a
timely manner, provide us with refunds or sufficient indemnifications or that such incidents will be
covered by our product liability insurance.

Any failure by our suppliers to adhere to product safety or manufacturing safety standards could result
in serious product defects that may not be detected by our quality control procedures and which may in
turn lead to product recalls. Although there have historically been no significant recalls with respect to
our products, there can be no assurance that a product recall will not occur in the future. Our reputation
and brand could be damaged by the marketing of defective products, especially in the event of serious
defects, such as the sale of products incorporating harmful substances causing physical harm or injury
or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in network sales.
In addition, we may be exposed to compliance lapses by our suppliers, which could lead to investigation
by agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions
could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. Any such event, especially if it
results in a prolonged impact on product quality, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We may incur significant repair or replacement costs in respect of product guarantees._

The stores in our networks provide certain product guarantees to customers, both as a result of
contractual and legal provisions and for marketing purposes, which permits customers to be reimbursed
for products that do not perform as expected. The term of the guarantee provided depends on the
product, but typically runs for three years from the date of the purchase for products that we market
under our own Afflelou brand, two years for other optical products (except for "Égérie" progressive
lenses which can be adapted for fit within the first three months) and for life for certain optical products
such as "Protect" lenses. Existing and future product guarantees place our directly-owned stores and
our franchisees at the risk of incurring future repair and/or replacement costs. If the amounts or
frequency of product guarantee claims were to increase significantly, such as due to a decrease in
product quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects.

_We are exposed to liability and reputational harm from injury at our directly-owned stores as well as our_
_franchisees' stores._

Part of our strategy is to create retail spaces that encourage customers to spend time in the stores in
our networks and get to know our products. We and our franchisees are therefore exposed to the risk
of liability from lawsuits or reputational harm if customers are injured at a store in our networks, either
through no fault on our part or that of our franchisees or due to unsafe conditions caused by, among
other factors, crowded conditions or the failure to use adequate care in stocking the shelves or installing
in-store displays. We may also fail to grant our employees and customers adequate protection from
COVID-19 through protocols implemented at store-level, including limits on the number of people in a
store at one time, strict protocol for handling and sanitizing merchandise, frequent sterilization of tools,
increased attention to hygiene and encouraging use of appointments for store visits by customers. While
such occurrences are rare, any liability, reputational damage or negative publicity resulting from such
injuries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition
and prospects.

_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._

We carry insurance of various types, including general business liability insurance, franchisor civil
liability insurance, fraud and cyber insurance, transport insurance and directors' and officers' civil liability
insurance and insurance for our directly-owned stores. We may not be able to accurately foresee future

58


-----

activities in which we may engage in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our
insurance policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by our insurance in specific instances. While
we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all claims are necessarily covered by insurance
and we may experience major incidents of a nature that are not covered by insurance. Furthermore,
the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year
could have a material adverse effect on our insurance premiums. In addition, our insurance premiums
may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material
price increases in the insurance market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current
insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost. All of the factors listed above could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our business may be disrupted if our information systems fail or if our databases are destroyed or_
_damaged._

We, our franchisees and our suppliers rely on several information technology tools, platforms, systems
and databases across our and their operations, mainly to support and monitor our and their networks,
establish reporting, invoicing, the management of central purchasing units and the central listing and
payment unit and various other processes and transactions. For instance, we use common point-ofsale software to operate our directly-owned stores. This point-of-sale software is critical to the daily
operation of our directly-owned stores and the number of point-of-sale terminals we have in operation
at a given time is limited. If these point-of-sale terminals were to become inoperative for any reason,
we would not be able to quickly replace them. Our ability to effectively manage our operations and
coordinate our interactions with our customers, suppliers and franchisees depends on, among other
things, the reliability of these systems' tools. Our e-commerce operations rely heavily on such
information systems and are exposed to certain additional risks related to the computer systems and
related support systems pursuant to which our websites are operated, such as liability for online content
and breach of data privacy. More generally, we are exposed to risks related to computer viruses and
malware, cyberattacks, electronic break-ins and similar problems. For example, in July 2017, Optical
Discount experienced a brief attack on its computer systems. Any failure by us or our third-party
providers to update and secure their systems or products, any disruption of their operations, any failure
of our information systems to operate effectively, or any breach in data security causing unintentional
disclosure of customer or other confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to our hearing aid business_**

_The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is particularly important for sales of our_
_hearing aids in France._

Prices of hearing aids are generally high. For example, in France in 2019, the average cost of hearing
aids was €1,555 per ear (and can exceed €1,800 per ear), according to GfK, and was estimated to be
€1,545 by Xerfi in 2020. Thus, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-parties such as the
public health system and OCAMs, which reduces the out-of-pocket cost paid by the end customer, is
important for obtaining product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace. Less than half
of the cost of hearing aids is currently reimbursable in France through the public health system and
OCAMs, and the recently-introduced regime known as 100% Santé, introduced by the French Health
Ministry, should improve the relative proportion of reimbursements up to full coverage for certain
devices. Nevertheless, any cost-cutting initiatives implemented by public or private health insurance
schemes in the countries in which we operate that reduce the level of reimbursement available to
consumers could negatively affect demand for our hearing aids. We expect that government regulation
and third-party coverage and reimbursement policies will continue to limit the amounts that governments
and other third parties will pay for healthcare products and services, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For more
information, see "—Risks related to the French healthcare system—We are exposed to risk relating to
_the reimbursement framework in France" and "Recent Developments—Changes in the regulatory_
_environment"_

Prices for hearing aids have historically been subject to price erosion. The price of hearing aids
decreases once a product has been on the market for two to three years. As a result, evolving
technologies and rapid innovation in the hearing aid market place significant pressure on prices,
especially on products equipped with an older technology. While we believe that volume growth in
France should partially offset declines in prices in the future, any reversal in that trend could increase

59


-----

the extent to which pricing pressure impacts our revenue and the revenue of our franchisees and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to our supply activities_**

_We and our franchisees rely significantly on certain suppliers and service providers._

The manufacturing of our own-brand and exclusively licensed products could be delayed or temporarily
or permanently interrupted. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities or equipment and
therefore depends entirely upon third parties for the manufacturing of such products. The majority of
the products that we sell are supplied from third parties located in Asia. Certain Asian countries in which
our suppliers are located, namely China and Thailand, have both been affected, and may be affected
in the future, by political and economic disturbances, natural disasters and labor shortages, which could
impair the ability of our suppliers to fulfill our orders and those of our franchisees. If we experience a
surge in demand or the need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional
manufacturing capacity will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. There is also a risk
that production by one or more manufacturers could be suspended or delayed, temporarily or
permanently, due to economic or technical problems such as the insolvency of the manufacturer, the
failure of the manufacturing facilities or disruption of the production process, all of which are beyond
our control.

We do not maintain warehousing facilities. We outsource all of our warehousing and delivery logistics
to third parties and rely on third-party suppliers to supply us and our franchisees with products in a
timely fashion in order to meet demand from both customers and franchisees. If these services are
interrupted or delayed for any significant period of time or if any of these third-party providers fails to
fulfill any of their responsibilities, our image and reputation may suffer. This could lead to the
deterioration of our relationships with potential and existing franchisees and customers.

All of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects.

_We rely significantly on an intermediary agent in China._

We source most of our proprietary frames and sunglasses that are sold under our Afflelou brand, as
well as frames and sunglasses that we sell under exclusive licenses through a Chinese intermediary
agent, Okia. Okia sources its products from subcontractors and manufacturers with whom we have no
contact. Okia or its subcontractors could experience financial and operational impediments, such as
difficulties in their supply and logistics chain, including delivery delays and stock disruptions or social
unrest that could interfere with access to products and are exposed to risks inherent to doing business
in China. The reliance on Okia could also impair our ability to execute our business plan within the
desired timeframe if Okia were to fail to meet our requirements. In addition, any problem pertaining to
the quality of products sourced by Okia or linked to the manufacturing conditions of our products in
China (notably relating to compliance with national, international and European regulations on working
conditions) may trigger negative publicity, adversely affect our reputation and result in loss of market
share, especially as some of our competitors use the fact that they manufacture their products in France
as a sales argument.

Furthermore, Okia may increase the fees it charges us for its services or may abruptly cease working
with us, including due to factors beyond our or Okia's control. In the event that we are not able to
continue to rely on Okia, we may experience difficulties and delays in finding a new agent that meets
our standards and allows us to source products in a timely and efficient manner. Even if we do identify
a new agent, we may experience increased costs or significant delays in souring as we transition to
such new agent. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. Given our long-standing relationship with Okia, our commercial
agreements with Okia are not systematically documented and formalized. In the event of disagreements
or litigation with Okia, the absence of legally binding documents may hinder our ability to enforce our
rights under those agreements and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations, financial condition and prospects, particularly in light of Okia's importance in our
supply and logistics chain. All the preceding factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

60


-----

_Our business may be adversely affected by the loss of, or actions taken by, our suppliers and changes_
_to our contractual agreements and license agreements._

Our suppliers currently provide us with various revenue streams such as listing and del credere
commissions on franchisee purchases, as well as early payment allowances. Suppliers that are
selected to manufacture products sold under one of our signature brands, or in the context of one of
our commercial offers, are also invoiced licensing fees based on the purchases of such products by
franchisees. In addition, we retain a share of the discounts and rebates negotiated with suppliers when
reselling products to franchisees, mainly through the central purchasing unit. We may not be able to
continue to retain or find new qualified suppliers who meet our standards and levels of demand and
supply products in a timely and efficient manner.

Our suppliers may challenge the fees or discounts that are applied to them, decide to withdraw some
of the services they offer or alter the commercial terms, conditions, discounts and rebates we have
negotiated with them. We may also be adversely affected if our suppliers consolidate, thereby
increasing their bargaining power, or if competitors sign exclusive supply agreements with or take over
our current or future suppliers, diverting their manufacturing capacity away from servicing our needs. In
addition, certain of our suppliers enjoy commanding market positions and we may be unable to secure
products of sufficient quality or quantity if any such supplier ceases trading, demands higher prices or
more stringent payment terms, is unable to meet our requirements or reduces its business with us for
any other reason. Even if we do identify new suppliers, we may experience increased costs, delays and
product shortages as we transition our product requirements to alternative suppliers. Such new
arrangements may not be on terms that are as favorable to us as our current arrangements. Finally,
any new supplier with which we do business may be subject to similar or even greater quality- and
quantity-related risks as our existing suppliers.

Additionally, from time to time, we have exclusive licenses for certain brands, for which the Group has
an exclusive license, pursuant to which we source and distribute frames that are marketed under those
brands. We may also from time to time market exclusive collections from designer brands, which are
branded frames specifically created by designers for exclusive distribution by our networks. For more
information about our licensing agreements, see "Business—Research and development, patents and
_licenses". Changes to or termination of our exclusive licenses or if we encounter difficulties in obtaining_
new exclusive designer brand licenses, this may divert customers to competitors and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We are exposed to political, economic and other business risks in our sourcing markets._

Most of our products are manufactured in markets outside the European Union, principally in China,
Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia. We face a variety of risks generally associated with
doing business in foreign markets and importing products from these markets, including, among others,
political and economic instability, increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods,
imposition of duties or other charges and restrictions on imports, currency and exchange rate risks,
exchange controls, delays in shipping and increased costs of transportation, risks related to labor
practices and disputes, non-compliance with product safety or manufacturing safety standards,
environmental matters, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes or other specific problems in
the countries in which our products are manufactured. For example, political troubles in Hong Kong
significantly affected our franchisee locally, leading to the closure of our franchised store in Hong Kong.
Any such risk which disrupts the production of our suppliers, increases costs and/or delivery times and
could result in increased costs for us or impact our ability to adequately supply our points-of-sale. The
occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

**Risks related to legal and regulatory matters**

**_Risks related to disputes_**

_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings._

In the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various claims, lawsuits,
investigations, arbitration and administrative proceedings, such as, for instance, antitrust or tax
proceedings, some of which may involve substantial claims for damages.

We are subject to certain antitrust proceedings. For example, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, is involved in
a proceeding initiated by the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) in relation to
certain anticompetitive practices concerning the prices of certain frames. In July 2016, the French

61


-----

Competition Authority set a sanction of up to €12.5 million. The proceedings are ongoing and we are
contesting the allegations. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the French Competition
Authority may impose a fine, including in an amount in excess of the above mentioned maximum. As of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, no provision has been set aside in the Issuer's consolidated
accounts for this proceeding. We also cannot exclude the fact that a possible sanction from the French
Competition Authority could cause us to incur liability for damages to third parties. As of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, no provision has been set aside in the Issuer's consolidated accounts for this
proceeding. See "Business—Legal And arbitration proceedings—Proceeding concerning alleged
_antitrust practices as the result of a vertical agreement concerning the price of frames"._

We are also subject to tax proceedings in France.

  - In December 2017, the Group received a notice of a proposed reassessment from the French
tax authorities following an audit relating to VAT deduction made by Optical Finance (the
franchisor operating the Optical Discount banner), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the
period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2016. The French tax authorities concluded that
Optical Finance participated in a VAT tax evasion scheme during such period. The French tax
authorities' reassessment included adjustments amounting to €1.5 million (€966,000 in tax
reassessment, €386,000 in penalties and €134,000 in late payment interest). Following receipt
of the tax authorities' confirmed reassessment for the full amount on August 16, 2018, the
Group provisionally decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal of the reassessment
(€966,000). However, we believe that the French tax authorities' position is unfounded and
decided to challenge the decision. On March 5, 2019, the French tax authorities rejected the
challenge. Therefore, we decided to contest this decision before the French administrative
tribunal of Paris and thus filed a claim on March 29, 2019. The Group also exercised its call
option pursuant to the vendor warranties issued by the vendor's shareholders relating to its
acquisition of Optical Finance (such vendor warranties being however capped at €1 million).

  - Alain Afflelou Franchiseur was subject to a tax audit for the period from August 1, 2009 to July
31, 2012. As a result of this audit, the French tax authorities issued a tax reassessment notice
mainly reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain holdings in 2010,
claiming that such sale price should have been higher in order to be considered as having been
made at arm's length. As we believe there are robust arguments to challenge the position of
the French tax authorities, we filed a claim with the French lower administrative court on
December 28, 2018, which was rejected by the French tax authorities and thus led us to file a
request with the French administrative court of Montreuil on March 11, 2021.

  - In December 2018, we received a notice of a proposed reassessment of our income tax for the
fiscal years ended July 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 from the French tax authorities. This proposed
reassessment relates to the deduction of interest charges relating to the 14% interest rate on
convertible bonds issued by 3ABOD (which now sit at the level of the Issuer) (i.e. the
Shareholder Bonds) in July 2012 for an amount of €203.3 million, in relation to the acquisition
of the Group by the Sponsors. The French tax authorities consider, on the grounds of the abuse
of law theory, that the interest on the Shareholder Bonds should not have been deducted from
the corporate tax, to the extent the Shareholder Bonds qualify as an equity financing by the
main shareholders, and correspond to dividend distributions. Based on legal advice, we have
contested this proposed reassessment in a response sent to the French tax authorities in
February 2019. On March 30, 2021, the French tax authorities confirmed however that the
reassessment was maintained and that the case could be referred to the tax abuse committee
(Comité de l'abus de droit fiscal). We intend to submit our case to the opinion of the tax law
abuse committee. In addition, in March 2021, the French tax authorities launched a second tax
audit with respect to the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses carried forward amounted to €65.4 million as of January
31, 2021. According to our preliminary estimates, if the French tax authorities were to prevail concerning
the second and third disputes discussed above, it could result in both (i) a reduction of the amount of
tax losses carried forward for an amount (estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum) of
deferred tax assets of approximately €58 million and (ii) the payment of (x) income taxes for the years
subject to tax reassessment or tax audit as well as the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year (i.e., from
August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021) and (y) related penalties for a maximum total estimated amount
as of the date hereof of approximately €21 million based on the current status of the procedure. We
dispute the findings of the French tax administration and intend to challenge the administration's position
in the next coming weeks. However, we cannot predict the timing or the final outcome of this challenge

62


-----

or more generally the above proceedings and we cannot guarantee that the ultimate tax impacts for the
Group will not differ from the amounts referred to above. Furthermore, the Group may face an additional
tax burden in respect of future fiscal years depending on the outcome of the dispute with the tax
administration and the position retained by the Group on the tax treatment of the interest on the
Shareholder Bonds.

Additionally, from time to time we are subject to litigation from current and former franchisees, and have
in the past been required to pay damages in suits for wrongful termination of franchisee licenses, for
example.

Additionally, these risks are heightened by the COVID-19 situation. We have taken extensive measures
to protect our customers and our workforce, in order to minimize their exposure to COVID-19. However,
we cannot be certain that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 and
we may be subject to potential litigation as a result of customers or our personnel who contract, or
believe they have contracted, the virus at our stores. We may also be subject to potential litigation
initiated by employees alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have
increased their exposure to COVID-19. We may also be at risk of litigation following a possible outbreak
at one of our stores, which may cause us to incur further significant costs and which may have a
negative impact on our reputation. Any such fines or claims may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. For further information, see "—Risks
related to macroeconomic conditions—The negative impact of COVID-19 on our business is significant
and its effects will continue to materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results
of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control".

Adverse judgments or determinations in one or more of these proceedings may require us to change
the way we do business or use substantial resources in adhering to settlements or pay damages, fines
or other penalties. The costs related to such proceedings may be significant and even if there is a
positive outcome, we may still have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they
are not reimbursable by other litigants, insurance or otherwise. In addition, provisions we make when
threatened with actual or potential litigation may prove insufficient. For further information, see
"Business—Legal and arbitration proceedings". These proceedings, inquiries or disputes could
undermine our brand and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_Risks related to laws and regulations_**

_We operate in a highly regulated business environment and predicting legal and regulatory changes or_
_developments is difficult._

Our ability to predict and adapt to changing legal and regulatory trends is important to our success. Any
uncertainty as to regulatory trends or changes in policies in relation to our industry may delay or hinder
our ability to achieve our strategic plans or increase the cost of implementing such plans. The sale of
our products and the provision of our services are subject to a high level of regulation and oversight,
including regulation applicable to the healthcare sector. The main regulatory requirements relevant to
our business include the public health system and complementary health insurance reimbursement
systems, recruitment and appointment of personnel, distribution channels and agreements, and
limitations on advertising (for more information about regulations that apply to our business, see
"Regulation"). We are also subject to commercial, antitrust, labor, tax, consumer and consumer finance
regulations and other provisions. Regulatory requirements differ across the jurisdictions in which we
operate and are subject to change. New regulations may be introduced in the future, and existing
regulations and regulatory bodies may be amended, significantly expanded or replaced. We may be
required to adapt our operations in order to comply with such changes.

We may not be able to predict the content of new legislation and regulations and their effects on our
business and we may not be able to adapt to regulations sufficiently quickly, or at a reasonable cost.
Our operations may be adversely affected by regulatory developments and the cost of compliance with
new regulations may be material. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material
adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

In addition, a number of public statements made by the current French administration may result in the
eventual adoption of new regulations that could be implemented to the detriment of our business,
particularly in regards to third-party payment systems and potential limits on out-of-pocket expenses
paid for optical products and hearing aids.

See also "—Risks related to the French healthcare system—We are exposed to risk relating to the
_reimbursement framework in France"._

_We are exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial action._

We and our franchisees may experience lengthy consultations with labor unions and works councils,
strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation of new collective
bargaining agreements or salary increases in the future, which could disrupt our operations or increase
costs. In addition, strikes by employees of any of our key suppliers or services contractors could result
in business interruptions. The occurrence of any of the above risks could disrupt our business, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

_We may fail to obtain, renew or maintain, or may experience material delays in obtaining, requisite_
_governmental or other relevant approvals, licenses, certificates or permits for the conduct of our_
_business._

Our activities require various approvals, licenses and certificates to sell frames and lenses, contact
lenses, prescription sunglasses and hearing aids. We may encounter significant obstacles or delays in
obtaining or renewing, or be unable to obtain or renew, new or existing approvals, licenses and
certificates required for the conduct of our business, in particular in markets in which we have only
recently established a presence, or that we will continue to satisfy the conditions under which such
approvals, licenses and certificates are granted. Although we monitor the status of approvals, licenses
and certificates in markets in which we carry out our activities and proactively file applications to retain
or obtain such approvals, licenses and certificates, there may be delays on the part of the regulatory,
administrative or other relevant bodies in reviewing our applications and granting such approvals,
licenses and certificates. In certain countries, the procedures for acquiring or renewing approvals,
licenses and certificates may become more complicated and/or costly. If we fail to obtain, renew or
maintain the necessary approvals, licenses and certificates required for the conduct of our business,
we may lose customers or be required to incur substantial costs, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Our relationships with our customers and suppliers are subject to stringent regulations._

The relationships between stores in our networks and customers are governed by consumer protection
laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. Such regulations are designed to ensure the
protection of customers, and generally include requirements that market players act fairly and provide
customers with complete information to enable them to make free and informed purchasing decisions.
In addition, our relationships with our suppliers are subject to specific regulations governing, for
instance, disclosure requirements, fair dealing, ordering, delivery, pricing, invoicing, payment and
intellectual property.

Failure on our part or on the part of our franchisees to comply with applicable laws and regulations
governing our and our franchisees' relationships with customers and suppliers may result in
investigations, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and administrative or legal proceedings. In
addition, a failure to comply with regulations governing our relationships with our suppliers may entitle
the relevant supplier to terminate our business dealings with us. Any of these developments may
undermine our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We are subject to stringent security and data privacy laws and may be exposed to confidentiality and_
_security breaches._

We and our franchisees are subject to complex and evolving European, French, Spanish and other
laws and regulations regarding the collection, retention, sharing and protection of data obtained from
and concerning end customers, as well as their employees and, for us, the franchisees themselves. In
France, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés is the competent data protection
authority. Since entry into force of the GDPR, we have not had to make any filings with or request
authorizations from such authority (except in respect of certain very limited exceptions). The GDPR
requires that companies that handle personal data adhere to the GDPR's principles relating to
processing of personal data and comply with certain recordkeeping and processing requirements and
be able to demonstrate compliance with the aforementioned requirements to data protection authorities
upon request. In addition to the GDPR, French data protection law no. 78-17 dated 6 January 1978, as
modified, applies in France. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and any new

64


-----

requirements may result in modifications of our business practices and increased cost of operations to
meet such requirements.

In addition, opticians and audio prosthetists in our networks receive and store confidential, personal
and sensitive data, such as medical, social security and other health insurance information with respect
to customers, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the use and
disclosure of health and personal information. As such, we receive and store this data from our directlyowned and franchisee stores. The amount of such data has increased following the implementation of
our CRM program.

_Our sales operations are also subject to changing regulations and laws governing online, e-commerce_
_and in-person transactions, including user privacy and e-privacy, data protection and electronic_
_communications laws and regulations, including the GDPR._

In December 2015, the EU approved the GDPR with respect to data protection. The GDPR enhanced
existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties (up to the greater of
€20 million and 4% of the global turnover) for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR became
directly applicable in all EU member states on May 25, 2018, and to all other European Economic Area
states thereafter. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, on January 11, 2017, the EU
Commission published a proposal for an e-privacy regulation, replacing the existing e-privacy directive
that regulated privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Discussions for the
adoption of the e-privacy regulations are ongoing, on the basis of the latest proposal agreed upon on
February 10, 2021 by the Council of the European Union.

Further, customers expect us and our franchisees to adequately protect their personal information. If
we, our franchisees, opticians or audio prosthetists in our networks do not adequately safeguard
confidential customer data or other protected health information, or if such information or data are
wrongfully used by us or our franchisees, if such data is disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity
or if we or our franchisees fail to comply with privacy laws and regulations or data protection policies
with respect to our customers, employees or franchisees, our reputation may suffer, and we may be
subject to fines, penalties and legal proceedings (including criminal sanctions under the French Criminal
Code) and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. As of January 31, 2021, we are not aware of any material non-compliance or
investigations in relation to our data retention activities. However, even though we have made make
extensive efforts to comply with data protection laws and requirements, we cannot ensure that we will
not be subject to regulatory and/or private action nor that security breaches involving for instance
customer transaction data will not occur. Any breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the
security of our websites and deter future purchases.

_Changes in laws and regulations affecting the advertising methods we employ or the commercial offers_
_we implement may adversely affect our ability to promote our brand and market our products._

We rely heavily on our communications, marketing and advertising strategies through the Internet and
national media, including television, to promote our brand and commercial offers in our main markets.
Changes in regulations restricting television advertisement by healthcare professionals, including
opticians, may substantially impact our ability to promote our brand, commercial offers and product
offerings. Depending on the classification of the applicable product, legislation in France and Spain
currently imposes limits on content and/or requires pre-publication review of the content by the
competent authorities. Currently, only contact lenses and contact lens solutions are subject to such
regulation. However, such regulations may change in the future. Moreover, changes in regulations
affecting our commercial strategy may impair our ability to conduct certain of our commercial offers. For
instance, the regulation of consumer credit may tighten, which may hinder the continued success of our
NextYear commercial offer, which allows customers to purchase our products on credit and free of
interest and other charges. Likewise, regulatory changes that limit customer out-of-pocket spending on
certain optical products and hearing aids may reduce the attractiveness of certain of our commercial
offers, such as NextYear, which we use to draw new and returning customers to our stores. For more
information about our commercial offers, see "Business—Consumer financing solutions". This could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_Changes in customs regulations, including customs duties, may adversely affect our operations._

Our business relies on our effective supply strategy. Our main supplier, which supplies the majority of
frames and sunglasses that we market under our own brands, is Okia (see "Business—Sourcing,
_branding and manufacturing"). In addition, our suppliers of exclusive collections from designer brands,_

65


-----

own-brand lenses and contact lenses and non-exclusive products manufacture or source products from
countries which are not members of the European Union. Due to our significant import activities, we are
subject to changes in customs regulations, and particularly customs duties. Our and our franchisees'
purchasing costs may be adversely affected if export and import regulations in the countries from which
we or our suppliers source products, or import regulations in the European Union, become more
stringent or costly. For instance, our and our franchisees' purchasing costs may be affected by an
increase in the amount of customs duties that we or our suppliers are required to pay. We may be
unable to pass on any additional costs associated with more stringent customs regulations to
franchisees and our franchisees may be unable to pass on such costs to end customers. As a result,
any changes in customs regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations, financial condition and prospects.

_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations_
_applicable in the countries in which we operate or intend to operate._

We must comply with certain anti-corruption laws, sanctions and other similar regulations. For example,
the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the French Criminal Code
and law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic
life (more widely known as the "Sapin II Law") and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit
companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials and/or private
counterparts for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and require the implementation of an
anti-bribery compliance program. We operate in certain parts of the world that lack a developed legal
system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with
anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate
compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts, we cannot assure
you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our
employees.

Further, due to the global nature of our operations, we may use local agents or subcontractors to
understand unfamiliar environments and differences in cultural, legal, financial and accounting
complexities and obligations, or to carry out a portion of the activities called for by a particular contract.
There is a risk that such agents or subcontractors may be involved in illegitimate activities in local
markets that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately supervise them or maintain an adequate
compliance program, we may be liable for their actions. Similarly, our franchisees and our suppliers
may be involved in activities that our onboarding and diligence procedures may be unable to detect and
that may put us at risk for non-compliance with anti-corruption and similar laws.

Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges,
injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts,
revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could
also negatively impact our reputation and consequently negatively impact our business. On the other
hand, any such violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair advantage when
bidding for contracts. The consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks related to our financial profile, capital structure and tax**

**_Risks related to our financial profile and capital structure_**

_Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when_
_making an investment decision._

In this Offering Memorandum, we present Normalized EBITDA, which is derived using various
assumptions related to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our EBITDA. See "Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information" for additional details_
regarding these adjustments to our Normalized EBITDA and their underlying assumptions.

The assumptions we have made with respect to the Normalized EBITDA that we present in this Offering
Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
anticipated future results, performance or achievements implied by such adjusted financial information.

Specifically, to derive the Normalized EBITDA, we have replaced the two fiscal quarters spanning the
first confinement period in France and Spain (March 17 to May 11, 2020) during which all of our stores

66


-----

were closed and the Group generated only minimal EBITDA with the comparable quarters from fiscal
year 2019, which was not impacted by COVID-19. For purposes of estimating the impact of IFRS 16 on
our Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019, the Group has used the amount of rents
associated with operating leases for the six months ended July 31, 2020 (€7.5 million) for the adjusted
amount, as compared to €7.7 million for the six months ended July 31, 2019. However, such IFRS 16
adjustment does not reflect any increases or decreases in the amount of rents during the six months
ended July 31, 2020 as compared to the six months ended July 31, 2019, as a result of the evolution
of the number of directly owned stores, any annual rent increases or any reductions in rent due to
COVID-19.

In addition, Normalized EBITDA does not (i) give effect to any other event, favorable or unfavorable,
that happened or could have happened during the six months ended July 31, 2020, other than the
events directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the negative impact of the reduction under
100% Santé of the maximum frame reimbursement rate from €150 to €100 and the implementation of
the zero-out-of-pocket offer (set at approximately €100 for a pair of unifocal prescription glasses) or (ii)
adjust for the positive or negative effect of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the six months
ended January 31, 2021, in particular the significant positive impact of the increased demand for our
products during periods immediately following the reopening of our stores after the end of confinement
measures, as well as the negative impact of further restrictive measures which have been implemented
by the governments in the countries in which we operate, notably in November 2020 and January 2021
in France, in response to the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As a result, we cannot assure you that the difference between the Adjusted EBITDA for the six months
ended July 31, 2020 and the Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended July 31, 2019 may not be
partly due to factors other than the COVID-19 pandemic, such as overall market trends and conditions
or competitive pressures we are facing, and there is no guarantee that any such difference is
recoverable or will be recovered by our business in future periods.

You should exercise caution when evaluating the adjustments reflected in the Normalized EBITDA and
whether you consider these to be appropriate, as this information is inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties. Normalized EBITDA has not been audited or independently reviewed by our auditors. It
should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our
performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity.

While we use Normalized EBITDA to assess our operating performance, and we believe that similar
measures are commonly used by investors, we cannot guarantee that Normalized EBITDA, as
presented in this Offering Memorandum, is comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
companies, due to, among other things, differences in the way such measures are calculated.

_A substantial amount of our total assets consists of intangible assets, including trademarks and_
_goodwill, and we may be required to record significant impairment charges in respect of these assets._

In accordance with IFRS, our management must test certain assets for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets subject to
testing include goodwill and intangible assets such as the value of our trademarks and customer lists.
In addition, our management must test for impairment of goodwill at least once a year, whether or not
there are any indicators of impairment. IFRS require us to recognize a non-cash charge in an amount
equal to any impairment. As of January 31, 2021, intangible assets susceptible to impairment charges
under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets represented 73.3% (post-IFRS 16) including rights of use of our
total assets. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may result in material
reductions of our revenue and equity under IFRS. This could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

_The Issuer is a holding company and will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to_
_be able to make payments on the Notes._

The Issuer is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant
assets other than the shares it holds in the Subsidiary Guarantors and its receivables under the Notes
Proceeds Loans and any future intercompany loans. As a result, the Issuer is dependent upon the cash
flow from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, intercompany loans, or otherwise to make any
payments due on the Notes. In addition, the Issuer's subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds
to the Issuer under some circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions
under French or other applicable corporate law, and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions
in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay

67


-----

dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also subject such
payments to taxation. We cannot assure you that the arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding
permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our
results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or
loans to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments
from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes,
and we do not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to
holders of the Notes.

_The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of the Notes._

The Sponsors are the indirect majority shareholders of the Issuer. The interests of the Sponsors and/or
any other principal shareholder in the future could conflict with each other and/or the interests of the
holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our liabilities
when due. Any principal shareholder could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in its judgment could enhance its
investment, although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. In addition, our
shareholders may also invest or acquire businesses that compete with us. Our shareholders have no
contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business if
we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indentures will permit us to pay management fees,
dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and our main shareholders
may have an interest in us doing so. In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants under
the Indentures, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other agreements governing our
indebtedness, we will depend upon the cooperation of the Sponsors who have the power to control
decisions with respect to the Group and influence compliance with such covenants. For example, our
shareholders could vote to cause us or one of our subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, to sell
certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the covenants governing our
indebtedness so permit.

**_Risks related to tax_**

_Changes in tax laws or challenges to our tax position could adversely affect our results of operations_
_and financial condition._

We are subject to complex tax laws in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as
international tax laws. Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely
affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments.

Our tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law.
Certain tax positions we take are based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some
cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described
in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax
context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty
relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including
tax base. It is possible that the tax authorities will not agree with the views we have taken. From time to
time, we are subject to tax audits, and any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our
application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable
income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are
made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have
an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to
varying interpretations. In this respect, the incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development's ( the "OECD") principles related to base erosions and profit
shifting ("BEPS") included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral
Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS signed in Paris on June 7,
2017 could increase the administrative efforts within the Group and impact existing structures.

In parallel, the European Union intends to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this
respect, on July 12, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted a new EU Directive (Council
Directive 2016/1164) laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the
functioning of the internal market (the "ATAD"). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the
Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the "ATAD 2"), which, inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to

68


-----

hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain
exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest
limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the
taxpayer's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum
amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions) (Article 4 of the ATAD). Such
rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law. The French Finance
Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also introduced under French tax law the
provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article
212-I-b of the French Code général des impôts (the "French Tax Code"). See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and Our Capital Structure—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for_
_French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus_
_reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness"._

Furthermore, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the antiabuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to
address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this
provision, the French tax authorities might ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which,
having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax
advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine taking into
account all relevant facts and circumstances.

The European Commission has also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25,
2016 including three new proposals that aim at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate
Tax Base ("CCCTB") which is a single set of rules to compute companies' taxable profits in the EU,
(ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU
countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for
businesses. The directive proposal on the CCCTB requires unanimity in the Council of the European
Union for its adoption following consultation of the European Parliament (special legislative procedure),
which gave its favorable vote on March 15, 2018. It is expected to be implemented in two steps, with
the common base being implemented as a first step and consolidation being put in place swiftly
afterwards. In this respect, in the European Commission's 2020 work program, it was stated that the
CCCTB should receive priority attention in 2020. However, as of today, it appears that no further
progress has been made on this program. Furthermore, additional rules on tax dispute resolution apply
since January 1, 2019 following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017
into French tax law as part of the 2019 French Finance Law. These regulations could impact our tax
position in the future.

Finally, since tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions in which the Group's companies are
located, or operate, or may be located, or may operate, may not always provide clear-cut or definitive
guidelines, the tax regime applied to the Group's operations, intra-group transactions or reorganizations
(past or future) is or may sometimes be based on the Issuer's interpretations of French, Luxembourg or
foreign tax laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be questioned
by the relevant tax authorities. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations of
the countries in which the Group's companies are located or operate may result in reassessments, late
payment interests, fines and penalties.

_Our future results, French and foreign tax regulations and tax audits or disputes could limit our ability to_
_use our tax loss carryforwards and, as a result, could have an impact on our financial condition._

We have carryforward tax losses (€273.3 million in total, of which €267.1 million relate to France as of
July 31, 2020) including €245.5 million of carryforward tax losses generated within the current French
tax consolidated group. Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses carried forward amounted to €65.4
million as of January 31, 2021. The ability to effectively use such carryforward tax losses depends on a
variety of factors, including: (i) the ability to generate taxable income and the adequacy between such
income and tax losses; (ii) the general limitation applicable to French carryforward tax losses, under
which the percentage of carryforward tax losses that may be used to offset the portion of taxable income
exceeding €1 million is limited to 50%, as well as certain specific restrictions relating to the use of certain
categories of carryforward tax losses; (iii) limitations to the use of tax losses that may be imposed by
foreign laws and regulations (e.g., in case of a change in control); (iv) the outcome of present and future
tax audits and litigations; (v) potential changes in applicable laws and regulations; and (vi) in part, the
outcome of the ongoing proceedings with the French tax authorities. See "Risks related to legal and
_regulatory matters—Risks related to disputes—We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration_
_proceedings"._

_French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the_
_interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our_
_indebtedness._

As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39, 1-1° of the French Tax Code, expenses incurred by a French
company are deductible _provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct_
corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case
law has developed the concept of "abnormal act of management", according to which the expenses
incurred by a French company in connection with transactions that are not aligned with its direct
corporate interest are not tax deductible.

Under Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code, interest paid by an entity to its direct shareholders who
are not related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code are tax deductible
only up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in Article 39-1-3 of the
French Tax Code (i.e., the annual average of the average effective floating rates on bank loans to
companies with an initial maturity exceeding two years). Under Article 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code,
interest incurred on loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French
Tax Code is deductible up to the amount of interest computed on the basis of the rate referred to in
Article 39-1-3 of the French Tax Code or, if higher, up to the amount of interest computed on the basis
of the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial credit institutions in
similar circumstances.

Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of
the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity's share capital or actually exercises
the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to
the control of a same third entity.

In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Article 39-1-3 and 212 I-(a) of the French Tax Code), nondeductible interest might be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq.
of the French Tax Code, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of
the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the
second paragraph of Article 219 I of the French Tax Code (i.e., 26.5% for fiscal years beginning as from
January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022) for payments benefiting
legal persons or (ii) the rate of 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the
meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the
same Article 238-0 A (subject in any case to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax
treaty).

Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the French Tax Code, the deductibility of net financial expenses incurred
by an entity in respect of a given fiscal year is limited to the higher of (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a
_pro rata temporis basis for fiscal years which do not last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of its adjusted_
EBITDA in the same fiscal year (corresponding to its taxable income before offset of carryforward tax
losses and without taking into consideration net financial expenses and, to some extent, depreciation,
provisions and capital gains/losses) generated by such entity (the "30% Limitation"). Such limitation
applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings,
subject to certain limited exceptions.

Furthermore, for entities being part of a group that files eligible consolidated financial statements, a
safeguard clause has been implemented in order to partially exempt companies that are able to
demonstrate that the ratio of their own funds over their total assets is equal to or higher than the same
ratio computed at the level of the accounting consolidated group to which they belong. In this specific
case, net financial expenses exceeding the 30% Limitation are deductible up to 75% of their amount.

French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. Where the amount
of the related party debt of a company exceeds a ratio equal to 1.5 times the company's own funds, the
deduction of net financial expenses borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up
to the higher of (i) 30% of its adjusted EBITDA and (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the
average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly)
within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code increased by 1.5 times the company's own
funds (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average
amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net
financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its adjusted
EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from
or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the

70


-----

French Tax Code exceeding 1.5 times the company's own funds (assessed either at the beginning or
at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made
available to the company during said fiscal year. However, the interest deductibility limitation provided
for by these amended thin-capitalization rules does not apply if the borrowing company demonstrates
that the overall indebtedness ratio of the group as determined under accounting consolidation rules
(i.e., the ratio existing between the total amount of the consolidated group's debts (with the exception
of those owed to companies belonging to the consolidated group) and the amount of the consolidated
group's own funds) to which it belongs is higher than or equal to its own indebtedness ratio (i.e., the
ratio existing between the total amount of its debts and the amount of its own funds).

Financial expenses that are disallowed pursuant to the 30% Limitation can be carried forward
indefinitely and deducted in the future under the same conditions. On the other hand, the portion of
financial expenses which tax deduction is disallowed as a result of the application of the €1 million
threshold or 10% limitation is only eligible for carryforward for one-third of its amount. The unused
interest deduction capacity of a current fiscal year may also be used over the five following fiscal years,
but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years, it being noted that this
measure is not available to thinly capitalized entities.

Specific rules apply to companies that belong to French tax consolidated groups, mainly (i) the 30%
Limitation is computed on the basis of the consolidated adjusted EBITDA generated by such companies
and (ii) the 1.5 debt-to-own funds ratio is analyzed (x) on a consolidated basis pursuant to French
accounting rules applying for purposes of establishing consolidated financial statements and (y) in
respect of loans granted by related parties within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code
which do not belong to the same tax consolidated group.

Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated
May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not
deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the French Tax Code under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii)
Article 212 bis, VII of the French Tax Code under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized
as a "deemed distribution" pursuant to Articles 119 et seq. of the French Tax Code and, therefore, is
not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code.

Finally, the French Finance Law for 2020 includes specific provisions which implement into French tax
legislation the provisions of the ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries, which are
applicable as from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions which would be applicable as
from January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the
French Tax Code (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed.

Articles 205 B _et seq. of the French Tax Code implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest_
deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a
corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a
"deduction without inclusion") or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses
in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a "double deduction"). Such
limitations only apply to payments taking place between "associated enterprises", except for the socalled "structured arrangements" (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement
designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a
deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French
paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable
income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results
in a double deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the
level of the paying entity.

In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid
entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in
which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its "associated
enterprises" holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights,
capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a
hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the
case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions
provided for by Article 8 of the French Tax Code, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State.

Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group and in the absence of any administrative
doctrine on such new rules as of this date, the risk that the French tax authorities might try to challenge

71


-----

the deductibility of part of the interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings on such grounds
cannot be excluded.

The abovementioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness
incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect
our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service
our indebtedness.

Please also refer to "—Risks related to legal and regulatory matters—Risks related to disputes—We
_are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings" in relation to the ongoing challenge by the_
French tax authorities of the deductibility of the interest on the Shareholder Bonds.

_Our business may be adversely affected by an increase in the applicable VAT rates in the countries_
_where we operate._

Our products are subject to VAT in each of the countries where we operate with different applicable
rates set by each such country. As of December 31, 2018, standard VAT rate was 20% in France, 21%
in Belgium and 21% in Spain. From 2010 to 2012, European governments increased VAT rates in order
to bolster public finances, and there can be no assurance that VAT rates will not be further increased
in the future. Our published retail prices are inclusive of VAT.

In a decision dated January 17, 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Council
Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value-added tax did not
authorize Spain to apply a reduced rate of VAT to medical equipment, aid and devices of general use
that were not normally intended to alleviate or treat personal disabilities. This decision prompted
discussions in Spain regarding a potential increase in the VAT rate applicable to the sale of optical
products to the 21% standard VAT rate. In order to adapt the legislation to what is established in the
Court of Justice ruling, the Spanish legislator amended the list of goods subject to the reduced rate of
10% as from January 2015 and the entitlement to that reduced rate has been limited to, among other
products, a narrower range of pharmaceutical products that can be used by the consumer, and medical
equipment and devices (which include, among others, prescription glasses and contact lenses). Frames
of prescription glasses and products related to the maintenance of contact lenses were later included
within the list of products subject to the 10% reduced VAT rate, effective as from June 29, 2017.
Accordingly, in Spain, a reduced VAT rate of 10% currently applies to prescription glasses, prescription
eyeglass frames, contact lenses and the products necessary for the use, care and maintenance thereof.
This reduced rate does not apply to other accessories, spares and replacement parts of such goods. In
addition, the Spanish General Directorate of Taxes has also ruled that this 10% reduced rate is not
applicable to cases for lenses or glasses.

Other jurisdictions of the European Union where we have operations apply reduced VAT rates to the
sale of optical products and may be required to increase VAT rates to comply with European Union
regulations.

If VAT rates were to increase in the future or if the application of the reduced VAT rates were to be
abandoned by the relevant jurisdictions, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted if we do
not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT. However, if we pass the increase
in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may
decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Furthermore, we face VAT risks arising out of our operating activities in the normal course
of business and typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations.

**_Risks related to our indebtedness_**

_Our significant leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business,_
_results of operations, financial condition and prospects and may make it difficult to operate our business._

After the issuance of the Notes, we will be highly leveraged. As of January 31, 2021, as adjusted to give
effect to the Transactions and the application of the proceeds therefrom, we would have had total thirdparty gross debt excluding accrued interest of €479.0 million, of which €485.0 million would have been
represented by the Notes and €67.7 million would be have been represented by IFRS 16 leases. In
addition, as of the Issue Date, the Issuer will have €30.0 million available for drawing under the New
Revolving Credit Facility. The Issuer and its subsidiaries may, from time to time, guarantee debts of its
franchisees. At January 31, 2021, we had provided guarantees in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic to certain of our franchisees for an amount of €15.0 million. See "Capitalization". We also

72


-----

have significant commitments under our Guarantee Facilities (as defined under "Description of Certain
_Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements") in the amount of €15.6 million as of January 31, 2021,_
accounts receivable assignments, trade payables and the Shareholder Bonds held by shareholders.
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Off-_
_balance sheet commitments"._

The terms of the Indentures will permit the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, to incur
substantial additional indebtedness. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for
our business and operations, including, but not limited to:

  - limiting our and our subsidiaries' ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital
requirements, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements;

  - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other
debt and liabilities;

  - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on
our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working
capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

  - increasing our vulnerability, and reducing our flexibility to respond, to a downturn in our business
or general economic or industry conditions;

  - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or
greater financial resources than we have;

  - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and
industry;

  - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

  - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;
and

  - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries' ability to borrow additional funds or raise
equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our
indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future
operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from
operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors
and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures.

In addition, we may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including indebtedness in connection
with any future acquisition. The terms of the Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement will permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt
is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. Moreover, certain of the
debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral
that does not secure the Notes. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see "Management's
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital_
_resources"._

_We may incur substantially more debt in the future, including debt that is structurally senior to the Notes,_
_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to_
_operate our businesses._

Despite our significant leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. If any of the
Issuer's subsidiaries incurs additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share
ahead of holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation,
reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such subsidiaries. In addition, any debt ranking pari
_passu with the Notes may be secured by certain assets of the Issuer and holders of that debt will not_
be required to share with holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any
enforcement of the security interests in such assets. Borrowings under other debt agreements or
instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may as a

73


-----

result be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these debts in such
circumstances. Incremental debt at the level of the Issuer's subsidiaries that has cash-pay interest will
reduce the ability of the operating subsidiaries of the Issuer to upstream cash that could be used by the
Issuer to make interest payments on the Notes from time to time and to pay principal at maturity of the
Notes.

Although the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures will contain restrictions on
the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant
qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could
be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, the Indentures will not
prevent us from incurring obligations or entering into other arrangements that do not constitute
indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization financings. For a discussion
of our cash flows and liquidity, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital resources"._

In addition, the terms of the Indentures will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness,
including in respect of certain other secured debt that shares in the Collateral on a first-priority, including
super-senior, basis or second-priority basis. Furthermore, the Indentures will allow our non-Guarantor
subsidiaries to incur additional debt that would be structurally senior to the Notes and will not prevent
us from incurring liabilities that do not constitute "Indebtedness" as defined thereunder. The incurrence
of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering
Memorandum.

_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors_
_outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our_
_indebtedness, which may not be successful._

Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt
obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient
to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. Our ability to
generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative
and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate
sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned
capital expenditure. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient
to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

  - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures;

  - sell assets;

  - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

  - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

_We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely_
_basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all._

Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time.
Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us
to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms
of existing or future debt instruments and the Indentures may restrict us from adopting some of these
alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain
alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able
to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms
or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event,
borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration
provisions, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indentures, may become payable on
demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes.

In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a
timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur
additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flow generated from our operating results and
resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material
assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness,
including under the Indentures, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from

74


-----

any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or to obtain the funds
that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize
from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due.

_We are subject to covenants which limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under_
_our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._

The Indentures and the New Revolving Credit Facility will contain covenants that impose significant
restrictions on the way the Issuer and the Group can operate, including restrictions on our ability to:

  - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

  - layer certain types of indebtedness;

  - create or incur certain liens;

  - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

  - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity;

  - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

  - engage in certain transactions with affiliates;

  - create unrestricted subsidiaries;

  - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or
advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary;

  - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies;

  - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis;

  - change the holding company status of the Issuer;

  - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes;

  - guarantee certain indebtedness of the Issuer and its subsidiaries;

  - take certain actions at the Issuer level; and

  - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries.

All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See "Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants" and "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—_
_Certain covenants". These covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations and capital_
needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest.
Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our
control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these
covenants or restrictions, in addition to being in default under the Indentures and the Notes, we could
be in default under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indentures, and the
relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other
fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. This
would also result in an event of default under the Indentures. If the debt under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we
enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other
debt.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires our subsidiaries to maintain a minimum
amount of EBITDA. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our operating
results, as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in prices charged by our suppliers
and unfavorable economic conditions, and there can be no assurances that this test will be met. In
addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes certain affirmative covenants, as well
as negative covenants similar to those under the Indentures. A breach of any of those covenants or
restrictions could result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. If our
creditors, including the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, accelerate the
payment of amounts due under our various debt obligations, there can be no assurances that our assets
and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other

75


-----

liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to
repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors
could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. See
_"Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Revolving Credit Facility"._

**Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral**

_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer's non-guarantor subsidiaries._

As of the Issue Date, none of the Issuer's subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes or
Senior Subordinated Notes other than the Guarantors which will guarantee the Senior Secured Notes
on a senior basis and the Senior Subordinated Notes on a subordinated basis. The amount enforceable
under the Guarantees is limited to the outstanding amount under the Notes Proceeds Loans. Aside
from the Issuer, only 3AB Optique Développement, L'Opticien Afflelou and Alain Afflelou Franchiseur
will be party to Notes Proceeds Loans. The 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan is limited to
€347.2 million, the Alain Afflelou Franchiseur Proceeds Loan is limited to €30.0 million and the
L'Opticien Afflelou Proceeds Loan is limited to €20.0 million. Moreover, there are no restrictions on the
repayment or cancellation of the Alain Afflelou Franchiseur Proceeds Loan and the L'Opticien Afflelou
Proceeds Loan and only limited restrictions on the repayment or cancellation of the 3AB Optique
Développement Proceeds Loan. Any such repayment or cancellation would reduce the relevant
Guarantor's obligations under its Guarantees. Alain Afflelou International, 3ABOE and LSFA will not be
party to any Notes Proceeds Loan. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees will be subject to
the limitations described in "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests". By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's_
obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Notes, or a Guarantor (such as Alain Afflelou International, 3ABOE and LSFA) may have effectively no
obligation under its Guarantee. Other indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor may not be similarly
limited. In particular, although the Guarantees are for the benefit of the holders of both the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes, the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the guaranteed amounts will be applied
to satisfy amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes prior to the Senior Subordinated Notes.
See "Pursuant to the subordination provisions in the New Intercreditor Agreement, there is doubt as to
_the ability of holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to recover in relation to an enforcement action_
_premised on the Senior Subordinated Guarantees". In addition, none of the non-guarantor subsidiaries_
will have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose.
Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including
lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of
such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer as a direct or
indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries.

Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated,
reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction:

   - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed
against the assets of such subsidiary; and

   - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be
entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary
before the Issuer, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any
distributions from such subsidiary.

The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade
creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and our guarantor
subsidiaries, except to the extent of the enforceable amounts of such guarantees. As of January 31,
2021, the Issuer's subsidiaries had total third-party debt (excluding the lease debt mainly at Alain
Afflelou Franchiseur and L'Opticien Afflelou) of €31.0 million (primarily government-backed loans raised
by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur for a total of €30 million), of which €1 million will remain outstanding
following the Transactions and accordingly will rank structurally senior to the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Subordinated Notes. Furthermore, certain of our indebtedness is guaranteed by certain of
our subsidiaries that do not also guarantee the Notes, primarily relating to guarantees given to banks
on behalf of franchisees.

In addition, direct shareholders of indirect non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer and their creditors
will also be entitled to payments from the assets of such subsidiaries before any distributions will be
made to the Issuer as an indirect shareholder.

_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes_
_upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event as required by_
_the Indentures, and the change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily_
_afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a "change of control triggering event", the Issuer will
be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can
be no assurances that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have
sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the
restrictions in our Existing Notes Indentures, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the New
Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such
required repurchases. A change of control triggering event may result in an acceleration of our New
Revolving Credit Facility indebtedness or an event of default under our Indentures. The repurchase of
the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change
of control triggering event itself does not. Under certain circumstances, a change of control triggering
event under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement would, if so requested by a lender, result in
the cancellation of such lender's commitments and require the repayment of amounts outstanding under
such lender's commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and a change of control
triggering event may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, other indebtedness. In
addition, we may be required to repay a proportionate amount of debt under our New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. The ability of the Issuer
to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the
occurrence of a change of control triggering event, may be limited by our then existing financial
resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If
an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when we are prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of
the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained,
the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would
require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change
of control triggering event. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such financing.

Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indentures,
which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain
other indebtedness. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control" and
"Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Change of Control". The change of control provision
contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important
corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar
transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve
a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "Change of
Control Triggering Event" (as defined in the Indentures). In addition, certain events that constitute a
change of control triggering event under any one of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture may not constitute a
change of control under the other agreements.

In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control
triggering event will be deemed not to be a change of control triggering event, provided that a ratings
downgrade has not occurred. In addition, even if a ratings downgrade has occurred, a change of control
triggering event will not be deemed to have occurred if upon consummation thereto, a certain
consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

The definition of "Change of Control" in the Indentures will include a disposition of all or substantially all
of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although
there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "all or substantially all", there is no precise,
established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of "all
or substantially all" of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a

77


-----

result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is
required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.

_Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security_
_interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security_
_interests in the Collateral._

The Guarantors will guarantee and the Issuer and the Guarantors will provide security interests in
respect of, the payment of the Senior Secured Notes on a first-ranking basis and of the Senior
Subordinated Notes on a second-ranking basis. The Issuer and the French Guarantors are incorporated
under the laws of France and the Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.
Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the Guarantors or the enforcement of a
security interest in the Collateral will be subject to certain defenses available to the Guarantors or the
Issuer, as applicable, in the relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be. Although laws differ in these
jurisdictions, these laws and defenses available to the Guarantors or the Issuer may include those that
relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization,
capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. Furthermore, the amounts recoverable under such Guarantees or Collateral, as applicable,
will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor
under French law, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant
Guarantor's corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to
the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance,
financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws
and/or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil
or criminal liability. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have
no liability or decreased liability under their respective Guarantees or the security interest in the
Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other obligations
and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such
jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or security interest
in the Collateral against any of the Issuer and the Guarantors .

The credit support under the Guarantees provided by the Guarantors organized under the laws of
France is subject to:

   - French rules relating to financial assistance pursuant to which a company is prohibited
from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for
the purpose of its acquisition or of the subscription of its shares, and the guarantee may
not include any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial
assistance, including, for example, within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French
Code de Commerce or an infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or
L. 244-1 of the French Code de Commerce (or any other laws or regulations having the
same effect, as interpreted by French courts); and

   - French rules relating to corporate benefit: the grant of a guarantee by a French company
for the obligations of another group company must be for the corporate benefit of the
granting company.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if
payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the
payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not receive some
real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a
whole. The existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-bycase basis. French case law has recognized that certain intragroup transactions (including upstream
guarantees) can be in the corporate interest of the relevant company, particularly, where the following
five criteria are fulfilled:

   - the existence of a genuine group of companies to which the guarantor and the person
whose obligations are being guaranteed belong operating under a common strategy aimed
at a common objective and the guarantee or security documents, and the transaction to
which they relate, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of
the group as a whole and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with
such group benefit;

78


-----

   - the risk assumed by a French guarantor is proportionate to the benefit;

   - the transaction maintains a balance between the financial commitments of the relevant
affiliates;

   - the French guarantor receives an actual and adequate benefit, consideration or advantage
from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee or security interest which
is commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee or security interest;
and

   - the obligations of the French guarantor under the guarantee do not exceed its financial
capability.

The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed
are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides
no clear guidance.

The Guarantees provide the holders of the relevant Notes with a direct claim against the Guarantors.
However, the Indentures will provide that each Guarantee and the amounts recoverable will be limited
to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering its
relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, and enforcement of each
Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses.

In addition, under French law, the Guarantees will be limited for each Guarantor to the aggregate
amount of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such Guarantor and outstanding from
time to time. Any payment that will be made by such Guarantor under such proceeds loans would
reduce the maximum amount of its Guarantee. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests"._

The granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company is subject to specific limitations
and requirements arising from considerations related to its corporate object and corporate benefit. The
granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company must come within its corporate
object ("objet social"). In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of
guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company must be in furtherance of its corporate benefit
("interêt social"). In particular, according to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg law dated 10 August
1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the "Luxembourg Companies Law"), it is a criminal
offence for managers or directors of a company to use the assets or the credit of a company for a
purpose which they know to be against the interest of the company in their personal interest, or in the
interest of companies in which they are directly or indirectly interested. The granting of a guarantee or
of a security interest in violation of article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law would constitute
a criminal offence committed by the managers/directors of the company but there is also a risk that the
guarantee/the security interest could be considered to be null and void. There is no relevant
Luxembourg case law on the application of this provision to intra-group financing transactions. With
respect to guarantee, regard may however be given to the situation in France as the Luxembourg legal
provision on abuse of corporate assets is identical to the French provisions and Luxembourg courts
tend to take into consideration French case law in respect of legal provisions which are similar in both
jurisdictions. French case law has developed certain criteria under which a company may, in the
absence of a direct own benefit, grant a guarantee for the obligations of another group company without
violating French law provisions equivalent to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law.

In respect of guarantees, the following criteria, which have been used by the French Supreme Court
(Cour de Cassation), may be used as a general guideline:

  - the transaction in the context of which the guarantee is granted is entered into with a view to
furthering economic, social or financial interests within the framework of a common policy
defined for the group as a whole;

  - the financial commitments (a) are entered into for consideration (not necessarily monetary)
and (b) do not disturb the balance between the respective commitments of the group
companies; and

  - the financial commitments do not exceed the financial capabilities of the company which
bears the burden of such commitments.

79


-----

Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is
broadly interpreted and includes any transactions from which the Luxembourg company derives a direct
or indirect economic or commercial benefit. The question as to whether there is sufficient corporate
benefit for a company to grant a guarantee is very fact-based and is to be assessed by the
managers/directors of the relevant company.

The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no
particular concerns, whereas the provision of guarantees in favor of companies who have the same
direct or indirect shareholders as the Luxembourg company (cross-stream assistance) and companies
who are the direct or indirect shareholder of the Luxembourg company, such as the Guarantees of the
Luxembourg Guarantor, (upstream assistance) are less likely to directly benefit the guarantor. With
respect to security interests, no issue should arise, in principle, in relation to cross-stream and upstream
security interests, as such security interests are limited by nature to the assets subject to the relevant
security interest (and can therefore not exceed the financial capabilities of the company required to
grant such a security interest).

As a result, the Guarantees granted by the Luxembourg Guarantor may be subject to certain limitations,
which will take the form of a guarantee limitation language, which will be inserted in the New Intercreditor
Agreement and which covers, subject to certain exceptions, the aggregate obligations and exposure of
the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under all the Finance Documents.

For the sake of completeness, any security interests/guarantees granted by entities organized in the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which constitute a breach of the provisions on financial assistance as
defined by article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar provisions (to the
extent applicable, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, to an entity organized under the laws of
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), might not be enforceable, if the specific requirements set out in the
Luxembourg Companies Law are not met. We do however take the view that the rules on financial
assistance should not apply to the Guarantees by the Luxembourg Guarantor considering that such
Guarantees are not granted with a view of the acquisition of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s shares.

_The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared unenforceable_
_against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._

French and Luxembourg laws contain similar specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance
both in and outside bankruptcy. These provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their
means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which the person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees
to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party's obligations, enters into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be
challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of
the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, and may be
declared unenforceable against third parties under both French and Luxembourg law if: (i) the person
performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the
person's bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the
act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction
knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in
their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration in which case such
knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent
conveyance.

In addition, in the case of the bankruptcy of the Luxembourg Guarantor, the liquidator, receiver,
administrative receiver or administrator may nullify the debtor's performance of any due and payable
obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party's
obligations) if (i) the payee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of
performance or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor
and the payee in order to give preference to the latter over the debtor's other creditors. If a court finds
that the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests the share pledges or bank accounts
pledges, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any
defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in
the share pledges or bank accounts pledges could be declared unenforceable or nullified.

As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not benefit from the Guarantees or
the security interests in the share pledges, intragroup receivables or bank account pledges and the
value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the security interests in

80


-----

the share pledges, intragroup receivables or bank account pledges or the Guarantees could also be
subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In
addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred
by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. See
"Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests—France" and "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and_
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—_
_Luxembourg"._

_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in the_
_Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company organized and established under the laws of France,
and will be guaranteed by the French Guarantors, which are organized under the laws of France and
the Luxembourg Guarantor, which is organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The
Notes will be secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Guarantors and the Issuer.
In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these
jurisdictions. The rights of holders of the Notes under the Guarantees or under security interests in the
Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to enforce
such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings.

Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors. In
addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of France and Luxembourg may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors' rights, the priority of
creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The
application of these various laws in these jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's
law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any recovery under the Notes and the
Guarantees or under security interests in the Collateral.

Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the
Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or
whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority
(according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security
Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including
unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on
_the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests"._

Under Luxembourg and French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the
Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by specific or general
defenses available to debtors under Luxembourg or French law, as the case may be, in respect of the
validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest.

_The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be_
_favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights_
_under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._

The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized
and existing under the laws of France or, in the case of the Luxembourg Guarantor, Luxembourg. In
the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in France or
Luxembourg. Proceedings could also be initiated in France or Luxembourg to enforce your rights
against Collateral located in those jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be
complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding
the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your
rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition,
while the Luxembourg Guarantor conducts the majority of its business in Luxembourg, to the extent that
its center of main interests is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French insolvency
proceedings, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings) and
court-controlled insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde), accelerated financial safeguard proceedings
(sauvegarde financière accélérée), or reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or
_liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business_
and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the
Notes to enforce their rights. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—France"._

81


-----

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer's and the Guarantors'
jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States,
including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to
obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any
conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's law should apply,
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral
in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive.

Finally, pursuant to the European Parliament and the Council Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings
in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company
has its "center of main interests". Therefore, to the extent that the "center of main interests" of the Issuer
is deemed to be in France, French courts may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the
Issuer.

_Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._

The Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States,
and their business is conducted entirely outside the United States. All of the directors and executive
officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are nonresidents of the United States. Although the Issuer and
the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action
under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process in the United States on the
directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because all of the assets
the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and
executive officers are located outside the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them
judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be
subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with
France or Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in France or Luxembourg of
civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France or
Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in France or Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a U.S.
court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be
subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a French or Luxembourg court would have the
requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in France or
Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information, see "Service of
_Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities"._

_Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and_
_future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indentures and the New_
_Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be_
_repaid with recoveries from the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the_
_Notes._

The New Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of recoveries from
guarantee claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and enforcement
proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the
acceleration of the Notes or the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is required to pay
turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions to discharge
obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and future
indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to discharge the Notes. As such, in the event of a
foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims
under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness are
greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral
will, after all obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and such hedging obligations and, if
applicable future Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility under the
application of proceeds provisions in New Intercreditor Agreement have been discharged, be applied
_pro rata in repayment of the Senior Secured Notes and, if applicable, future indebtedness that ranks_
_pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes under the application of proceeds provisions of the New_
Intercreditor Agreement. Any proceeds remaining thereafter will be applied pro rata in repayment of the
Senior Subordinated Notes and, if applicable, future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the Senior
Subordinated Notes under the application of proceeds provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement.

82


-----

Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the
claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors
to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

_The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security_
_interests in accordance with the law applicable in France._

The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create
hardening periods for such security interests in France. The applicable hardening period for these new
security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or
recreated. In addition, the Indentures will permit the security interests in the Collateral to be released
and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening
periods. Moreover, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness may restart
or reopen hardening periods in France. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such
new security is amended, granted or perfected. In each case, if the security interest granted, perfected
or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such
jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See "Certain Insolvency
_Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests"._

_You may be required to pay a "soulte" in the event you decide to enforce the securities account by_
_judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such_
_Collateral in a public auction._

Security interests governed by French law may only secure payment obligations, may only be enforced
following a payment default and may only secure up to the secured amount that is due and remaining
unpaid. Under French law, pledges over assets may generally be enforced at the option of the secured
creditors either (i) pursuant to a judicial process (x) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public
auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (y) by way of the judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte
_commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors_
become the legal owner of the pledged assets. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of
foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or private foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be
deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the
judge in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a
private attribution (pacte commissoire). In a proceeding regarding an attribution judiciaire or a pacte
_commissoire, an expert is appointed to value the collateral (in this case, the securities) and if the value_
of the collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities and the
amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received
by the secured creditor from a subsequent sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities/assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount
owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities/assets,
and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured.

Should a holder of the Notes decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the
securities/assets, an enforcement of the pledged securities/assets could be undertaken through a public
auction in accordance with applicable law. Since such public auction procedures are not designed for
a sale of a business as a going concern, however, it is possible that the sale price received in any such
auction might not reflect the value of our business as a going concern.

_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indentures and/or the New Intercreditor Agreement
and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking security interests in the Collateral
securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The
existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could
adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or
foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety
of factors, including, among others, prior statutory or other liens, in particular in cases where lien
searches are not available (for instance, for pledges over bank accounts or pledges over receivables).

83


-----

In France and Luxembourg, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered,
including pledges over securities accounts, bank accounts or receivables. As a result, there can be no
assurances as to the priority of the French and Luxembourg law-governed pledges over the Collateral
comprising assets of these types. The ranking of security interests can also be affected by the timely
satisfaction of perfection requirements or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated
with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For
example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent
regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. There can be no assurance that the
Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. There can be no assurances that the consents
of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly,
the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the
Collateral may significantly decrease.

_Holders of each series of Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral, which will also
secure the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain hedging obligations
and certain other indebtedness (the "Super Senior Liabilities") and the Senior Subordinated Notes will
be secured on a second-priority basis by the Collateral.

The Indentures also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the
terms thereof and the New Intercreditor Agreement. The New Intercreditor Agreement provides that the
Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the New Intercreditor Agreement, and
regulates the ability of the Trustees or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to
do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Senior Secured Notes, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking _pari passu with the_
Senior Secured Notes and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the "Senior
**Secured Credit Participations") which aggregate more than 50.1% of the total Senior Secured Credit**
Participations at that time (the "Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders") (in each case acting through their
respective creditor representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super
Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement
instructions first being issued or if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three
months of enforcement instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the
Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided
by creditors holding more than 66.66% of the indebtedness and commitments under the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement and the certain priority hedging obligations (the "Majority Super Senior
Creditors") will prevail.

Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on
behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may at any
time provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior
Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of
any enforcement action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security
Agent's ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such
circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the
subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and
instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are
consistent with certain security enforcement principles.

If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency
event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of
the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall
act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance
with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the
Security Agent has received proposed enforcement instructions from the creditor representative for the
Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders and has commenced enforcement action pursuant to such
instructions, the Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor
representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as the representative for the
Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such
instructions shall override and supersede any such prior instructions given by the creditor representative

for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders. Furthermore, the rights to enforce remedies with respect to
the Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees
are limited. See "—Risks related to the Senior Secured Notes—The rights to enforce remedies with
_respect to the Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes_
_Guarantees are limited as long as any senior secured debt is outstanding"._

To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with either the
Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes, the voting interest of holders of such Notes in
an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur.

The lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the creditors in respect of certain
priority hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the
Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their
remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of
the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of
the Issuer's subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the New Intercreditor
Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing
the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New
_Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of Liens"_
and "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Security—Release of Liens".

Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes
will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or
to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security
Agent as provided in the New Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to
have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited
remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See "Description
_of Certain Other Indebtedness—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

_The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of_
_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._

The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in
possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any
income from the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no
enforcement event has occurred, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any
release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the
Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making
ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.

_The Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated in Luxembourg, and Luxembourg law differs from U.S. law_
_and may afford less protection to holders of the Notes._

Holders of the Notes may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would security holders of
a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As a Luxembourg company, the
Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under and subject to the Luxembourg Companies Law and other
provisions of Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Companies Law differs in some material respects from
laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and security holders, including the provisions relating to
interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, security holder lawsuits and
indemnification of directors.

Under Luxembourg law, the duties of directors and managers of a company are generally owed to the
company only. Security holders of Luxembourg companies generally do not have rights to take action
against directors or managers of the company, except in limited circumstances. Directors or managers
of a Luxembourg company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act in good
faith and in the interests of the company as a whole and must exercise due care, skill and diligence.
Directors or managers have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the
company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal
interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or
manager of a Luxembourg company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company, he or
she may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. A director or manager
may be jointly and severally liable with other directors implicated in the same breach of duty.

_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the_
_Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._

For a description of the security over the Collateral, see "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Security" and "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Security". In the event of an enforcement_
of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges
may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer's obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the
value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets
underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among others, whether or not the
business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the
economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required
to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the New Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain
Collateral, the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and certain
future indebtedness will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes, will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes and the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will only be
entitled to receive any payment from such distribution with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes
after the Senior Secured Notes have been repaid in full.

The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes
may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other
assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise,
there can be no assurances that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be
substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes, and it is
possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness
secured by such Collateral. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares may not recover
anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline
over time.

The Indentures will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of
the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties
have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indentures or the
Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the
Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the
Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indentures, holders of such additional notes
would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting
your ability to benefit from the liens on the Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Indentures,
to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral
including, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage
Ratio (as defined and described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain covenants—
_Limitation on Indebtedness"), the definition of Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined under_
"Description of the Senior Secured Notes") for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior
Secured Leverage Ratio contains certain important exceptions and carve-outs.

_The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._

The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and
the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will not be granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indentures and the New
Intercreditor Agreement will provide that only the Security Agent as security agent, trustee and Parallel
Debt (as defined below) creditor has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence,
holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement
action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustees under the Indentures,
who will (subject to the provisions of the Indentures) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the
Collateral.

Under both French and Luxembourg law, certain "accessory" security interests such as rights of pledge
require that the pledgee and the creditor are the same person. Such security interests cannot be held
on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim. The beneficial holders of interests in the
Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial
holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the New Intercreditor Agreement will provide for
the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the "Parallel Debt") mirroring

86


-----

the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes
under or in connection with the Indentures (the "Principal Obligations"). The Parallel Debt will at all times
be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in
respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment
in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the
Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an
obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French or Luxembourg law will directly secure the
Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness
secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in
respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances
direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French
courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel
Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not
receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the
Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency
or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the creditor of the Parallel Debt.

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) relating to a bond
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of
certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting
from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal
holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy
(ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not
exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although
this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French
courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a
structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal
issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally
uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. Case law on this matter is scarce and based
on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the
enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is
no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French
law.

The Parallel Debt construction has not been tested under Luxembourg law, and there is no certainty
that it will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of security interests posed by Luxembourg
law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt construction
are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this
basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as
the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

The concept of "trust" has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com.
September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by
the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings
opened in France. However, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law
applicable to trusts and on their recognition (the "Trust Convention"), so that the concept of "trust" has
not been generally recognized under French law. Luxembourg has ratified the Trust Convention so that
any trust to which the Trust Convention applies will be recognized under Luxembourg law subject to the
Trust Convention. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—France" and "Certain Insolvency Law_
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests—Luxembourg"._

_The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have_
_been granted as security for the Notes or the Guarantees._

If there is an event of default in respect of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to
the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes or the Guarantees.
In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security
over assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in
certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement,
subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indentures may require, subject to
local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the Notes. The agreed
security principles set forth in the Indentures contain a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders
to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may
result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or
security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed
security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors.

To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing those
Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other
existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes,
provided that the Senior Subordinated Notes will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to
any senior indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. As a result, if the value
of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the
Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are
paid.

_Investors' rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in_
_the Collateral._

Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and
its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The security interests in
the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes if the Security Agent is not able to or does
not take the actions it is directed to take by the relevant group of creditors, which are necessary to
perfect any such security interests. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security
interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in
favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim
a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property
and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such
property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that we will inform the
Security Agent of the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the
necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral.
The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that
constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss
of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against
third parties.

Additionally, the Indentures and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the Notes will
not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the security
interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the
Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent's rights will be
equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy,
reorganization or similar proceeding.

_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral_
_securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees_
_will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustees._

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released
automatically as described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release of
_Liens" and under "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Security—Release of Liens",_
including:

with the Indentures;

  - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of an

outstanding or certain other classes of debt ranking junior to the Senior Subordinated Notes is
outstanding, in an enforcement scenario, exercise its rights to release the security interests in the
Collateral unless the relevant sale or disposal is made:

  - for consideration, all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash; or

  - pursuant to an auction or other competitive sale process, under the consultation of an
internationally recognized investment bank or accountancy firm who shall (save in certain
circumstances) opine on the consideration received by giving a fairness opinion.

_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._

The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by
reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchangerelated risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative
to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments
because of economic, political and other factors which affect currency exchange rates over which we
have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor
measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes
below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her
investments. Investments in the Notes, including by US holders (as defined in "Certain tax
_considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations ") who use the U.S. dollar as their_
functional currency may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains
or losses, if any. Investors in the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of the Notes.

_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and may_
_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal
by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for
any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit
rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely
affect the value and trading of the Notes.

_Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._

Because the Notes have not or will not have been, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S.
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the
United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with
Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the
ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers

-----

and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws.
For further information, see "Transfer restrictions".

_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures_
_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._

The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and
Clearstream.

Interests in the Global Notes (as defined under "Book-entry; Delivery and Form") will trade in book-entry
form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under
"Book-entry; Delivery and Form"), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited
circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The
common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of
the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on
or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will
make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to
participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and
credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for
Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a bookentry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not
participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through
which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the
Indentures.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right
to act upon the Issuer's solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the
extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The
procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor
to vote on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an "Event of Default" under an Indenture, unless and until Definitive
Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests,
they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented
through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under
the Notes and the Indentures. See "Book-entry; Delivery and Form".

_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will_
_be limited._

The Notes are new issues of securities for which there are currently no established trading markets.
There can be no assurances as to:

     - the number of holders of the Notes;

      - the market for similar securities;

      - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

      - your ability to sell the Notes; or

      - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing
interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities.
Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. There can be no assurances
that the market, if any, for each series of the Notes will be free from similar disruptions and any such
disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and
financial performance. Therefore, there can be no assurances that you will be able to sell the Notes at
a particular time or the price that you receive when you sell the Notes will be favorable. The Initial
Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in each series of the Notes after completing
this Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities

91


-----

at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed
by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an
active trading market for either series of the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not
be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all.

_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed Official List of Euronext Dublin._

Although the Issuer will, in the Indentures, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Notes listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof after the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding,
there can be no assurances that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain
the listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin and the admission to trading on the Global
Exchange Market or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may
cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin, provided that the
Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (prior to the delisting of the Notes, if applicable)
and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance
that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes
as a result of listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin or another recognized listing exchange
for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indentures, failure to be approved for listing or the
delisting of the relevant Notes from the Official List of the Euronext Dublin or another listing exchange
in accordance with the Indentures may have a material adverse effect on a holder's ability to resell
Notes in the secondary market.

_The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the "Commission's
**Proposal") for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France,**
Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the "Participating Member
States") and which, if enacted and implemented by France, should replace the French FTT. Following
the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the "ECOFIN") meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia
officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the
formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT. The Commission's Proposal has a very
broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market
transactions) in certain circumstances.

At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the
basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating
Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the
French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed
companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is
still subject to change until a final approval.

The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the scope
of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional
EU Member States may decide to participate and Participating Member States may decide to withdraw.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
FTT.

_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for US federal income tax purposes._

The Notes may be issued with OID for US federal income tax purposes. In such event, holders subject
to US federal income tax will generally be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary
income) as it accrues (on a constant yield to maturity basis) for US federal income tax purposes in
advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such OID is attributable and regardless of the holder's
regular method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes. See "Certain Tax Considerations—
_Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount"._

**Risks related to the Senior Subordinated Notes**

_The Senior Subordinated Notes will be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any existing_
_and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured_
_Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any._

The Senior Subordinated Notes will be the general senior subordinated obligation of the Issuer, and
will:

92


-----

   - be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any existing or future senior
indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any;

   - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer
(other than senior indebtedness) that is not subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Subordinated Notes;

   - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the subsidiaries of
the Issuer (other than subsidiaries that are or that become Guarantors), including
obligations owed to trade creditors and bilateral facilities and, to the extent drawings are
borrowed by such non-Guarantor subsidiaries, obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility; and

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Subordinated Notes or that
secure the Senior Subordinated Notes on a lower priority basis, to the extent of the value
of such property and assets, including the Collateral securing on a first-priority basis the
Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations,
if any.

The New Intercreditor Agreement contains significant restrictions with respect to payments on the
Senior Subordinated Notes (including being subject to a blockage on payments upon the occurrence of
certain events of default with respect to senior indebtedness). Until the liabilities of the lenders under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, the holders of Senior Secured Notes and holders of other senior
indebtedness are fully discharged or the relevant event of default with respect to the senior
indebtedness has been remedied or waived, payments will not be permitted to be made in respect of
the Senior Subordinated Notes until the expiration of the applicable payment blockage period (unless
such parties otherwise consent thereto). In some circumstances, including in the case in which
payments were received on the Senior Subordinated Notes in breach of the New Intercreditor
Agreement, holders of Senior Subordinated Notes would be required to turn over such payments to the
creditor representatives of senior creditors, including the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and the Senior Secured Notes, for application in accordance with the waterfall provisions of the
New Intercreditor Agreement. See "—The rights to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral
_securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees are limited as_
_long as any senior secured debt is outstanding"._

Accordingly, upon any distribution to the creditors of the Issuer in liquidation, administration, bankruptcy,
moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding-up of the Issuer, the holders of Senior
Subordinated Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of senior indebtedness of the Issuer,
including the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties (if any)
and holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

_Pursuant to the subordination provisions in the New Intercreditor Agreement, there is doubt as to the_
_ability of holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to recover in relation to an enforcement action premised_
_on the Senior Subordinated Guarantees._

By virtue of the subordination provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the Senior
Subordinated Guarantees become subject to an enforcement action, it is likely that given the relative
size of the existing and any future senior indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Issuer's obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if
any, compared to the aggregate amount of Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding as of the Issue Date
and due to the limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees under French law, payments to holders
of the Senior Secured Notes or lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging
obligations, if any, would consume all amounts recoverable under the Senior Subordinated Guarantees,
as the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any,
must be discharged in full before claims under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture are repaid with
proceeds from enforcement. As a result of the foregoing, the obligations of the several Guarantors
under the Senior Subordinated Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with
respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, and residual proceeds, if any, from enforcement of the Senior
Subordinated Guarantee at any given time may be minimal. Investors should note the general
limitations and exceptions to enforceability to the Senior Subordinated Guarantees imposed by French
law discussed elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations

93


-----

_and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—_
_France"._

_The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and New Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions that_
_subordinate our obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes._

Our obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Guarantees will be
subordinated to the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under certain senior indebtedness,
including the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations,
if any. Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes should recognize that contractual provisions in the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and New Intercreditor Agreement will subordinate the Senior
Subordinated Notes (and related Senior Subordinated Guarantees) and rank them junior in right of
payment, to the extent and in the manner stated in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, to any
existing and future designated senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the
Issuer's and the Guarantors' obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit
Facility and certain hedging obligations, if any. As a result of the foregoing, it is likely that holders of
existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors would recover
disproportionally more than the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes in any insolvency or similar
proceeding. For additional information regarding the subordination provisions applicable to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture, see "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—New Intercreditor
_Agreement—Subordination"._

_The Senior Subordinated Notes will benefit from second-priority security over the Collateral and be_
_effectively subordinated to our existing and future senior indebtedness that is secured over assets other_
_than the Collateral._

The Senior Subordinated Notes will benefit from second-priority security interests over the Collateral,
as further described under "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Security". In contrast, the
Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority basis
over the Collateral, as further described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security".
along with obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if any, certain hedging
obligations and certain other future Indebtedness obligations.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to incur
debt that can be secured by the Collateral on a first-priority basis and by assets that do not constitute
Collateral, each of which will be effectively senior to the Senior Subordinated Notes. In the event of any
distribution or payment of our assets in any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
administration, reorganization, or other insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of such secured
debt will have a prior claim to those of our assets that constitute their collateral. In these circumstances,
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the Senior Subordinated
Notes. As a result, holders of Senior Subordinated Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of such
secured debt. As of January 31, 2021, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have
had (i) €445.0 million of indebtedness and commitments secured on the Collateral on a first-priority
basis, consisting of the Senior Secured Notes and commitments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and (ii) €75.0 million of indebtedness secured on the Collateral on a second-priority basis,
consisting of the Senior Subordinated Notes.

_The rights to enforce remedies with respect to the Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes_
_and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees are limited as long as any senior secured debt is_
_outstanding._

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority
basis by security interests over the Collateral along with obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and, if any, certain hedging obligations and certain other future Indebtedness
obligations. The Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees will be
secured on a second-priority basis by the Collateral. As such, the security interests in all of the Collateral
securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee will rank
behind the first-priority security interests in such Collateral in favor of the creditors under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations, if any, and
any indebtedness that is permitted to be incurred and secured by the Collateral and that is permitted to
rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility, as well
as in favor of institutions with whom we may enter into certain hedging arrangements ("senior debt").
The New Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common security agent will serve as the Security
Agent for the secured parties under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated

94


-----

Notes Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging arrangements and will (subject
to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to such Collateral only at the direction of the relevant
instructing group until amounts outstanding are paid in full and discharged. Until the expiration of a
standstill period on enforcement of such security on behalf of holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes,
secured parties under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and
institutions who are counterparties to certain of our hedging arrangements will have (subject to certain
limited exceptions) the exclusive right to make all decisions with respect to the enforcement of remedies
relating to such Collateral. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New Intercreditor
_Agreement"._

As a result, the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will not be able to force a sale of such
structural security, or otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the
relevant security documents, until the expiration of the applicable standstill period for so long as any
amounts under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging
arrangements remain outstanding. The creditors under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New
Revolving Credit Facility and the institutions who are counterparties to certain of our hedging
arrangements may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a
time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes to do so. This
may affect the ability of holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes to recover under the Collateral if the
proceeds from the Collateral, after having satisfied obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging arrangements are less than the
aggregate amount outstanding under the Senior Subordinated Notes.

In addition, if the creditors or the agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New Revolving
Credit Facility or certain hedging arrangements sell the shares of a group company through an
enforcement of their first-priority security interest, in accordance with the terms of the New Intercreditor
Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee and the liens over any other assets securing the
Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee may be released. See
"Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of Senior
_Subordinated Notes—Security—Release of Liens"._

We may also issue further indebtedness which will be entitled to rank pari passu with or senior to the
Senior Subordinated Notes in right and priority of payment and which will be entitled to share in the
Collateral with the Senior Subordinated Notes on a pari passu or senior-ranking basis. In the event that
any such debt is issued, the creditor voting rights of holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will be
diluted proportionately to the amount of debt incurred, as voting under the New Intercreditor Agreement
is across the class of creditors.

_The ability of holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to recover under the Collateral may be limited._

The obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee
will be secured by security interests granted on a second priority basis over the Collateral, as described
under "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Security". First-priority security interests in such
assets will be granted for the benefit of creditors under Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging arrangements. First-priority security interests over
the same collateral may also be granted to indebtedness incurred in the future. Holders of the Senior
Subordinated Notes may not be able to recover on the Collateral because the creditors under the Senior
Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain of our hedging arrangements will have a
prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Collateral and any distressed disposal
with respect to such Collateral, and the Senior Subordinated Notes will need to share any remaining
proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured creditor ranking pari passu with the Senior
Subordinated Notes. If the proceeds realized from the enforcement of such pledges or such sale or
sales exceed the amount owed under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and
certain of our hedging arrangements, any excess amount of such proceeds will be paid to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. If
there are no excess proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the aggregate
amount of the obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes, the holders of Senior Subordinated
Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such Collateral.

In addition, Collateral may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us.
Likewise, there can be no assurances that there will be a market for the Collateral or that, if such market
does exist, there will not be substantial delays in its liquidation. The shares pledges of the Collateral

95


-----

may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in
relation to any entity, the shares of which have been pledged as part of the Collateral. As a result, the
holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not recover anything of value in the case of an
enforcement sale of shares pledged. In addition, the value of the Collateral may fluctuate over time.

Pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and holders of
the Senior Subordinated Notes will (subject to certain limited exceptions) not be able to force a sale of
the Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes or otherwise independently pursue the remedies
of a secured creditor under the Security Documents relating to such for so long as any amounts under
the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain of our hedging arrangements or
any future secured indebtedness, if any, remain outstanding and, if the creditors under the Senior
Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our hedging arrangements enforce their
security, they will have priority over the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes with respect to the
proceeds from the Collateral. As such, holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not be able to
recover on the Collateral if the claims of the creditors under the Senior Secured Notes, the New
Revolving Credit Facility or certain of our hedging arrangements, if any, are greater than the proceeds
realized from any enforcement of the Collateral. In addition, if the creditors or the agent or the Security
Agent under the Senior Secured Notes or the New Revolving Credit Facility direct the sale of shares
pledged as part of the Collateral through an enforcement of their first priority security interest in
accordance with the New Intercreditor Agreement, the second priority security interest over such shares
securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee may (subject
to certain conditions) be automatically released. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New
_Intercreditor Agreement" and "Description of Senior Subordinated Notes—Security—Release of Liens"._

_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the New
Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code
pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or
reorganization plan which is put to the vote of the creditors' committees takes into consideration (prend
_en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior_
to the commencement of the safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received
no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain
provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement.

_The validity of second or lower ranking pledges may not be recognized by French courts._

The New Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or
lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower)
ranking pledge in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code
does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this
article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities account. In addition, a pledge
over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the
possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking
pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore
provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third
party as "tiers convenu" (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured
parties have consented to the creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking
secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as
custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This
structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second
or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower
ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely
affect the recovery under the Senior Subordinated Notes or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees (as
applicable) following an enforcement event.

96


-----

_Assumptions as to the enforceability of second ranking bank accounts pledges_

The pledges over the bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a
company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from
granting a second ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before
the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld
if tested.

In addition, although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account
from granting a second ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested
before the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be
upheld if tested.

_Enforcement actions with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes are subject to a standstill period._

Under the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement, no enforcement action with respect to the Senior
Subordinated Notes may be taken unless (subject to certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement
action has been taken with respect to debt ranking senior to the Senior Subordinated Notes (provided
the Trustee and holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will be limited to taking the same action);
(ii) an insolvency event has occurred with respect to the Issuer or Guarantor (to the extent such event
has not occurred solely as a result of any action taken by the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or
holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes); (iii) there is a default on the Senior Subordinated Notes
outstanding after a period of 179 days from the date the agent or Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee
with respect to senior debt received written notice of such default; (iv) a default has occurred resulting
from a failure to pay principal on the Senior Subordinated Notes at maturity or (v) each agent with
respect to outstanding senior debt and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee has given its consent to
the proposed action. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New Intercreditor Agreement—
_Senior Subordinated Notes Standstill Period"._

_A large part of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate, which could rise significantly,_
_increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow, or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of the_
_holders of the Notes._

We are, and following the Offering will continue to be, exposed to the risks of fluctuations in interest
rates. A significant portion of our current debt is subject to variable interest rates indexed to Euro
Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"). Following the Offering, a significant portion of our debt, including
under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility, will be subject to variable
interest rates indexed to EURIBOR. We may also enter into additional indebtedness bearing floating
rates of interest in the future, including by issuing additional Senior Subordinated Notes. EURIBOR,
LIBOR and/or any other floating interest rate index applicable to such indebtedness could rise
significantly in the future.

To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would
correspondingly increase to the extent of the drawings under, or issuances of, such debt bearing floating
rates of interest, thereby reducing our cash flow. We may enter into certain interest rate hedging
obligations designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required to do so. In addition, there can
be no assurance that hedging will be available on commercially reasonable terms or, if available, will
be successful in mitigating the risks related to increasing interest rates. See "Description of Certain
_Other Indebtedness"._

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and
law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting
investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of EURIBOR
or LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. As a result,
EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates are indices which are deemed to be "benchmarks" are the
subject of recent and ongoing national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for
reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July
2013) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the "Benchmarks Regulation") which was published in the
Official Journal of the EU on June 29, 2016, and applies since January 1, 2018. Some of these reforms
are already effective while others are still to be implemented. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to

97


-----

the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark,
within the EU. It will, among other things (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or
registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or
endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that
are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or
endorsed).

These reforms, including the Benchmarks Regulation, may cause such benchmarks to perform
differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be
predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a
benchmark, including the Senior Subordinated Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility, in
particular, if the methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply
with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation, such changes could, among other things, have
the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the
EURIBOR benchmark. In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or
the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of
administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark, including EURIBOR and LIBOR,
and complying with any such regulations or requirements.

Such factors may have the following effects on certain benchmarks such as EURIBOR: discourage
market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to such benchmark; trigger changes in
the rules or methodologies used in the benchmarks, or (iii) lead to the disappearance of the benchmark.
On July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12,
2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks
to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the "FCA Announcements").
The FCA Announcements indicate that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis, or at all, cannot
and will not be guaranteed after 2021. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other
benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law
enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, which could
require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any
debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a
result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or investigations, as well
as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported LIBOR, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating
rate debt linked to LIBOR and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR,
could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt (including the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility) or hedging. Any such adjustment, as well
as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in
reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that
bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any such consequence could have a material adverse impact
on the value of and return on our floating rate debt (including the Senior Subordinated Notes and our
New Revolving Credit Facility). In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may
result in our floating rate debt (including the Senior Subordinated Notes and our New Revolving Credit
Facility) performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR
or LIBOR had not developed.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if (1) there has been a
material disruption to EURIBOR, (2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or
permanently, (3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR, (4) an alternative rate
has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable
generally to floating rate notes or (5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a
third-party agent of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to holders of the Senior Subordinated
Notes using EURIBOR, (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an
independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an affiliate of the Issuer) as appointed
by the Issuer at the expense of the Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as
referred to under (a), the Issuer, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall
select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been
recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group
thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an
industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Senior Subordinated

98


-----

Notes (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably
practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of
the Senior Subordinated Notes as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR for use in calculating the
appropriate successor rate, which upon certification (by way of an officer's certificate) by the Issuer of
such rate to each of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying
Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Senior Subordinated Notes (upon which
each of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Paying Agent shall be
entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability
of any kind whatsoever) without any further action or consent by the noteholders or the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee. This means that interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes would be
determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at
the time you purchased the Senior Subordinated Notes issued on the Issue Date. See "Description of
_the Senior Subordinated Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest". The Senior Subordinated Notes_
Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective
judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) without the consent of the holders of such Senior Subordinated
Notes. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to
the interests of the holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes.

In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the
involvement of an independent financial institution, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture's
successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. If EURIBOR were
discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt (including the Senior
Subordinated Notes and our New Revolving Credit Facility) will be determined for the relevant period
by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt.

**Selected Historical Financial Data**

The following tables present selected historical consolidated financial information of the Issuer as well
as certain operating data. The selected historical consolidated financial information in the tables below
is derived from the Issuer's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020 prepared in accordance with IFRS and from the Issuer's unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January 31, 2021, which include
the unaudited comparative financial information for the six months ended January 31, 2020, prepared
in accordance with IAS 34, the standard of IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim
financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

The Issuer's audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Constantin Associés (member of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu Limited), the Issuer's statutory auditors for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The Issuer's
audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2019 and 2020 were
subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer's statutory auditors
for those years. The Issuer's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six
months ended January 31, 2021, which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the
six months ended January 31, 2020, were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and
Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer's statutory auditors for such period. For the consolidated financial
statements of the Issuer for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, an English translation
of the consolidated financial statements and a free English translation of the auditors' reports are
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. For the unaudited interim condensed consolidated
financial statements for the six months ended January 31, 2021, the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related auditor's report are included elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum.

The statutory auditors' report of Constantin Associés (member of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited)
and Ernst & Young et Autres on the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2018, without modifying the audit opinion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter
relating to Note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements relating to the impact of the revenue
recognition standard, IFRS 15, "Revenue from contracts with customers", adopted early by the Issuer
as of August 1, 2017. The statutory auditors' report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés
on the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, without
modifying the audit opinion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter drawing attention to the
uncertainty related to the tax adjustments received from the tax authorities concerning tax loss
carryforwards described in note 6.6.3 "Notifications, lawsuits and disputes" to the consolidated financial
statements. The statutory auditors' report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés on the
audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, without modifying the
audit opinion expressed therein, contains emphases of matter drawing attention to the matters disclosed
in note 4.1.1 "standards, amendments and interpretations as of August 1, 2019" to the consolidated
financial statements relating the impact of the mandatory implementation of IFRS 16 "Leases" by
August 1, 2019 and note 6.6.3 "Notification, lawsuits and disputes" to the consolidated financial
statements which present the uncertainty related to the tax adjustments received from the tax authorities
concerning tax loss carryforwards. The review report of Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés
on the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended January
31, 2021, without modifying the conclusion expressed therein, contains an emphasis of matter drawing
attention to the matter disclosed in note 6.3.2, which describes lawsuits, disputes and related
uncertainties.

In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil
discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in implementing the various components of
the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the
Optimil banner and focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a
potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018 and the disposal was
completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were
treated as discontinued operations in the income statement of our audited consolidated financial
statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were
not treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

The following tables should be read in conjunction with the information contained in "Presentation of

**_Overview_**

Our main business consists of our franchisor activity in the optical and hearing aid product markets. As
franchisor, we provide our franchisees with a full range of solutions and services, making our banners,
industry know-how and business practices available to them, while also marketing and promoting our
banners and offering a broad, appealing range of purchasing solutions, including exclusive product
offers. All of these products and services maintain brand appeal and pave the way for the development
of our franchisees.

In exchange for these services and the exclusive products provided to franchisees, we charge the cost
of goods as well as fees and other contributions to our franchisees (in accordance with franchise
agreements) and to network suppliers.

Furthermore, to support our banners and networks, we also directly own a number of optical and hearing
aid product stores. The three-part objective of our directly-owned stores is to support our franchisor
activity as follows:

    - maintain complete control over flagship stores in strategic areas in terms of customer bases,
as these stores are considered to be showcases for our banners;

    - operate a portfolio of stores to test new business initiatives, product concepts and
innovations and identify best practices in operations and distribution before rolling them out
across the network; and

    - manage the store network by temporarily operating stores where a franchisee is retiring or
experiencing financial difficulties. In these cases, we acquire the stores to keep them within
the network, with the objective of transferring them to new franchisees in the short- to midterm.

We recognize the following geographical segments in accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments:

    - **_France. The "France" segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of_**
franchised and directly-owned stores in France (as well as the activities of Malentille.com),
accounted for 78.0% of network sales and 76.0% of our revenue for the six months ended
January 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we had a total of 958 stores in France, of which
77 were directly-owned;

    - **_Spain._** The "Spain" segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of
franchised and directly-owned stores in Spain (including Andorra), accounted for 14.9% of
network sales and 19.8% of our revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2021. As of
January 31, 2021, we had a total of 336 stores in Spain, of which 77 were directly-owned
stores; and

    - **_Other countries._** The "Other countries" segment, which includes the optical business in
countries outside France and Spain, accounted for 7.1% of network sales and 4.1% of our
revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2021. As of January 31, 2021, we had a total
of 141 stores in our Other countries segment, of which six were directly-owned stores in
Portugal.

We generate revenue through (i) network sales revenue, mainly comprising fees, contributions and
other revenue collected by us on franchisee sales in exchange for the various services we provide them
as franchisor; (ii) network purchases revenue; and (iii) revenue from directly-owned stores. These
sources of revenue are further described below.

    - **_Network sales revenue (i). Network sales revenue is mainly derived from fees calculated_**
on the basis of a percentage of the sales reported by the network of franchised stores and
from initial one-time network entry fees. Network sales revenue represented 24.6% of our
revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2021 and 26.8% of network sales over the
same period. These fees and contributions mainly comprise the following items:

107


-----

o _Entry fees and royalties. Our store network benefits from the industry know-how and_
commercial expertise that we have developed over the years, as well as from our strong
brand recognition and reputation. We are responsible for formulating a commercial
strategy, which is supported by innovative offers, the development of products and
services and the sharing of best practices within the store network. In exchange for our
know-how, the right to use one of our brands and operate under one of our banners,
and the allocation of an exclusive geographical area, we charge franchisees an initial
one-time entry fee. For example, we charge entry fees of up to €50,000 for the Alain
Afflelou banner in France. For all of our banners, we charge monthly royalties which
are calculated as a percentage of a store's monthly sales excluding VAT, which, for
example, are set at a standard 4.15% rate for the Alain Afflelou banner in France and
4.23% rate for the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain.

o _Communications. We are responsible for the development and implementation of our_
network's advertising and communications strategy, using different types of media (TV,
radio) on a local level as well as on national levels to promote our brands, product
offerings and commercial offers. In exchange for the communications services we
provide, we receive communication fees from stores in the network, which are
calculated as a percentage of a store's monthly sales including VAT, which for example
are set at 7% for the Alain Afflelou banner in France (including VAT) and 8.34% for the
Alain Afflelou banner in Spain (excluding VAT). Communication activity also includes
special services charged to the store network as part of local communications
campaigns. In addition, revenue derived from communications activities includes sales
of display models of exclusive eyeglass frames to stores in the network (however, this
revenue is eliminated in the consolidation, as it is also reflected in our exclusive product
trading revenue).

o _Other._ These contributions comprise various services charged to the store network,
such as training and overhead (e.g., IT expenses), as well as various fees charged to
suppliers and service providers for network commercial offers.

- **_Network purchases revenue (ii)._** Network purchases revenue is derived from listing- and
licensing-related fees charged to suppliers on their sales to franchisees, and wholesale activity
consisting of product sales to franchisees through central purchasing units and our exclusive
eyeglass frames trading activity. Our network purchases revenue represented 47.4% of
revenue for the six months ended January 31, 2021 and 42.5% of network sales over the same
period. Network purchases revenue comprises the following types of revenue:

o _Central listing and payment units. Stores in the network are required to purchase all_
the products they sell exclusively from suppliers that are listed by our central listing and
payment units. On behalf of stores in the network, we negotiate purchasing terms with
these suppliers and operate central listing and payment units to optimize the supply
and payment of products for both suppliers and stores in the network. The central listing
and payment units afford suppliers the advantage of a single commercial and financial
counterparty for the entire network, in addition to guaranteed settlements from the
network's franchisees. In exchange for these listing and payment services, we charge
listed suppliers listing fees (comprising listing commissions, del credere commissions
relating to supplier payment guarantees and early payment allowances). Such listing
fees are calculated as a percentage of a listed supplier's sales to stores in the network.

o _Central purchasing units. Stores in the network purchase products either directly from_
listed suppliers or through our central purchasing units in France, Spain and Belgium.
Our central purchasing units primarily cover the purchase of eyeglass lenses, contact
lenses and Afflelou-exclusive frames and sunglasses. This system helps network
franchisees receive additional discounts, of which we receive a share.

o _Licensing._ We provide stores in the network our own-brand eyeglass lenses and
contact lenses, which are manufactured by third parties and distributed by us through
our central purchasing units or directly by listed suppliers. We charge third-party
manufacturers of our own-brand eyeglass lenses and contact lenses a licensing fee for
the use of certain brand names, such as Éphémère, which are calculated as a
percentage of the supplier's sales to stores in the network.

108


-----

o _Exclusive product trading._ We act as a wholesaler by selling exclusive frames and
sunglasses to stores in the network either through logistics providers or directly.
Exclusive products include: (i) proprietary frames and sunglasses, which are frames
and sunglasses selected by us, manufactured by subcontractors according to our
specifications and sold under our own brands, such as the "Afflelou" signature label;
(ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses, which are frames selected by us,
manufactured by subcontractors according to our specifications and marketed under
third-party brands; and (iii) other exclusive brands and third-party names, which are
designed and manufactured by third parties for exclusive distribution in the store
network. As part of our trading activities, we retain a margin on the sale of exclusive
frames and sunglasses to stores in the network.

  - We also generate revenue from sales to end customers at **_directly-owned stores (iii). The_**
directly-owned store network's contribution to our costs (such as rent and personnel costs) and
revenue represents a relatively substantial portion of overall costs and revenue, as it
corresponds to the costs and sales of the stores (borne by us), whereas the franchisor activity
is largely based on royalties collected from network sales and the sale of products to
franchisees. At January 31, 2021, we operated 77 directly-owned stores in France and 77
directly-owned stores in Spain, and six directly-owned stores in Other countries (in Portugal).
Revenue from directly-owned stores accounted for 28.0% of revenue for the six months ended
January 31, 2021.

**Key factors affecting our results of operations**

Set forth below are the main factors that have historically affected our results of operations and financial
position, and that may continue to do so in the future.

**_Network performances_**

Network sales include all optical and hearing aid sales generated by the stores bearing our various
banners and on our websites. A significant portion of our revenue is directly generated by network sales
(revenue from franchisees). Network sales are reported monthly by our franchisees in accordance with
the provisions of the franchise agreements. The various fees charged to franchisees, such as royalties
and communication fees, are calculated as a percentage of franchisee sales. The graphics below show
the evolution of our network sales across all geographies and includes all Alain Afflelou and Optical
Discount banner stores and hearing aid stores from July 31, 2016 to January 31, 2021 and the evolution
of our quarterly network sales (on a like-for-like basis) for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016 to July
31, 2020 and the three months ended October 31, 2020 and January 31, 2021.

Revenue from central purchasing and payment units is also related to network business, but indirectly
since such revenue is generated by charges to suppliers (listing and payment service fees, and
distribution royalties) related to network procurement or a margin retained on franchisee purchases
(central purchasing units and trading), and ultimately depends on competition of listed products with
those of other suppliers.

Network sales also depend on our presence and our ability to maintain such presence in care networks.
In the past, our presence in the care networks was more limited than its current level.

As a result, network sales are the main factor affecting our revenue, which in turn affects our results of
operations, particularly our profitability.

_Fiscal year ended July 31, 2020_

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, our network sales decreased by 14.8% to €697.1 million as
compared to €818.5 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. The Group network recorded near
zero sales from March 16 to May 11, 2020, and progressively began to recover during the second half
of May 2020. The cumulative impact of COVID-19 in March, April and May 2020 represented a total
deficit of sales of approximately €120 million from the year before, broadly corresponding to the total
network sales difference between the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 and the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019. On a monthly basis, the COVID-19 pandemic generated a deficit of sales of more than 40%
in March and May, and more than 90% in April. Excluding the months of March, April and May 2020,
our historical banner would have performed well, with growth in each of our main geographical areas,
even in France where sales in January were impacted by difficulties around the launch of 100% Santé.
The start of calendar year 2020 was affected by delays by the French Social Security system and private
health insurers in implementing the 100% Santé changes. In early January 2020, French health care
systems struggled to take the new classification codes of products into account, especially for lenses,
thus making it difficult for opticians to get the necessary information on reimbursement levels to end
customers and, consequently, to invoice end customers. As such, opticians were unable to invoice a
large volume of end customers at the beginning of calendar year 2020 and many end customers in turn
had to postpone their optical purchases. The effect of this situation was progressively absorbed during
the month of January 2020, with a limited number of private health insurers still having difficulties serving
end customers until the beginning of the initial COVID-19-related confinements in the spring of 2020.

In our discount segment, sales excluding March to May 2020 also decreased following a significant
reduction in the perimeter. Sales in the hearing aid sector (mostly consisting of our French business at
Alain Afflelou Acousticien) declined for the same reasons over the calendar year 2020, and also due to

110


-----

a more difficult environment due to customers holding out for the 100% Santé regulation changes which
were not fully implemented until January 2021.

France

Sales in France in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 decreased by 14.2%, due in large part to the
impact of COVID-19. For example, our French network experienced a 45.6%, 93.7% and 41.5% decline
in March, April and May, 2020, respectively, following the temporary closure of a vast majority of our
French stores until May 11, 2020. Sales in France were also affected in January 2020 by difficulties
around the launch of 100% Santé. As of mid-March 2020, those difficulties had been largely resolved,
but some of the sales deferred in January still remained unfulfilled when the first COVID-19-related
confinements took effect. We believe that the sales recovery since the reopening of our stores also
benefitted from the postponement of sales due to the aforementioned difficulties around the settlement
of 100% Santé.

Finally, sales were also impacted by the regulation changes around 100% Santé which mainly resulted
in the creation of a zero cost range of products (known as "Segment A" in the optical sector and
"Segment I" in the hearing aid sector) for the end customer, and the cut in the maximum frame
reimbursement from €150 to €100. While it is difficult to assess each of those three elements affecting
our sector at this point, the sector performance as measured by Observatoire de l'Optique showed a
comparable evolution of our banner with the total market, at respectively -28.2% for the market and 26.7% at Alain Afflelou France (for the first seven months of the 2020 calendar year) and -14.2% for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 (on a year-to-date basis at the end of calendar year 2020). We
believe that the impact on the market of these 100% Santé changes to be limited to a one-off negative
impact of approximately 2% in 2020, as frames only represent 25% of the average customer basket;
thus far, uptake on RAC Zéro is broadly in line with our expectations, with slightly lower impact on
frames sales than expected. The measure is expected to impact 5% to 10% of frames France sold in
France.

Our discount banner recorded a 28.4% decline of its sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, due
to the combination of the total store count reduction and the impact of COVID-19 in the second of half
of the fiscal year. Finally, our sales in the hearing aid business recorded a decline for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2020 of 13.9%, still above the market which recorded a total decrease of 19.9%, mainly
due to the difficult sector environment since mid-2019 after several years of solid growth and the impact
of COVID-19, which especially affected the hearing aid business.

Spain

Sales in Spain decreased by 13.8% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. As in France, sales would
have been positive, but for the months of March to May 2020, which were deeply impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic (i.e. the other nine months of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 showed an
increase in sales). The sales impact of COVID-19 on our network in Spain has been more significant
than in France, as our network includes a higher proportion of stores in large urban areas and in malls
than in France, mainly as a result of our historical base (Alain Afflelou Optico was founded from the
former network Optica Carrefour). We also recorded a strong recovery, as in France, in June and July
2020. Nevertheless, given the greater impact of discretionary sales in Spain (sunglasses) and the
absence of a supportive healthcare system like the one in France, we still remain cautious about our
network sales in Spain. Finally, our hearing aid banner was re-launched after the termination of our
master franchise agreement in the preceding fiscal year. While performing well, our development has
been slowed by COVID-19 which has made it more difficult to open new stores, to locate and onboard
new franchisees and to perform refurbishments.

Other countries

Sales in the Other countries segment declined by 12.6% for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.
Switzerland had a positive impact on performance in this segment, with the re-opening of our network
in May 2020, and positive evolution of sales in the last quarter. On the other hand, our network in
Portugal continued to be significantly affected due to the combination of lower discretionary sales and
tourist deficit.

_Six months ended January 31, 2021_

In the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, our network sales increased by 10.5% to €428.8
million, as compared to €388.0 million during the six months ended January 31, 2020. Our historical
optical banner grew by 10.2% in the first half of this fiscal year, slightly slowing down in the second

111


-----

quarter of this fiscal year, mainly as a consequence of the second confinement in late Autumn 2020
and curfew measures that were put in place in January 2021. Despite a slight decrease in the second
quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, network sales in our discount segment in France
increased slightly in the first half of the year (a 0.2% increase as compared with the first half of the prior
fiscal year (with the increase occurring in the first quarter of the fiscal year, offset by a slight decrease
in the second quarter)), a lower growth than the historical banner mainly due to perimeter reductions.
Our hearing aid activity, which is mostly covered by our Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner in France,
continued to perform well, growing by 26.3% over the first half of the fiscal year as compared with the
first half of the prior fiscal year.

France

During the 2020 calendar year, network sales in our French Alain Afflelou optical banner were impacted
by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total decline of 12.0% to €488.8 million (excl. VAT), as compared to
€555.7 million in the prior calendar year. This decline was slightly lower than the decline across the
optical market overall (13.0% as estimated by Observatoire de l'Optique). Alain Afflelou continued to
perform well in its market, despite a decline in January 2020 due to technical difficulties related to the
implementation of 100% Santé.

Network sales in our discount banner also declined over the 2020 calendar year, to €33.1 million as
compared with €42.7 million in the previous calendar year, i.e. a decline of 22.6%, due to the
combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and perimeter reductions. Finally, our hearing aid banner
sales amounted to €38.3 million (excl. VAT) over the 2020 calendar year, down only 1.0% as compared
with the previous calendar year, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. During the 2020 calendar year, our
hearing aid banner benefited from the re-launch of our Tchin Tchin offer at the end of the calendar year
2019. Also, we think our progress on digital transformation, including improved tools for booking
appointments, and efforts to forge a closer link with hearing aid users contributed to our strong
performance. The first month of activity after the 100% Santé changes came into effect in calendar year
2021 showed good performance, and we expect the switch to the RAC zéro offer for a basic pair of
hearing aids will have a strong positive impact on the hearing aid market in 2021, taking full effect
progressively over the calendar year.

During the second quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, our network sales in France increased
by 8.6% as compared with the second quarter of the previous year. In November 2020, sales were nearly
stable as compared to November 2019, reflecting strong underlying performance despite the impact of
confinement measures that impacted traffic in stores especially in shopping centers, while December
2020 and January 2021 collectively showed a strong increase versus the prior year.

Spain

During the 2020 calendar year, network sales in our Spanish Alain Afflelou banner decreased by 11.7%,
as compared with an overall market drop of 18.3%, as estimated by GfK. Our network sales in Spain
have been fairly resilient, with a more vigorous rebound (1.2%) than the wider market (-2.2%, according
to GfK) after the confinement period in the second half of the calendar year, due in part to large
communication campaigns and commercial offers like Magic and buy one and get two additional pairs
_for one euro that supported the reopening of our stores. Additionally, discretionary sales declines (such_
as sunglasses, contact lenses and other than corrective glasses products) had a deeper impact in the
wider sector than at Alain Afflelou, given a historical lower proportion of those sales (27% of the market
as estimated by GfK in 2019, versus 22% at Alain Afflelou) and a stronger mid-range positioning at
Alain Afflelou through our own products collections. In the 2020 calendar year, corrective glasses sales
decreased by 8.3% at Alain Afflelou, as compared to a wider market decline of 12.7% as estimated by
GfK, and discretionary sales decreased by 23.9% at Alain Afflelou, as compared to a wider market
decline of 33.2% as estimated by GfK.

In the second quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, network sales in Spain declined by 2.2%
as compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year and grew by 1.8% in the first half of the current
fiscal year as compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year. Sales in Spain were affected in November
2020 in a similar way to France, due to a second confinement being imposed. Thanks to lightening of
confinement measures in December 2020, our network sales in Spain recovered strongly, with an
overall positive evolution of sales in November 2020 and December 2020, but in January 2021, our
activity was impacted by heavy snowfall in the Madrid region.

Other countries

112


-----

In the second quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, network sales in the Other countries
segment grew by 2.7% as compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year and grew by 7.1% in
the first half of the fiscal year as compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year, with our BeLux and
Swiss networks showing a growth of 11.5%, consistent with the French network.

**_Expansion of store network_**

Our store network includes all optical and hearing aid stores bearing our various banners. The size of
the store network directly impacts network sales. The number of stores in the network increases through
opening new stores under the existing banners in the markets where we operate and by adding new
banners to the network.

The following table provides a breakdown of the store network (including directly-owned stores) by
geographical area for the periods indicated:

_Fiscal year ended July 31, 2020_

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the Group's store count grew by four stores from 1,425 stores at
the end of July 2019 to 1,429 stores at the end of July 2020, with solid growth of the Alain Afflelou
optical and hearing aid banners, attenuated by the reduction of our discount network (reduction of 13
stores in our Optical Discount banner). Our development has been slowed by the COVID-19 pandemic,
which delayed the openings of several stores. Finally, the Group continued to reduce the number of
directly-owned stores, with 151 stores as of July 31, 2020, as compared to 162 as of July 31, 2019.

France

Our French network increased by three stores over the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. The Alain
Afflelou optical banner comprised 760 stores as of July 31, 2020 (compared to 752 stores in the prior
fiscal year). The hearing aid business also continued to expand significantly, both in terms of dedicated
stores (90 stores, compared to 81 stores in the prior fiscal year) and corners (222 corners, compared
to 202 corners in the prior fiscal year). On the whole, the hearing aid network accounted for 312 points
of sale at the end of July 2020 (compared to 283 points of sale in the prior fiscal year). Finally, the
Optical Discount banner continued to decrease to 111 stores at the end of July 2020 (compared to 124
stores in the prior fiscal year), as a consequence of our strategy to right-size the number of opticians in
our networks in order to maintain only the number of opticians actually required by the Group.

Spain

In Spain, our store count was stable (as compared to the prior fiscal year) at 328 stores at the end of
July 2020. Following our decision to re-launch our hearing aid business, the network grew by seven
points of sale to 43 at the end of both July 2019 and 2020, of which three were dedicated stores and
40 were corners (compared to two stores and 34 corners in the prior fiscal year).

Other countries

Our network in the Other countries has also been stable, at 140 stores at the end of both July 2019 and
2020. We continued to develop in promising areas, like Kuwait, where a third store was opened. In Asia
and South America, our plans have been put on hold, due to the deep impact of COVID-19 on our
activity. Other areas have been broadly stable.

113


-----

_Six months ended January 31, 2021_

Our total store count increased by 18 stores to 1,435 stores as of January 31, 2021 as compared to
1,417 stores as of January 31, 2020. This increase corresponds to the expansion of our historical
banner in each geographical area.

France

Our total store count in France increased by eight stores in the second quarter of the current fiscal year
as compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year and decreased by one store as compared to
October 31, 2020. Our total store count in France continues to be affected by the reduction of our
discount banner, which accounted for 97 stores as of January 31, 2021, as compared to 104 stores as
of October 31, 2020 and 106 stores as of January 31, 2020. Our Alain Afflelou banner reached a historic
record of 768 optical stores as of January 31, 2021, as compared to 754 as of January 31, 2020, which
we believe demonstrates the renewed attractiveness of our banner. Our hearing aid banner also
continued to expand, with an increase of 5 points of sale (two corners and three dedicated stores) over
the last twelve months. As of January 31, 2021, the hearing aids business accounted for a total of 311
points of sale in France, of which 90 were dedicated stores. The Group continues to expand the Alain
Afflelou banner in France, successfully combining the two businesses in the optical and hearing sector.
The historical brand Alain Afflelou has added 93 stores since July 2016, reaching 858 optical and
hearing aids stores as of January 31, 2021, versus 765 as of July 31, 2016. We continued to rationalize
our discount banner, with the aim of bringing the discount stores network up to date with our standards
for store concept and commercial policy. We will continue in the coming months to terminate franchise
agreements for stores in our discount banner that do not fit our requirements and are not aligned with
our pricing concept. In certain cases, where the franchisee and the local presence of Alain Afflelou permit
it, the Group may elect to transform certain Optical Discount stores into Alain Afflelou stores.

Spain

In Spain, our store network gained four stores in the second quarter of the current fiscal year as
compared to the prior quarter, with 336 stores as of January 31, 2021 as compared with 332 stores at
the end of October 2020, and gained nine stores as compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal
year. Our Spanish hearing aid network also grew by 22 points of sale (including corners and dedicated
stores), with 59 points of sale as compared with 37 points of sale as of January 31, 2020.

Other countries

Our store network in our Other countries segment grew by two stores in the second quarter of the
current fiscal year, with 141 stores as of January 31, 2021 as compared with 139 stores as of October
31, 2020. In the last twelve months, we notably increased our presence in Switzerland by two stores,
and added one store in Kuwait, which we believe is a promising geographical area.

**_Like-for-like network sales growth_**

The growth in like-for-like network sales for a given period corresponds to the increase in sales in stores
which were open throughout the entire relevant period under consideration and the entire prior year and
for which no substantial changes (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more
than one month) or closures have occurred during the period under consideration.

In addition to expanding network sales generally, like-for-like network sales growth is another important
indicator of the performance of our store network. For a definition of like-for-like network sales growth,
see footnote 4 under "Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—
_Operating and segment information". In countries, such as France and Spain, where we already have_
a significant store network, the size of the existing network plays a critical role in the overall growth of
network sales. Further illustrating this, in a given period new stores only account for a small percentage
of network sales. We analyze network sales growth on a like-for-like basis in France, Spain and the
Other countries segment in order to assess the evolution of the performance of existing stores,
excluding the effects of network expansion.

Growth in like-for-like network sales is due in part to our implementation of commercial offers and
policies and the marketing communications that promote them, but is also due to the initiatives of local
stores run by franchisees, which receive additional support from our sales management teams.

Like-for-like network sales correspond to sales generated by stores which were open throughout the
periods under review, based on a full fiscal year, and which did not undergo any substantial changes

during such periods (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than
one month), in order for sales performance in a period to be comparable to that of the prior period. The
calculation of like-for-like network sales does not take store closures in connection with COVID-19 into
account. Like-for-like network sales are calculated at constant exchange rates (applying the prior year's
exchange rates to the current year), as a very small portion of network sales are currently exposed to
currency risk. Like-for-like network sales growth has not been adjusted based on the potential impact
on network sales resulting from the different number of working days between two periods.

The following table presents a breakdown of like-for-like network sales growth by geographical area for
the periods indicated:

**For the six months ended**
**For the fiscal year ended July 31,**
**January 31,**

In general, growth in like-for-like network sales is itself influenced by several factors, including:

  - _Population and lifestyle dynamics. Sales volumes are correlated with population growth and_
aging. Population growth in the geographical regions in which we operate will likely result in
increased demand for optical products. Aging of the population is also expected to result in
increased demand for optical products and hearing aids. As a person ages, the need for optical
products and hearing aids increases due to age-related far-sightedness and hearing loss. It is
estimated that, by 2025, 46.7% of the French population and 52.7% of the Spanish population
will be over age 45 and that 56% of each of the French population and 53% of the Spanish
population will wear prescription glasses (as compared to 54% and 52% in 2020, respectively,
and 51% and 48% in 2012, respectively). See "Industry—The optical product market—Our
_optical product geographic markets". In addition, in France, we believe the implementation of_
changes to RAC Zéro will be a source of significant growth in demand for hearing aids, as such
expensive devices will become more affordable, driving volume and demand. Evolving social
habits and lifestyle patterns, such as growing exposure to digital displays, headphones and
noisy environments, as well as increasing eye and hearing health awareness, are also expected
to continue to support demand for optical products and hearing aids. Internationally, similar
trends in population and lifestyle dynamics are also increasing demand for optical products and
hearing aids.

  - _Technology. Sales are affected by the availability of technologically innovative products in our_
product range due to customer demand for the latest technology in optical products. In past
decades, there have been significant advances in technology, which have had a positive impact
on average basket size. Progressive lenses, photochromatic lenses (i.e., which darken
automatically when exposed to sunlight and fade to clear lenses when indoors), polycarbonate
lenses (thinner, lighter and more impact-resistant than standard plastic lenses), anti-reflective
and anti-scratch lens coatings, break-resistant optical frames (designed with flexible joints and
materials that allow a greater degree of bending than conventional frames) and new materials
used for contact lenses such as silicon hydrogel are examples of the technologically innovative
products sought by customers. We notably expect that over time, as the general population
ages, the increase in the penetration rate of progressive lenses will lead to an increase in the
average basket for optical products.

  - _Overall economic conditions. The network's optical product sales have historically been_
affected by overall macroeconomic conditions and the resulting effects on household
consumption. These effects may be particularly significant in countries where the level of
reimbursement by insurance systems is low or non-existent, which is the case for most of the
markets in which we operate, except France, our largest market. In certain instances,
customers have responded to the uncertainty and volatility stemming from macroeconomic
conditions by delaying their spending on optical products, which explains the longer product

renewal cycle observed during challenging economic times. Generally, the renewal cycle for
optical products decreases when overall economic conditions start to improve, leading to
positive like-for-like network sales growth. Hearing aid product sales are also influenced by
prices, as these products are only partially reimbursed in France (although the implementation
of changes to RAC Zéro will make these more affordable, driving volume and demand) and not
reimbursed at all in Spain.

  - _Regulatory environment._ Changes in the regulatory environment impact sales (see
"Regulation"). This is especially the case in France, where certain regulatory developments
have in the past facilitated access to optical products by reducing administrative barriers to
optical prescriptions (see "Regulation"). For a discussion of recent changes in the regulatory
environment in France, see "Regulation—Regulations governing the French complementary
_health insurance system"._

_Fiscal year ended July 31, 2018_

The Group's like-for-like network sales grew by 1.5% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. While
in France our positive performance can be partly attributed to the positive impact of the Alain Afflelou
network's expansion into closed care networks, since 2015, the increase across almost all our
geographies in the three past fiscal years demonstrates the positive trend in the Alain Afflelou banner.

France

During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, our Alain Afflelou banner recorded strong network sales in
June and July, after a slowdown in the third quarter. Store traffic and network sales benefited from the
success of our Smart Tonic offer, which we have since renamed "Magic", supported by a commercial
campaign featuring Sharon Stone, and our traditional summer campaign (two additional pairs of glasses
at one euro). Additionally, the hearing aid banner performed well in terms of like-for-like network sales,
after more moderate network sales growth in previous quarters partly due to network expansion, which
led to cannibalization of part of the existing store base. Like-for-like network sales in France grew by
1.5% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 as compared to a growth of 3.7% during the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2017.

Spain

Network sales increased by 1.5% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.
Like in France, recent network sales performance can be attributed to the success of our commercial
campaigns and the continued success of our Smart Tonic offer, which we have since renamed "Magic".
Additionally, we believe that Spanish customers react more to commercial innovation, as they do not
have a health care system comparable to the French system which generally flattens such trends.

Other countries

Network sales in the Other countries segment increased by 0.6% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2018. After the slowdown in network sales in Belgium, partly due to aggressive
commercial policies of the two market leaders, our performance in Belgium during the last quarter of
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 was positive, alongside positive performance in the other areas,
resulting in growth in this segment.

_Fiscal year ended July 31, 2019_

The Group's network like-for-like sales grew by 5.1% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

France

In France, the network recorded growth of 4.8% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Each banner
grew significantly. In particular, the Alain Afflelou banner recorded performance sustained by our
commercial campaign on _Magic featuring Sharon Stone, and our traditional summer campaign (two_
additional pairs of glasses at one euro) at the end of the fiscal year. Like-for-like sales in the discount
banner grew more slowly in an improved market environment from the start of the calendar year. In
addition, our like-for-like sales in the hearing aid banner recorded a negative performance. We believe
this is mainly the consequence of the anticipation by the end-customers of the coming changes to RAC
_Zéro, which will enable them to get equipment for free in calendar year 2021, versus an average burden_
of approximately €800. Over the long term, we expect that the changes to RAC Zéro will have neutral
impact on our sales of glasses in France. Also, our performance has been hit by the absence of a
strong commercial campaign and offers, and we believe our like-for-like sales in this segment are partly

116


-----

affected by a cannibalization effect, due to the lack of hearing aid specialists. The optical market was
almost stable in 2018 (having grown by 0.1%) and recorded growth of 2.0% from January to July 2019,
in each case according to GfK, which we believe was the consequence of three past years of stagnation,
despite structural growth factors linked to demographics. Finally, our hearing aid banner continued to
outperform the French market, recording 14.1% growth, versus a slightly negative market performance
of 0.6%, according to GfK, over the same period.

Spain

In Spain, network sales increased by 5.5% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019. As is the case in France, our Spanish sales performance can be attributed to the success of our
commercial campaigns and the success of our Magic offer.

Other countries

Network sales in the Other countries segment increased by 7.0% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2019. Like-for-like sales in Belgium and Switzerland recorded levels of like-for-like
growth of 6.8% and 12.3%, respectively, confirming the positive trend of the fiscal year.

_Fiscal year ended July 31, 2020_

The Group's network like-for-like sales decreased by 14.1% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. This
decline is mainly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected all our geographies.

France

In France, the network recorded a decline of 14.4% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Following
the re-opening of our network from May 11, 2020, each banner grew significantly in like-for-like sales
in June and July 2020. The Alain Afflelou banner recorded high single digit growth of like-for-like sales
in June and July 2020. Like-for-like sales in the discount banner grew even more rapidly in June and
July, given a lower proportion of stores within malls which continued to lack traffic after the end of the
initial confinement period. Finally, like-for-like sales in the hearing aid market recovered, thus almost
being stable in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and over-performing the market over the fiscal year.

Over the fiscal year, our optical banners were broadly aligned with the market (as measured by
_Observatoire de l'Optique as down by 14.5% and GfK as down by 13.9%). Three main elements have_
impacted our market and our networks since the start of the calendar year:

 - First, our sales were affected by technical difficulties around the settlement of 100% Santé
changes, in January, during which sales decreased significantly. While progressively being
caught up in February and March 2020, we believe after the re-opening we continued to capture
some clients who had been unable to purchase in January 2020 due to the difficulties described
above in connection with the implementation of 100% Santé.

 - Second, we think that the 100% Santé changes have not yet had their full impact, given the
troubled environment during the 2020 calendar year. While the volume of sales of RAC Zéro
offers (either glasses or only frames or lenses with no out of pocket expense) broadly correspond
to our expectations of 15% to 20% of total glasses volumes, the impact on our sales has been
limited.

 - Finally, COVID-19 affected the whole sector, but with specific impacts depending on various
criteria, such as geographical exposure, location of our stores and the distribution of sales in a
given store. For instance, the absence of international tourism had a significant negative impact
on the biggest store in our network (Champs Elysées). Discretionary sales, like sunglasses,
continued to underperform after the reopening, showing a decline 17% or €0.9 million in June
and July 2020 (as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year). In terms of location, the
stores in large malls and shops located in metropolitan business districts (such as La Défense in
Paris or La Part Dieu in Lyon) were still missing customer traffic, as the population working in
those areas considerably decreased as a result of work-from-home measures.

Spain

In Spain, network sales decreased by 12.7% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July
31, 2020. As is the case in France, sales reacted strongly in June and July 2020, after the initial
reopening. Nonetheless, our network declined by 37% in terms of sunglasses sales for the fiscal year,
with a loss of €0.7 million of sales in June and July 2020. Finally, there was a negative spread of 3% in
like-for-like sales evolution between our stores in malls, due to lack of traffic, and the rest of our portfolio.

117


-----

Other countries

Network sales in the Other countries segment decreased by 13.7% on a like-for-like basis during the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Our Belgian network recorded a larger decline on the fiscal year than
our French network, although it had overperformed the year before. Our Swiss network continued to
perform well, with growth in like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter, and a total decline at only 5.8% for
the fiscal year. In Portugal, like-for-like sales during the fiscal year were broadly aligned with the French
network. Finally, the other areas showed mixed performances. In Africa, where we had 32 stores at the
end of the fiscal year, our evolution generally followed France. Each of our stores in Kuwait continued
to grow while our stores in Asia and Colombia were more significantly negatively impacted.

_Six months ended January 31, 2021_

Our like-for-like network sales increased by 10.0% in the first half of the current fiscal year as compared
with decline of 1.8% in the same period of the prior fiscal year, with cumulative growth in each
geographical area for the first half of the current fiscal year. This strong performance despite the COVID19 pandemic (which was weighted more heavily to the first quarter and slowed somewhat in the second
quarter) further demonstrates the resilience of our business and the non-discretionary, healthcare nature
of the optical and hearing aid products we sell. In addition, the prior period reflected a particularly difficult
trading environment in France, as discussed further below.

France

On a cumulative basis, like-for-like network sales increased by 12.4% during the first half of the fiscal
year ending July 31, 2021 (which increase was weighted more heavily to the first quarter and slowed
somewhat in the second quarter), as compared with decline of 2.7% the first half of the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020. Each of our optical banners grew by almost 8% during the second quarter of the fiscal
year ending July 31, 2021, while our hearing aid banner continued to recover in spite of the COVID-19
pandemic and the 100% Santé changes in the hearing aid market that took effect in January 2021 and
which led a number of customers to defer purchase in the first two months of the quarter. The Alain
Afflelou optical banner showed a similar positive evolution as compared to our discount banner, as its
overperformance was partly offset by a stronger presence in large shopping centers, which have been
more impacted by lack of traffic.

In the six months ended January 31, 2021, our main optical banner outperformed the French and
Spanish optical markets, with our French Alain Afflelou banner's like-for-like network sales growth
reaching 14.0% (as compared to overall French optical market growth of 10.5%) and our Spanish Alain
Afflelou banner's like-for-like network sales growth reaching 1.8% (as compared with over all Spanish
market growth of negative 1.1%) (as estimated by Observatoire de l'Optique and GfK, respectively). Our
discount banner was broadly in line with the optical market in terms of like-for-like sales. Stores in large
shopping centers underperformed versus the network in terms of like-for-like sales, with an increase of
only 3.4% in the first half of this fiscal year and in the whole fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions in shopping centers, we expect these stores to continue to
underperform while such restrictions are in place. However, we believe that part of this business will
continue to temporarily re-direct to other locations in our network which have remained open.

Our optical banners in France have again demonstrated their resilience when viewed on a month- bymonth basis, especially in November 2020, when like-for-like sales were essentially stable as compared
to the same month of the prior fiscal year, with the second confinement period largely impacting traffic
areas like shopping centers and large city centers. December and January were exceptional months in
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 due to the changes around 100% Santé; in December 2020 and
January 2021, our French network sales performed well overall, which we believe stems from a
continuing "catch up" effect from the first French confinement. Finally, our French hearing aid banner
continued to grow in the second quarter of the current fiscal year (with a cumulative growth of 16.4% in
like-for-like sales in the first half of this fiscal year), with a particularly strong performance (22.5% growth
in like-for-like network sales as compared to the same period in 2020) in January 2021, which gives us
an encouraging outlook on the 100% Santé changes that took effect from January 2021. This positive
trend continued in February and March, despite the partial restrictive measures put in place in France
to respond to a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, with like-for-like sales growth totaling more than
25% in both months. As we see in the number of appointments, which gives an early indication of coming
activity, we think the positive trends corresponding to new hearing aid users thanks to the 100% Santé

changes will continue to last in the near future. On the whole, our hearing aid banner has recorded
monthly like-for-like sales growth above 5% each month since June 2020.

Spain

In Spain, like-for-like network sales decreased by 3.6% during the second quarter of the current fiscal
year as compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year and increased by 0.8% in the first half
of the current fiscal year as compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year. While like-for-like sales in
January 2021 declined by 16.5%, largely due to heavy snowfall in the Madrid region, sales in December
2020 overperformed as compared to the same months in the prior fiscal year. On the whole, the banner
performed well during periods not affected either by restrictive measures or heavy snowfall (January
2021), with over 7% in monthly like-for-like sales growth (in September, October and December).

Other countries

Like-for-like network sales in our Other countries segment increased by 2.3% during the second quarter
of the current fiscal year as compared to the second quarter of the prior fiscal year and 7.4% in the first
half of the current fiscal year as compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year. Belgium performed well,
with a cumulative like-for-like sales growth of 18.6% in the first half of the current fiscal year as
compared to the first half of the prior fiscal year. Switzerland recorded slightly positive like-for-like sales
growth at 0.2% during the first half of the fiscal year, the difference partly stemming from a higher base
than the year before (a 3.9% increase in the first half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020), and also an
earlier recovery after the first confinement. Lastly, like-for-like sales declined in the other geographical
areas in our Other countries segment in the second quarter of the fiscal year and in the first half of this
fiscal year, mainly due to a late impact of COVID-19, as was the case in Portugal.

**_Other factors affecting our results of operations_**

Business model and new services and offers

Our ability to pivot our franchise business model, and in particular our ability to develop and offer new
services to our franchisees and suppliers, across all our networks and geographies, has historically
had, and may in the future have, a significant impact on our results of operations.

Average franchise and communication fees can change as our network changes. For example, when
long-standing franchisees, which are often subject to historical royalty rates that are lower than current
rates, retire and are replaced with new franchisees, we are able to obtain more favorable terms.
Concerning revenue from franchisees, the addition of new banners (Optical Discount and Alain Afflelou
Acousticien) that may have lower royalty rates impacts our average franchise fees as a whole. In
general, we invoice higher franchise and communication fees under the Alain Afflelou banner in France
than under other banners and in Other countries, reflecting the banner's strong brand recognition and
considerable know-how. Newer banners (Alain Afflelou Acousticien) or smaller banners (Optical
Discount) generally incur higher advertising expenditures in order to foster brand awareness and drive
footfall.

Additionally, we are progressively extending to all of our banners the central listing and payment unit
already in place for the Alain Afflelou banner in France and Spain, which covers all of franchisees'
purchases, as well as a central purchasing unit that helps franchisees to optimize the cost of purchases
and boost their margins. Moreover, our ability to improve the terms of our agreements with suppliers,
primarily attributable to the volume of purchases made by our banners, may have an impact on our
results.

The roll-out of a line of exclusive products, notably through our trading activities can also have an effect
on our network sales and revenue. Our ability to improve the penetration rate of these products in the
overall purchases of franchisees in our network increases our revenue and profitability. Likewise,
exclusive products are to be further developed alongside other offers already deployed throughout the
network, including the discount and hearing aid banners.

Directly-owned stores

Any changes in sales at directly-owned stores impact our revenue, results of operations and financial
position. Directly-owned store sales are included in network sales and are also impacted by the factors
described above. The contribution of directly-owned stores to our costs and revenue represents a
relatively substantial portion of overall costs and revenue, as it mainly corresponds to the costs and
sales of these stores directly borne by us. Changes in the number of directly-owned stores therefore
affect our cost structure and revenue generation.

119


-----

Our strategy for directly-owned stores is based around three major objectives: (i) retaining control over
flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies; (ii) having a store network to test new
business initiatives and identify best practices in operations and distribution before applying them to the
franchisees; and (iii) managing the overall store network when the need arises, through supporting
locations where the franchisee is either retiring or experiencing financial difficulties to keep them under
our banners. Setting and achieving these objectives is part of the overall management strategy for the
network and involves specific costs, but it contributes to increasing the profitability of the entire franchise
activity. Changes in the initiatives or the number of directly-owned stores could therefore impact our
future results.

**Factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations**

**_Changes in our scope of consolidation_**

We consummate acquisitions from time to time to take advantage of opportunities to increase our
market share in existing markets or to enter adjacent geographies or complementary markets. Our
management believes that acquisitions enhance the benefits of scale in our industry, particularly with
respect to purchasing power, inventory management and logistics as well as general operational
synergies. We typically seek synergies from acquisitions relating to the geographical coverage and
density of our store network, supplier relationships and product offerings that allow us to expand our
offering to both franchisees and end-customers, distribution capabilities (for example, with respect to ecommerce platforms) and general and administrative costs, among others.

In addition to organic growth of our store network, we have consummated certain acquisitions which
have resulted in changes to our scope of consolidation during the periods under review.

In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil
discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in implementing the various components of
the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the
Optimil banner and focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a
potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018 and the disposal was
completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were
treated as discontinued operations in the income statement of our audited consolidated financial
statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were
not treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

**Adoption of IFRS 16 (Leases)**

We have applied the IFRS 16 (Leases) standard from August 1, 2019 using the retrospective simplified
method, with no restatement of comparative information. As a result of the application of IFRS 16, we
recognized non-current assets and current assets of €76.4 million and €1.6 million, respectively, and
non-current liabilities and current liabilities of €71.0 million and €14.6 million, respectively, as of August
1, 2019. The recognition of expense as depreciation and interest rather than rental expense, resulted
in a decrease in Rental expense and an increase in EBITDA of €15.0 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020. Due to the difference in timing of expense recognition (expense is front-loaded under
IFRS 16 as interest expense is greater at the beginning of the lease), the total impact on Net loss before
tax of consolidated companies was a loss of €0.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. In
respect to the consolidated statement of cash flows, operating cash flows increased as a result of the
application of IFRS 16, and financing cash flows decreased, as repayment of the principal portion of
the lease liabilities are now classified as cash flows from financing activities.

**Non-IFRS performance indicators**

In assessing the performance of our business, our management considers a variety of performance
and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are like-forlike network sales growth (as discussed above under "—Key factors affecting our results of operations—
_Like-for-like network sales growth"), store count (as discussed above under "—Key factors affecting our_
_results of operations—Expansion of store network")_ and Adjusted EBITDA. Such indicators are not
recognized measures of financial performance under IFRS. See "Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information—Other Financial Measures" and "Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information_
_and Other Data—Other Financial Information" for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating_
income from ordinary activities.

(1) In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in
implementing the various components of the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the Optimil banner and
focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018
and the disposal was completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were treated as discontinued operations in
the income statement of our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were not
treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

The Group's Adjusted EBITDA increased by €4.8 million, or 6.1%, to €83.8 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019 as compared to €79.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The increase
was linked to network sales growth.

The Group's Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) decreased by €28.2 million, or 33.7%, to €55.6 million
(€70.6 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 (as compared to €83.8 million for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019). The decrease was mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its
impact on our sales performance. Sales in France in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 decreased by
15.3%, due in large part to the impact of COVID-19. For example, our French network experienced a
40% decline in May 2020 following the temporary closure of the vast majority of our French stores until
May 11, 2020. Sales in France were also affected in January 2020 by difficulties around the launch of
100% Santé. As of mid-March 2020, those difficulties had been largely resolved, but some of the sales
deferred in January 2020 still remained unfulfilled when the first COVID-19-related confinement took
effect. We believe that the sales recovery since the reopening of our stores also benefitted from the
postponement of sales due to the aforementioned difficulties around the settlement of 100% Santé.

Adjusted EBITDA declined by €0.5 million, or 2.0%, from €26.7 million for the second quarter of the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 to €26.2 million for the second quarter of the year ending July 31, 2021,
and increased by €4.7 million, from €47.7 million in the first half of the prior fiscal year to €52.4 million in
the first half of the current fiscal year. The decrease in the second quarter was mainly due to a decrease
of €0.7 million in Spain, while other geographical areas were stable overall. On the whole, Adjusted
EBITDA during the second quarter was affected by a €0.7 million decline at our directly-owned stores in
France and Spain, due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting traffic in shopping centers and tourist
areas, where we have a higher proportion of directly-owned stores as compared to the rest of the
network. In the first half of the current fiscal year, our Group has generated adjusted EBITDA growth of
9.9%, consistent with the overall network sales growth of 10.5%.

_France_

Adjusted EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) generated in France increased by €2.2 million, or 3.2%,
from €67.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €69.5 million for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, performances at our historical banner grew broadly
in line with network sales. On the other hand, performances at our discount banner were impacted by
the reduction in the perimeter. The hearing aid banner continued to improve its profitability (as
compared to the prior fiscal year), reaching breakeven EBITDA for the fiscal year, as compared to a
loss of €1.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, despite the recent slowdown in terms of
network sales. Finally, the directly-owned stores structure also improved its profitability, after the
reduction of the perimeter, including the closing down of non-performing stores.

Adjusted EBITDA generated in France decreased by €22.7 million or 32.7%, from €69.5 million for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €46.8 million (pre-IFRS 16; €56.8 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2020. Profitability linked to our Alain Afflelou optical network was stronger than the
Optical Discount banner, which was also impacted by a strong reduction of its perimeter, and Alain

-----

Afflelou Acousticien, our hearing aid banner, which was impacted by a more difficult environment,
through the fiscal year, due to the anticipation of 100% Santé changes. Additionally, our directly-owned
stores were strongly impacted by the lack of traffic in shopping centers and big stores like at Champs
Elysées, which generally have high levels of rents.

Adjusted EBITDA generated in France was stable at €21.3 million for the second quarter of the fiscal
year ending July 31, 2021. Network sales in the second quarter of the current fiscal year grew by 8.6%,
with varying results during each month. Nevertheless, sales at our directly-owned stores were affected
by the lack of traffic, especially in November 2020, during the second confinement period, and since
mid-January 2021, due to new curfew measures. As a consequence, profitability at our directly-owned
stores declined by €0.6 million in the second quarter of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021. The other
segments of our businesses in France showed an overall slight increase, taking into account a decrease
of our discount activities, mainly as a consequence of perimeter reductions and strong performance of
our hearing aid activities, consistent with strong network sales.

On a cumulative basis, Adjusted EBITDA grew by €4.8 million to €42.1 million for the first half of the
fiscal year ending July 31, 2021 versus €37.3 million for the first half of the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020. The franchisor activities at our historical banner generated EBITDA growth, reaching 11.9%, a
consistent level with the network sales increase of 12.7%. Our directly-owned stores also grew overall,
thanks to strong profitability in the first quarter. The EBITDA in our discount banner declined by €0.2
million in the first half of the current fiscal year, versus the same period in the prior year, due to perimeter
reductions in this network. Finally, the hearing aid business reported Adjusted EBITDA of €0.8 million
in the first half of the current fiscal year, thanks to the strong level of network sales.

_Spain_

Adjusted EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) generated in Spain increased by €1.8 million, or 17.1%,
from €10.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €12.1 million for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019. This increase in Adjusted EBITDA mainly resulted from the outperformance of our network,
accompanied, as was the case in France, by a strong recovery at our directly-owned stores structure.

Adjusted EBITDA generated in Spain decreased by €3.8 million, or 31.5%, from €12.1 million for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €8.3 million (pre-IFRS 16; €12.8 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2020. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA (pre-IFRS 16) was attenuated by better
performances of the directly-owned stores, as compared to France.

Adjusted EBITDA in Spain decreased by €0.5 million from €9.1 million in the first half of the prior fiscal
year to €8.6 million for the first half of the current fiscal year. As was the case in the second quarter of
the year ending July 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the fiscal year was affected by
communication phasing, meanwhile our directly-owned stores showed a slight decline of our EBITDA,
due to the COVID-19 pandemic and we experienced a decline in network sales in the second quarter.

_Other countries_

Adjusted EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) generated in the Other countries segment increased by €0.9
million, from €1.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €2.3 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019. In Belgium and in Switzerland, the profitability of our activity increased for the fiscal year,
due to satisfactory performance of our networks, progressively converging with the profitability level at
our Spanish and French networks. In Portugal, we continued to restructure our perimeter, closing down
non-performing stores or underperforming franchisees. As a consequence, our losses continue to
impact the profitability of the Other countries area. Finally, the other geographical areas, while having
a growing footprint are still marginal level in terms of profitability.

Adjusted EBITDA generated in the Other countries segment decreased by €1.7 million, from €2.3 million
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €0.6 million (pre-IFRS 16; €1.0 million post-IFRS 16) for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Belgium accounted for half of the deterioration of our profitability in the
other countries, due to a lower performance of its network up to February 2020, and a slower recovery
after the re-opening of our stores.

Adjusted EBITDA increased by €0.4 million, to €1.7 million for the first half of the current fiscal year, as
compared with €1.3 million for the same period in the prior fiscal year. The strong performance in this
segment was mainly due to the strong recovery of our network sales in Belgium, particularly during the
first quarter.

**Main income statement items**

The main items in our income statement, which are used by management to analyze the consolidated
financial statements, are described below:

**_Revenue_**

Revenue comprises network sales revenue and network purchases revenue, as well as revenue from
direct sales to end customers as part of our directly-owned stores business (see "—Overview" for a

subsidiary. Purchases from suppliers also includes purchases of bought-in goods made by directlyowned stores from suppliers and through our central purchasing units (in which case the purchases are
eliminated on consolidation) that are sold to end customers. We neither operate nor own any
manufacturing facilities. Consequently, our products are manufactured by independent third parties.

rental costs associated with our offices. Other expenses mainly comprise payments for various thirdparty services, such as outsourcing of information systems, temporary workers and different expenses
linked to the operation of stores (such as information technology or energy), management fees paid to
certain shareholders, travel expenses, shipping and telecommunications expenses, and certain
banking services. See "—Factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations—Adoption of

nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as part of our ordinary activities. These items
primarily include: (i) proceeds from disposals of assets; (ii) reversal of, and charges to, exceptional
provisions related to the impairment of assets, such as goodwill, trademarks and business and
leasehold rights; (iii) provisions to cover expenses relating to litigation proceedings and provisions
relating to rental payments on vacant premises; and (iv) costs incurred from the acquisition of new
entities, or any other non-recurring income or expenses, that we present on a separate line to facilitate
the reader's understanding of recurring operating performance and provide him/her with useful
information to identify trends in the Issuer's financial performance.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit represents operating income from ordinary activities, net of other non-recurring
operating items.

**_Net financial income/(expense)_**

**_Net income/(expense) before tax of consolidated companies_**

Net income/(expense) before tax of consolidated companies comprises operating profit and net financial
income/(expense).

**_Tax income/(expense)_**

Tax income/(expense) includes current taxes and deferred taxes. Current taxes corresponds to the
income tax due, which is calculated using the tax rate in effect on the record date, adjusted for income
tax payable in respect of prior years. Tax income/(expense) also includes the corporate value added
tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises, the "CVAE"). It excludes the taxes presented within
other operating income and expenses. The deferred tax amount shows the impact of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities of consolidated companies and their
respective taxable amounts that are used in determining the taxable profit of future periods by applying
the tax rates in effect on the record date.

(1) In the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil discount banner in Spain and the difficulties encountered in
implementing the various components of the franchisor's offer in the store network of the Optimil banner, we decided to initiate the sale of the Optimil banner and
focus on the development of the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain. Negotiations for a potential sale of our subsidiary managing the Optimil banner started in early 2018
and the disposal was completed at the end of October 2018. As a consequence, our discount banner activities in Spain were treated as discontinued operations in
the income statement of our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020. However, the Optimil activities were not
treated as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of cash flows for either period.

**Revenue**

Revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 decreased by €7.3 million, or 1.9%, from €380.3 million
in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €373.0 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, mainly
as a result of a technical change of our wholesale activity for frames, with no impact on profitability. This
is due to a change in the supply chain resulting in a higher proportion of exclusive frames sold directly
by the Group to our franchisees, meanwhile a small proportion of frames within the Tchin Tchin offer
continue to be sold by lenses manufacturers. This change resulted in an apparent decline in the
revenues of our wholesale activity of €10.0 million, mainly in France. Nevertheless, this activity grew
broadly in line with network sales, driven in part by the success of our Magic offer. The Group's revenue
was also marginally affected by lower revenues at our directly-owned stores structure in Spain following
the reduction in its perimeter and lower revenues at our discount activity in France, also due to the
reduction of its perimeter.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the periods
indicated.

-----

**_France_**

Revenue generated in France decreased by €6.6 million, or 2.3%, from €287.4 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2018 to €280.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, mainly due to the technical
impact on revenue recognition of our wholesale activity described above, for an approximate amount of
€10 million. Revenues of our franchisor activities generally evolve consistently with our network, while
the directly-owned stores business grew slightly to €69.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019,
as compared to €68.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, as a result of the strong
performances of our existing directly-owned stores and despite the reduction in its perimeter.

**_Spain_**

Revenue in Spain decreased by €1.9 million, or 2.4%, from €79.3 million for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2018 to €77.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, also due to the same decrease of
directly-owned stores revenue described above of €1.9 million, to €40.3 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019, as compared to €42.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, as a consequence
of the further reduction in perimeter.

**_Other countries_**

Revenue generated by the Other countries segment increased by €1.2 million, from €13.7 million for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €14.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. This change
was mainly attributable to an increase in revenue generated in Belgium, stemming from the launch of a
Belgian central purchasing unit for lenses at the end of 2017, and due generally to strong performances
in Belux and Switzerland, where we have the same range of revenues as in France and Spain.

**Cost of purchases**

The cost of purchases decreased by €10.4 million, or 5.2%, from €201.2 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2018 to €190.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. This evolution mainly related to
the technical changes to the supply chain for our exclusive frames described above, which drove a
significant decline in revenues and purchases. The rest of our cost of purchases increased at a lower
level, in part due to the nature of our franchisor business (royalties and central listing fees do not
generate purchase costs) and due in smaller part to a reduction of purchases at our directly-owned
stores, which showed a gain in gross profit, and at Optical Discount, where the wholesale activity was
reduced.

**Wages and salaries including social security contributions**

Wages and salaries, including social security contributions decreased by €1.6 million, or 2.7%, from
€57.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €55.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019. Our headcount continued to decrease, going from 1,311 employees at July 31, 2018 to 1,284
employees at July 31, 2019, in line with the reduction in our directly-owned stores perimeter, from 170
stores at July 31, 2018 to 162 stores at July 31, 2019. Personnel costs decreased during the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019, due to a reduction of €1.7 million of personnel costs at our directly-owned stores.
This reduction corresponded mainly to the reduction of the perimeter, while in the meantime, sales per
employee grew, due largely to store performance. On the whole, store personnel costs in France and
Spain represented 27.5% at July 31, 2019, as compared to 28.8% at July 31, 2018. In the rest of our
activities, personnel costs increased at a lower rate than the network's activity after changes brought in
the beginning of 2018 (top management, and network management), apart from our digital activity for
which we are progressively building up a new team. More generally, the activity in our main areas
benefitted from overall positive network performance, generating economies of scale especially where
network performance was supported by strong like-for-like performance.

**Other purchases and external expenses**

Other purchases and external expenses were stable at €41.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019 from €41.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. Our expenses benefitted from a
decrease of rental costs, representing €17.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as compared
to €19.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, while other charges increased more slowly than
the network's activity, thanks to our efforts to rationalize expenses.

126


-----

**Duties and taxes other than income tax**

Duties and taxes other than income tax represented an expense of €2.2 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019 from €2.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. This change was mainly linked
to the reduction in the directly-owned stores perimeter.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment represented a net expense of €9.7 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019, €2.7 million below the expense at €12.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2018. Following a reversal of provisions on inventories and receivables on end customers, lower
provisions on our franchisees receivables due to their good performances and reversals linked to the
termination of transactions with certain franchisees, the Group recorded a strong decrease in the net
provision of €1.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. In the meantime, due to the reduction
in our directly-owned stores perimeter, the amortization on tangible assets declined by €1.0 million for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, despite the increase on intangible assets on the franchisor side,
mainly linked to our digital transformation in relation to our IT systems.

**Operating income from ordinary activities**

As a result of the factors discussed above, income from ordinary activities increased by €7.7 million, or
11.7%, from €65.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €73.5 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019.

**Other non-recurring operating items**

Other non-recurring operating items decreased by €4.8 million from €13.5 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2018 to €8.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Over the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019, losses on sales and closures of stores net of the capital gain on the sale of our holding
in Optivisão, represented €1.9 million, as compared to €1.3 million in the fiscal year ended July 31,
2018. Provisions for asset impairment excluding reversal on disposals and closures represented a
charge of €2.1 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as compared to €7.2 million in the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2018, an improvement corresponding to store sales. Provisions on risk and
contingencies, were limited to €0.2 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as compared to €1.3
million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. Lastly, the Group registered other charges for an amount
of €4.5 million, including a cancelled refinancing for €1.9 million, in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019,
as compared to €3.7 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.

**Operating profit**

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating profit increased by €12.6 million, or 24.0%, from
€52.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to €64.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019.

**Net financial income/(expense)**

Net financial expense decreased by €18.5 million, or 25.0%, from €73.9 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2018 to €55.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Borrowing costs generated savings
in cash for an amount of €2.1 million, corresponding to the average interest of our high yield debt that
was refinanced in October 2017. The rest of the difference on our financial charges linked to our
borrowing costs were non-cash, and mainly corresponded to the reduction by €150.0 million of our
convertible bonds, after their conversion in the end of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. Other financial
expense and financial income generated a net charge of €1.6 million in the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019, as compared to an income of €0.5 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, mainly due to a
higher financial charge on foreign exchange linked to purchases of frames denominated in U.S. dollars
and lower net reversal on financial provisions following the achievement of transactions with franchisees
supporting debt towards the Group.

**Net (loss)/income before tax of consolidated companies and tax expense**

As a result of the factors discussed above, the Group generated a net income of €9.4 million for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, from a loss of €21.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.

**Tax income/(expense)**

We recorded a tax expense of €1.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as compared to an
income tax benefit of €16.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The changes in both periods

127


-----

mainly corresponded to the reduction in the rate of the income tax, which impacted our deferred tax
expense with an increased income the year before, meanwhile, over the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019, income tax expenses were stable at €3.6 million, as compared to €3.7 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2018.

**Net income/(loss) from continuing operations**

As a result of the factors discussed above, our result from continuing operations increased by €13.6
million, from a loss of €5.6 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to an income of €8.0 million in
the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

**Net income/(loss) from discontinued operations**

As described above, the Group decided to dispose of its discount activities in Spain, which were
historically managed under the Optimil brand, and completed the disposal of Optimil during the 2019
fiscal year. As a consequence, the Optimil activity was treated separately in discontinued operations
and generated a net loss of €1.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as compared to a loss
of €2.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. The difference mainly comes from the depreciation
in assets.

**Net income/(loss)**

As a result of the factors discussed above, our net income increased by €14.8 million, from a loss of
€8.0 million the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 to an income of €6.8 million the fiscal year ended July
31, 2019.

**Revenue**

Revenue decreased by €63.8 million, or 17.1%, from €373.0 million (for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019) to €309.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, mainly as a result of the pandemic which
strongly impacted network sales in March, April and May 2020. The deficit in Group revenues in the last
quarter was due in large part to the lower level of sales in our directly-owned stores, which
underperformed the rest of our network, due to a higher proportion of such stores being located in
shopping centers and tourist areas, like our flagship store on the Champs Elysées in Paris. For the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2020, the Spanish and French directly-owned stores recorded a decline of sales of
€22.3 million or 20.4% as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 (noting the further reduction
to 151 stores as of July 31, 2020, as compared to 162 stores at July 31, 2019). The evolution of Group
revenues, restated from those directly-owned stores, would represent a total decline of 15.7% at a
comparable level with the total network sales, which declined by 14.8%.

The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by geographic segment for the periods
indicated.

**Total ...........................................................** **373.0** **309.2** **309.2** **(63.8)** **(17.1)%**

**_France_**

Group revenue in France declined €47.8 million, or 17.0%, from €280.8 million in the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019 to €232.9 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, due to the significant impact of
COVID-19 and the network reduction on our directly-owned stores sales.

**_Spain_**

Group revenue in Spain decreased by €13.1 million, or 16.9%, from €77.4 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019 to €64.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, due to the significant impact
of COVID-19 and perimeter reductions in our directly-owned stores network, as well as resulting from
a slightly slower recovery than in France.

**_Other countries_**

Revenue generated by the Other countries segment decreased by €2.8 million, or 18.9%, from €14.8
million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €12.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.
The primary reason for the decrease is the COVID-19 pandemic, with lower sales at our five directlyowned stores in Portugal, and a slower recovery in our Belgium network, which represents almost half
of our network sales in the Other countries segment.

**Cost of purchases**

Cost of purchases decreased by €30.1 million, or 15.8%, from €190.7 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019 to €160.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. This evolution mainly related to
COVID-19, with an impact consistent with than on network sales and Group revenues, with particular
impacts felt at our directly-owned stores.

**Wages and salaries including social security contributions**

Wages and salaries, including social security contributions decreased by €1.7 million, or 3.1%, from
€55.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €54.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020. Our headcount continued to decrease from 1,284 employees at July 31, 2019 to 1,215 employees
at July 31, 2020, in line with the reduction in our directly-owned stores perimeter, from 162 stores at
July 31, 2019 to 151 at July 31, 2020. Personnel costs at our directly-owned stores in France and Spain
decreased during the fiscal year, with a reduction of €3.8 million, corresponding on one hand to the
temporary lay-off procedures put in place for an approximate amount of €2 million, and on the other
hand, mainly relating to perimeter reductions. The temporary layoff measures had their main impact
during the third quarter of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020; as a consequence, during the last quarter

129


-----

of our fiscal year, our personnel costs increased, mainly corresponding to the increase of our teams in
the franchise business and digital transformation business areas.

**Other purchases and external expenses**

Other purchases and external expenses (pre-IFRS 16) decreased to €39.3 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2020 from €41.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Our expenses benefitted
from a decrease of rental costs, mainly due to the perimeter reduction of our directly-owned stores;
negotiations with landlords around the initial confinement period had a very limited impact on rental
costs (€1.0 million). Other purchases and external expenses (post-IFRS 16) amounted to €24.4 million.
The total charge of rental costs represented €16.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, as
compared to €17.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, of which €15.0 million was reclassified
in depreciation on right of use assets and the rest as finance charges on leases.

**Duties and taxes other than income tax**

Duties and taxes other than income tax represented an expense of €2.3 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020, as compared to €2.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment (pre-IFRS 16) represented a net expense of €5.2 million
(€17.9 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, €4.5 million below a net expense
of €9.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the Group
registered €4.2 million of net reversal of provisions, mainly on inventories and franchisees receivables,
after the termination of transactions with certain former franchisees, as compared to a net provision of
€1.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. On the other hand, the depreciation and amortization
of our fixed assets grew by €1.4 million (pre-IFRS 16), following our digital transformation plan,
meanwhile this flow slightly decreased at our directly-owned stores, due to the reduction of its perimeter.

**Operating income from ordinary activities**

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income from ordinary activities (pre-IFRS 16)
decreased by €25.8 million, or 35.1%, from €73.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to
€47.7 million (€49.9 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.

**Other non-recurring operating items**

Other non-recurring operating items expense decreased by €6.9 million, from €8.7 million for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2019 to €1.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. For the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2020, sales and closures of stores represented an income of €0.3 million, as compared
to a charge of €1.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Provisions for asset impairment
excluding reversal on disposals and closures represented a charge of €1.3 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2020, as compared to €2.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as a result of
the reduction of the perimeter and the improvement of store sales (excluding the COVID-19 impact)
and a depreciation on _Malentille.com_ of €0.5 million, as compared to the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019. Provisions on risk and contingencies, were limited to €0.1 million for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2020, as compared to €0.2 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Lastly, the other charges
represented an amount of €0.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, including a gift of masks
to the health authorities for €0.4 million, as compared to €4.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2019, including a cancelled refinancing for €1.9 million.

**Operating profit**

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating profit (pre-IFRS 16) decreased by €19.0 million,
or 29.3%, from €64.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to €45.9 million (€48.1 million postIFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.

**Net financial income/(expense)**

Net financial expense (pre-IFRS 16) decreased by €0.4 million from €55.4 million for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2019 to €55.0 million (€57.8 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31,
2020, the difference corresponding to the finance charge on leases. Borrowing costs (pre-IFRS 16)
generated grew by €0.2 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Non-cash interest charge on our
convertible bonds declined by €0.5 million, thanks to the early redemption of €52.0 million in the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2019, as well as by €0.3 million following the redemption of €10.0 million of Existing
Floating Rate Notes in June 2019. On the other hand, higher interest charges linked to the drawdown

130


-----

of the Existing Revolving Credit Facility for four months and charges linked to the write off of historical
debt towards franchisees, resulted in a slight increase of borrowing costs. Investment income and other
financial expense generated savings of €0.6 million, corresponding mainly to a net reversal of provisions
on franchisees, and a lower financial charge on foreign exchange linked to purchases of frames
denominated in U.S. dollars (more favorable exchange rate of the euro versus dollar).

**Net income/(expense) before tax of consolidated companies and tax expense**

As a result of the factors described above, the Group generated a loss (pre-IFRS 16) of €9.1 million
(loss of €9.6 million post-IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, from an income of €9.4 million
in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

**Tax income/(expense)**

We recorded an income tax expense of €1.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 (pre-IFRS
16), as compared to an expense of €1.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Over the fiscal
year, income tax expenses decreased as a consequence of the decrease in our overall performance.

**Net income/(loss) from continuing operations**

As a result of the factors discussed above, our result from continuing operations decreased by €18.3
million, from an income of €8.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to a loss of €10.3 million
for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.

**Net income/(loss) from discontinued operations**

As described above, the Group made the decision to dispose of its discount activities in Spain, which
were historically managed under the Optimil brand, and completed the disposal of Optimil during the
2019 fiscal year. As a consequence, the Optimil activity represented an income of €0.1 million for the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 (corresponding to the final agreement on Optimil's disposal), as
compared to a loss of €1.2 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019.

**Net income/(loss)**

As a result of the factors discussed above, our net income decreased by €16.9 million, from an income
of €6.8 million the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to a loss of €10.1 million for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020 (pre-IFRS 16).

France ............................................................................................... 127.5 140.3 _12.8_ _10.1%_

**Total ..................................................................................................** **172.3** **184.5** _12.1_ _7.0%_

Revenue increased to €184.5 million, or 7.0%, in the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021 from
€172.3 million in the first half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. This increase primarily occurred in
the first three months of the period. In the second three months of the period, there was only a slight
increase of Group revenue as compared to a network sales increase of 6.4% in the second quarter of
the current fiscal year, is mainly due to the decrease of directly-owned store sales mainly in France and
Spain, as a result of the confinement measures affecting a broad part of this perimeter. We recorded
overall revenue growth of 11.3% excluding our directly-owned stores businesses in France and Spain.

**_France_**

Revenue generated in France increased from €127.5 million to €140.3 million in the first half of the
current fiscal year. This increase was primarily in the first three months of the period (with the second
three months in the period experiencing only a slight increase) and stemmed from strong network
performance, while directly-owned store sales declined by €0.7 million, as a consequence of the second
confinement in late autumn 2020 and curfew measures implemented since mid-January 2021. The
decrease in revenue in our directly-owned stores is mainly due to the proportion of stores located in
large shopping centers or stores like at Champs Elysées that have been historically supported by high
levels of traffic, which has been lacking since the start of the pandemic. Further, revenues at our hearing
aid activities were €0.5 million lower than the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, due to the phasing of
our communication. In the first half of the fiscal year, revenues increased by 10.1% versus the year
before, at a closer level to the overall increase in network performance of 12.7%, mainly thanks to the

132


-----

better performance of our directly-owned stores during the first quarter and an overall alignment of other
businesses with the network improvement.

**_Spain_**

Revenue in Spain decreased by €1.3 million, from €37.9 million in the first half of the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020 to €36.6 million in the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021. As in France, our
directly-owned stores registered a sales decline of €0.6 million during the second quarter of the fiscal
year ending July 31, 2021, stemming from confinement measures taken during late autumn 2020, which
significantly impacted stores located in shopping centers and tourist areas, as well as a specific episode
of heavy snowfall during mid-January 2021 in the Madrid region. Finally, as is the case in our hearing
aid business in France, communication revenues (which include hearing aid devices) were lower than
the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, due to the phasing of our communication, with a cumulative
negative difference of €1.0 million on the first half of the current fiscal year.

**_Other countries_**

Revenue generated by the Other countries segment increased by €0.7 million to €7.6 million for the first
half of the year ending July 31, 2021 as compared to €7.0 million for the first half of the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2020, with the increase being primarily the result of activity in the first three months of the period.
The increase was driven by network sales growth of 2.7% during the quarter, combined with stronger
revenues in Belgium. which showed resilient sales performance during the quarter, and more attenuated
performances at our Portuguese owned stores, due in part to rapid spread of the pandemic since
November 2020

**Cost of purchases**

Cost of purchases for the first half of the current fiscal year grew by €8.3 million, or 9.8%, to €92.3
million, as compared to €84.0 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year, at a comparable level
with the evolution of network sales.

**Wages and salaries including social security contributions**

Wages and salaries including social security contributions increased by 2.6% from €28.5 million in the
first half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020 to €29.3 million in the first half of the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2021. The increase included €0.9 million of personnel charges which are linked to provisions
on bonuses which will be paid to the managers only at exit of the controlling shareholders, but which
was recorded in the second three months of the period. On the whole, our personnel costs excluding
exit bonuses were stable during the first half of the current fiscal year, despite a total growth of network
sales of 10.5%.

**Other purchases and external expenses**

Other purchases and external expenses have decreased to €11.2 million for the first half of the current
fiscal year, as compared with €11.9 million for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The decrease
was €0.1 million for the second quarter of the period as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal
year, notably due to lower expenses linked to the management of our network, including travel
expenses. As was the case during the second quarter, the improvement of other purchases and external
expenses during the first half of the current fiscal year was mainly linked to lower expenses as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Duties and taxes other than income tax**

Duties and taxes other than income tax increased slightly during the first half of the current fiscal year
to an expense of €1.2 million, as compared with €1.1 million in the same period in the prior fiscal year.

**Depreciation, amortization and impairment**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment represented an expense of €10.8 million for the first half of
the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021 as compared with an expense of €10.4 million for the same half of
the prior fiscal year. Amortization of assets grew by €1.1 million during the first half of the fiscal year,
mainly as a consequence of our digital transformation plan, while depreciation of assets in our directlyowned stores were almost stable during the first half of the current fiscal year, versus the same period a
year before. On the other hand, during the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, we registered
a net reversal of provisions of €0.9 million compared to a net reversal of provisions of €0.2 million in the
same period the year before. These reversals of provisions mainly correspond to an increase of €0.9
million on net reversals of provisions on franchisees' debt in France for the first half of this fiscal year,

133


-----

thanks to the improvement of the risk on those franchisees (debt reduction and refinancing by those
franchisees).

**Operating income from ordinary activities**

As a result of the factors discussed above, income from ordinary activities grew by €3.4 million, to €39.8
million in the first half of the current fiscal year from €36.4 million in the same period of the prior fiscal
year, despite a decrease in the second quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year.

**Other non-recurring operating items**

Other non-recurring operating items represented a loss of €3.0 million for the first half of the current
fiscal year as compared to an income of €0.1 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. In addition
to the charges related to the termination of the agreement with the former CEO during the second quarter
of the current fiscal year and charges on goodwill at our directly-owned stores, we recorded a loss mainly
linked to the closure of a directly-owned store of €0.6 million for the first quarter of the fiscal year ending
July 31, 2021, versus a net income of €0.6 million in the same period of the prior year.

**Operating profit**

As a result of the factors discussed above, operating profit increased by €0.2 million to €36.8 million in
the first half of the current fiscal year from €36.5 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year, despite
a decrease in the second quarter compared to the same quarter in the prior year.

**Net financial income/(expense)**

During the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, net financial expense increased to €32.1
million versus €28.7 million in the same period a year before, mainly as a consequence of the increase
of €3.0 million in non-cash interest charges on the Shareholder Bonds and a loss on a financial debt of
a former franchisee, which was fully provisioned.

**Net income/(expense) before tax of consolidated companies**

Net income before tax of consolidated companies decreased to a net income of €4.6 million for the first
half of the current fiscal year as compared with a net income of €7.8 million for the same period of the
prior fiscal year.

**Tax income/(expense)**

We recorded a tax expense of €2.4 million in the first half of the current fiscal year, as compared with
tax expense of €2.1 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year, reflecting a slight decrease in
income tax expense, which was more than offset by deferred tax charges generated during the period
(as compared to deferred tax income generated in the same period in the prior fiscal year).

**Net income/(loss) from continuing operations**

As a result of the factors discussed above, our net income from continuing operations decreased to
€2.2 million for the first half of the current fiscal year, as compared to €5.7 million in the same period in
the prior fiscal year, due to a slight loss in the second quarter.

**Net income/(loss) from discontinued operations**

In the first half of the current fiscal year, net income from discontinued operations amounted to €0.4
million, corresponding to the final agreement on Optimil's disposal, versus nil in the same period the year
before.

**Net income/(loss)**

As a result of the factors discussed above, we recorded an income of €2.6 million for the first half of
the year ending July 31, 2021, as compared to an income of €5.8 million in the same period of the
previous fiscal year, due to a slight net loss in the second quarter.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Historically, our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from the need to service our indebtedness,
finance working capital, fund the expansion of our store network, finance acquisitions and pay taxes.

Prior to the Offering, our sources of liquidity have historically consisted mainly of the following:

134


-----

    - issuances of debt consisting of prior issuances of high yield notes and borrowings under
the Existing Revolving Credit Facility and the PGE;

    - shareholder injections in the form of the Shareholder Bonds;

    - certain other bilateral credit facilities permitted sales of discounted receivables from
franchisees (cessions Dailly), finance leases and factoring of CICE- and CIR-related
receivables; and

    - cash generated from operating activities.

Following the Offering, our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operating activities and
the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Group's franchise/asset-light model generates strong levels of
operating cash flows, with only limited working capital and capital expenditure requirements. The
majority of our indebtedness will be represented by the Notes offered hereby and, at the Issuer-level,
the Shareholder Bonds. Additionally, we will continue to access certain uncommitted short-term
discount lines (assignment of trade receivables), overdrafts, medium-term bilateral loans and financial
leases as business needs dictate, in particular for store renovations (mainly for directly-owned stores)
and key money. Finally, the Group will maintain a network of directly-owned stores and will
consequently have lease arrangements on its owned stores and certain administrative premises,
representing total right of use assets under IFRS 16 of €64.1 million, and lease debt, net of sublease
arrangements, of €67.7 million as of January 31, 2021. See "Capitalization" and "Description of Certain
_Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements"._

The sources of our working capital requirements include:

    - requirements relating to sales of goods in our wholesale activity with our networks. In
connection with our exclusive frames trading business and central purchasing unit sales,
we recognize significant trade receivables in relation to our franchisees as well as in relation
to our partners distributing the exclusive frames. The redistribution of the frames to
franchisees via the logistics platform in Hong Kong ties up significant funds, given the
quantities stored locally in order to efficiently serve all networks. This creates a substantial
trade receivable with respect to said supplier in light of the volumes required to ensure that
goods are redistributed to franchisees without the risk of stock outs. Furthermore, optical
sales to end-consumers via directly-owned stores in France generate customer credit for
an estimated period of between 15 days and one month following the sale, due to the thirdparty payment system that is used in the French optical sector (tiers payant);

    - inventories, mainly in directly-owned stores. Inventories may vary depending on the arrival
of new collections, particularly with regard to sunglasses. We also store products to be sold
to franchisees as part of the rollout of new collections; and

    - requirements generated by central listing and payment unit arrangements, whereby we pay
suppliers on behalf of franchisees. Such mechanisms normally generate a time lag of 15
days to 1 month between payment to suppliers and payment by franchisees in respect of
the goods concerned. In addition, in the event of late payments, we sometimes grant
franchised stores more flexible payment deadlines, which further increases working capital
requirements.

€0.4 million change in working capital requirements and income tax paid of €3.6 million.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, net cash from operating activities amounted to €86.2 million.
This reflected cash flow before borrowing costs of €74.5 million, slightly above the previous fiscal year,
partially offset by a higher change in working capital requirements at €16.5 million and income tax paid
of €4.8 million.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, net cash from operating activities amounted to €58.8 million on

In the six months ended January 31, 2021, net cash from operating activities amounted to €68.1 million.
This reflected cash flow before borrowing costs of €48.2 million, an increase from the six months ended
January 31, 2020, along with increased change in working capital requirements at €21.2 million and
income tax paid of €1.3 million.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, cash flow before borrowing costs amounted to €73.4 million,
compared to €66.7 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. Cash flow before borrowing costs, as
compared to operating performance as measured at the Adjusted EBITDA level amounting to €79.0
million, was mainly impacted by the recurring monitoring fees to our shareholders for €1.1 million, and
a few exceptional items (including the Optimil operating loss), which accounted for €0.9 million and
other exceptional expenses mainly related to the financial structure of the Group.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, cash flow before borrowing costs amounted to €74.5 million, as
compared to €73.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. Cash flow before borrowing costs, as
compared with operating performance as measured at the EBITDA level amounting to €83.8 million,
was mainly impacted by recurring monitoring fees paid to our shareholders in amount of €1.1 million
and certain exceptional items, of which the Optimil operating loss accounted for €0.7 million and other
exceptional expenses mainly linked to a transaction relating to the Group's financial structure which
was ultimately abandoned.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, cash flow before borrowing costs amounted to €50.7 million
(€65.7 million post-IFRS 16), as compared to €74.5 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. Cash
flow before borrowing costs, as compared with operating performance as measured at the EBITDA
level amounting to €55.6 million, was mainly impacted by management exit bonuses and monitoring
fees for €2.5 million, other financial charges for €1.2 million and certain other exceptional items.

In the six months ended January 31, 2021, cash flow before borrowing costs amounted to €48.2 million,
compared to €45.9 million for the same period in the prior year. Cash flow before borrowing costs grew
by €2.3 million compared to an increase in Adjusted EBITDA of €4.7 million, for the same period in the
prior year. The difference mainly comes from management exit bonuses, and the impact of the
departure of our former CEO in the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021.

_Change in working capital requirements_

The following table sets out changes in working capital requirements in the fiscal years ended July 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020 and during the six months ended January 31, 2020 and 2021.

**Change in working capital requirements .......** **(0.4)** **16.5** **(2.7)** **(2.7)** **(0.2)** **21.2**

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, change in working capital requirements was substantially stable,
with a positive cash flow of €0.4 million. This was mainly attributable to:

    - lower accounts receivable, linked to network sales performance which resulted in better
payment regularity of our franchisees; thus, the growth of our activity did not generate
further large working capital requirements; and

    - inventories have been slightly reduced, partly because of the reduction in our directlyowned stores network.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, change in working capital generated a strong positive flow of
€16.5 million, due to several factors:

    - The main factor was the change in the supply of our exclusive frames for franchisees, part
of which is now directly managed by our wholesale business, which represented a decline
in receivables on exclusive products of €9.0 million. This was partially offset by the impact
of the reduction of our directly-owned stores structure.

    - Receivables at our franchisees decreased thanks to the improvement in the payment
regularity of our franchisees.

    - The reduction in the directly-owned stores perimeter and better management in our owned
stores generated a further decrease in our receivables with end customers, through private
health insurers.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, change in working capital generated an outflow of €2.7 million
(as compared to an inflow of €16.5 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019):

    - The main factor in this change was the support provided to our franchisees during the first
COVID-19 confinement period. As of July 31, 2020, €25.7 million was outstanding in
connection with grants to franchisees.

    - In the context of COVID-19, the French Government authorized companies to delay certain
social charges payments, which represented an amount of €1.5 million at the end of the
fiscal year ended July 31, 2020.

    - Due to pending discussions around temporary rents during the confinement period, certain
payments due to our landlords remained open, for an amount of €1.7 million as of July 31,
2020.

In the first half of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021, changes in working capital requirements
amounted to a cash inflow of €21.2 million, compared to a cash outflow of €0.2 million in the same
period the year before. As was the case in the first half of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, inventories
grew by €1.2 million, due to the increase of inventories of exclusive frames and sunglasses before the
Lunar New Year in China, and larger amounts of inventories kept at our directly-owned stores. The
main impact on our working capital requirements stems from a reduction in our receivables, with the
repayment €13.1 million of the support given to our franchisees during the first confinement in spring
2020, from a position of €25.7 million at the end of the past fiscal year. Also, due to strong sales in our

138


-----

network, our franchisees were able to repay other debt, for an overall amount of €1 million. Finally,
receivables decreased as of January 31, 2021, as a consequence of the high position at July 31, 2020,
following the strong rebound of sales in June and July 2020. On the other hand, our trade payables
were maintained at a high level, due to the phasing of our communication. Lastly, trade payables
recorded €2.7 million of suspended payments (mainly on rents, as part of discussions with real estate
companies for our shopping center premises) as compared to €1.7 million of payments delayed as of
July 31, 2020.

_Income tax paid_

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, income tax paid amounted to €3.6 million.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, income tax paid amounted to €4.8 million.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, income tax paid amounted to €4.3 million.

In the first half of the year ending July 31, 2021, income tax paid was €1.3 million, as compared with
€2.9 million in the same period of the prior fiscal year. The difference is mainly due to a regularization
of an excess payment on income tax paid the year before at our Swiss branch.

€5.4 million for the debt issuance costs and interest charges on the Existing Notes and (iv) payment of
cash interest. The cash interest payment corresponds to accrued interest at the time of repayment in
October 2017 of our previous series of notes, plus interest paid quarterly on the Existing Notes (quarterly
payments for the €175 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Floating Rate Notes, and semiannual payments for the €250 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Fixed Rate Notes).

€10.7 million (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis; an outflow of €8.4 million on a post-IFRS 16 basis). It included
the following key items:

    - new debt in an amount of €30.1 million, mainly corresponding to the government-backed
loan Prêt Garanti par l'Etat for €30 million, which was drawn in mid-July 2020 for a period
of one year and which is renewable for up to five years;

stores bought back from franchisees and repayment of loans (post-IFRS 16), for a total
amount of €16.2 million including the repayment of right of use assets under IFRS 16, for
a cumulative amount of €15.5 million, including sub-lease agreements; and

    - interest paid of €18.7 million (pre-IFRS 16), of which €16.9 million was for servicing the

the six months ended January 31, 2021 as compared to July 31, 2020.

As of the Issue Date, the Issuer's assets will consist largely of its direct and indirect interest in the share
capital of 3ABOD, the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan and the Alain Afflelou Franchiseur
Proceeds Loan and its liabilities will be limited to the Notes, guarantees under the Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement and the Shareholder Bonds, the last of which, by their terms, will be expressly
subordinated to the Notes. The Issuer will not have any material off-balance sheet commitments, other
contingent liabilities or contractual commitments.

Secured loans are part of our overall borrowing capacity. For such operations, we are involved in these
transactions in our capacity as guarantor to these banks for the financing they provide to franchisees in
the proportion of 100% of each application for financing, with a maximum exposure of up to
approximately 30% of a contractually-agreed cap for each facility.

In addition, we also engage in opportunistic factoring transactions with factoring providers on a recourse
basis pursuant to which receivables due from franchisees are sold at a discount to such factoring
providers. We also engage in opportunistic factoring transactions with factoring providers on a nonrecourse basis pursuant to which receivables due from the French state related to CIR tax credits are
sold. These transactions are made pursuant to one-off factoring transactions entered into when
management determines it can improve our net working capital.

We have access to uncommitted discount receivables lines (cessions Dailly) for an amount of
approximately €35 million, with a group of commercial banks. These lines give us capacity to borrow
against receivables from franchisees that mature at a maximum of 45 days and are on a recourse basis.
These lines are generally used for working capital purposes for short periods, generally for intra-month
requirements. In the six-month period ended January 31, 2021, we did not utilize these lines. See
"Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—Assignment of accounts
_receivable"._

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK**

**Exchange rate risk**

Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
We face foreign exchange risks to the extent that most of our revenue is in euros while we source most
of our frames and sunglasses from a Chinese intermediary agent, as discussed above, on the basis of
a price list denominated in U.S. dollars. Although our current arrangements with our Chinese
intermediary agent use a fixed exchange rate between euros and U.S. dollars for certain purchases,
this rate could change or cease to be fixed, in which case a sustained appreciation of the U.S. dollar
against the euro may lead to an increase in prices we pay for products that we may not necessarily be
able to pass on, whether partially or entirely, to our franchisees or end customers. In addition, our
network works with suppliers who, although their merchandise is billed in euros, are themselves subject
to fluctuations in exchange rates, in particular between euros and U.S. dollars.

**Interest rate risk**

We are exposed to interest rate fluctuations as certain of our indebtedness bears interest rates at
floating rates that could increase, increasing our debt service obligations. Borrowings under the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest indexed to the Euro
Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR"), adjusted periodically, plus a margin for drawings in euro, may
increase significantly in the future, resulting in additional interest expense for us, reducing the free cash
flow for investments and limiting our ability to service our indebtedness. Although we do not currently
intend to enter into hedging derivatives with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, we may do so
in the future. As of January 31, 2021, our outstanding floating-rate third-party debt was €165.0 million
relating to the Existing Floating Rate Notes and our outstanding fixed-rate third-party debt was
€250.0 million relating to the Existing Fixed Rate Notes.

**Liquidity risk**

The Issuer's financial liabilities mainly include borrowings and trade and other debts. These liabilities
may expose us to liquidity risk in the event of early repayment or short maturity. In order to manage our
liquidity risk, we rely on cash on hand and additionally contracts revolving credit or bank facilities for an
appropriate amount and maturity to ensure that we have adequate available funds to meet our
commitments with a large range of financial institutions. We had cash and cash equivalents of €117.4
million as of January 31, 2021 and €76.9 million as of July 31, 2020, respectively, compared to €35.7
million as of January 31, 2019 and €37.6 million as of January 31, 2018. The Existing Revolving Credit
Facility was undrawn as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, January 31, 2021 and July 31, 2018,
2019 and 2020.

**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES**

The discussion and analysis of the Issuer's financial condition and results of operations are based upon
the Issuer's consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with IFRS as of the
date of preparation of the financial statements, including the International Accounting Standards ("IAS")
and IFRS standards and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC")
interpretations. The preparation of this financial information requires us to make estimates and
judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and
judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on

143


-----

the Issuer's financial information, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Due to the
uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying
the critical accounting policies described below. For more information, see note 4.3 to the Issuer's
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**Goodwill impairment testing**

Goodwill and intangible assets (including trademarks) arise in connection with acquisitions. We do not
amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets' respective useful lives. Goodwill is tested for
impairment at least annually, at year end, using the method described in the notes to the Issuer's
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The outcome of
such an assessment is subjective, and the result sensitive to the assumed future cash flows to be
generated by the cash-generating units or assets and discount rates applied in calculating the value in
use. Any impairment arising is charged to the income statement.

**Retirement benefits**

We offer our employees retirement plans and other long-term benefits in accordance with regulations
and market practices in France and Spain. We account for our defined benefit plans in accordance with
IAS 19 "Employee benefits". Accounting for retirement benefit plans requires us to make assumptions
including, but not limited to, discount rates, rates of inflation and life expectancies. The use of different
assumptions could have a material effect on the accounting values of the relevant assets and liabilities
which could result in a material change to the cost of such liabilities as recognized in the income
statement over time. These assumptions are subject to periodic review.

**Deferred taxes**

Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is regarded as probable that the deductible
temporary differences can be realized. The probability that we are able to realize such differences is
based on fiscal forecasts drawn up for the tax consolidation group. We estimate deferred tax assets as
well as expectations regarding the manner and timing of recovery of the related assets. Changes in
these estimates may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets.

**Provisions**

We record provisions for liabilities when we have a current obligation (legal or implied) resulting from a
past event; it is likely that an outflow of resources representative of economic benefits will be necessary
in order to clear the obligation; and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. The
provisions are determined and updated based on assumptions made by us at each reporting date.
When the impact is significant, we discount provisions based on a discount rate that reflects the riskfree interest rate and the risks specific to the asset. Due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters,
actual results could differ from the estimates on which these provisions are based.

**Advertising expenses**

Communication fees collected from stores in our network on a monthly basis are recognized as revenue
generated by such fees when advertising expenses or communication fees are effectively incurred, for
instance in connection with the launch of an advertising campaign.

**Inventories**

Valuation of inventories requires the exercise of judgement, particularly with regard to impairment, as
prospective inventory turnover rates are used in such valuation.

**IFRS 16**

The application of IFRS 16 requires the exercise of judgement, particularly with regard to:

  - the definition of a lease;

  - the determination of the lease term, which takes into account the exercise of termination or
renewal options when the Group is reasonably certain of exercising them; and

  - the determination of the incremental borrowing rate, which is calculated by taking into account
residual lease terms on the date of first application.

**The optical products market**

**_Overview of optical products_**

The term "optical products" refers to products used for vision enhancement and protection or as fashion
items, which include, among other things, corrective lenses, frames, contact lenses, sunglasses and
related products (primarily care products for contact lenses and accessories, such as cases, cords and
chains). In general, optical products are either healthcare-related prescription products that are
designed to address vision impairment, such as prescription glasses and contact lenses, or nonprescription products, such as non-prescription sunglasses or ready readers.

_Prescription optical products_

Prescription optical products are non-discretionary healthcare products that include corrective lenses,
frames and contact lenses. Functionality, comfort and aesthetics are the key factors that influence
customers when selecting prescription optical products. An individual's need for prescription optical
products is assessed through eye examinations and tests. In many countries, optometrists and opticians
perform eye examinations, administer eye tests and prescribe prescription optical products. In France,
only ophthalmologists are authorized to prescribe prescription optical products, although such
prescription are valid for up to five years. Additionally, the 100% Santé changes authorize opticians to
perform view exams which are be reimbursable by French public health insurance, effectively
repositioning opticians as health professionals. Opticians are now allowed to perform such view exams
and adapt ophthalmologist prescriptions (unless barred by the ophthalmologist, in contrast to the past
where the ophthalmologist would have to specify authorization for repurchase without a new
prescription). Such prescriptions are valid for five years for people aged from 16 to 42 years old and
three years for people over 42 years old. This capacity to change glasses with a prescription that is up
to five years old without visiting an ophthalmologist is a measure that is intended to help address the
shortage of ophthalmologists in France. At present, only a limited proportion of people (around 15% to
20%, as measured by _Observatoire de l'Optique-Xerfi)_ are taking advantage of this flexibility of not
being required to have a new prescription to buy glasses, as compared to 10% to 15% in 2015. For
further information concerning the regulations governing the optical products and hearing aid market in
France and Spain, see "Regulation—France—Regulations governing the optical products and hearing

145


-----

_aid markets in France" and "Regulation—Spain—Regulations governing the optical products and_
_hearing aid markets in Spain"._

_Corrective lenses_

There are different types of corrective lenses: (i) unifocal lenses with one correction region correcting a
particular vision condition and (ii) multifocal lenses (including bifocals and progressive lenses) with two
or three correction regions, each dealing with a particular vision condition. Progressive lenses are
generally used by people over 40 years old, who have presbyopia. The market for corrective lenses
has evolved considerably in the more than 45 years since our founding, as exemplified by the
emergence of tailor-made progressive lenses and lenses produced with the help of digital surfacing
technology. Essilor-Luxottica, Carl Zeiss Vision and Hoya are the leaders in the market for corrective
lenses.

_Frames_

Frames are generally available in a wide range of materials, styles and brands, generally need to be
adapted to suit their wearer and may also have additional technical features, such as flexible spring
hinges. Many customers consider glasses to be fashion accessories in addition to having a functional
purpose, so aesthetics and the brand name represent key factors in customers' decision to purchase
frames. The market for frame manufacturing, which consists of a large number of medium-sized players,
is highly fragmented and competitive. However, two groups, Essilor-Luxottica and Safilo, are considered
the leaders in this market, in particular for luxury brands.

_Contact lenses and care solutions_

As is the case with corrective lenses, contact lenses may be unifocal or multifocal. Further, contact
lenses can be soft, rigid or hybrid, which share qualities with both soft and rigid lenses. Rigid contact
lenses are generally more expensive than soft contact lenses because they may be used for several
years without replacement. Contact lenses also require certain care products, such as daily or weekly
cleaning solutions. Contact lenses are not perfect substitutes for traditional optical products but present
customers with an alternative to wearing glasses. Consequently, customers who wear contact lenses
typically also own at least one pair of glasses to regularly or occasionally replace their contact lenses.
As such, even if wearing contact lenses would generally require a prescription from an ophthalmologist,
we view contact lenses and contact care solutions as discretionary sales, as compared to corrective
glasses (frames plus corrective lenses), which we consider to be largely non-discretionary. This
segment is also dependent on other retail channels, like e-commerce and pharmacies. As a
consequence, the evolution of this channel in 2020, as measured by GfK, was not as strong as
corrective glasses (-11% for contact lenses versus -7% for corrective glasses in the French market, and
-18% for contact lenses versus -13% for corrective glasses in the Spanish market). The market for the
manufacturing of contact lenses is led by three U.S. manufacturers (Johnson & Johnson, Bausch &
Lomb and Coopervision) and one Swiss manufacturer (Alcon-Ciba).

_Non-prescription optical products_

Non-prescription products include ready readers, non-prescription sunglasses, protective eyewear for
use during certain activities or sports, accessories, such as cases, cords and chains and cosmetic
contact lenses and binoculars. Sunglasses, which are generally the largest segment of the nonprescription optical products market, are both a protective product and a fashion product, which is why
they enjoy particularly high market penetration. As such, those products can be sold through various
channels, including department stores, clothing and fashion stores and grocery stores, as well as
generalist and pure-play e-commerce websites.

**_General optical products market drivers_**

Our main geographic markets are France and Spain and we also have presence in, among other
countries, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland. The drivers of the optical products market
are broadly consistent across our geographic markets: consumption trends and demographics, social
drivers and macroeconomics, the regulatory environment and technological advances.

_Consumption trends and demographics_

One of the primary drivers of the optical products market is the increased prevalence of vision
conditions, mainly due to an aging population. Purchases of prescription optical products that address
such vision conditions are generally non-discretionary. Prescription optical products are also more
resilient during periods when purchases diminish, in particular in France where a significant portion of

146


-----

the cost of optical products is reimbursed by private health insurers through supplementary health
insurance contracts. Further, the repurchase and replacement cycle for optical products is typically two
to four years and is relatively steady, as replacement ultimately depends on general wear and tear or
loss of glasses as well as on periodic adjustments to the patient's correction strength due to changes
in their vision.

In France and Spain, average selling prices ("ASPs") for optical products are influenced by a number
of trends. On one hand, promotions and rebates, along with the rise of low-price products marketed by
large retailers, generally tend to lower ASPs, a trend that has also been driven by the French regulatory
environment and the rise of closed networks in France. On the other hand, product mix tends to drive
higher ASPs. For example, growing demand for multifocal lenses is apparent in the principal countries
in which we operate. Multifocal lenses generally have higher ASPs than unifocal lenses. For instance,
in France, the proportion (in terms of volume) of lenses sold that were multifocals grew to 38.7% in
2019, as compared to 31.8% in 2012. In 2020 in France, a pair of monofocal glasses cost consumers
on average €304 and a pair of multifocal glasses cost consumers on average €551 (according to a
Gallileo survey). The higher ASPs commanded by multifocals, combined with increased volumes across
optical product segments, helped to partially offset the impact of the above-mentioned decline in ASPs.
Only non-prescription sunglasses have experienced price growth (with flat volumes) in recent years.

The hearing aid market operates similarly, with increasing volumes tied to an aging population, partially
offsetting the impact of declining prices. For example, in the French hearing aid market, volumes grew
at a CAGR of 7.1% over the 2015 to 2020 period. This growth in volume is due to accelerate in coming
years, as a result of the entry into force of 100% Santé, which has enabled people to get hearing devices
for free, beginning in January 2021.

_Population growth and aging_

Current demographic studies indicate a growing and aging population in our primary markets. Between
2019 and 2024, the population in France is expected to grow by approximately 1.0 million and remain
stable in Spain. Usually, eyesight begins deteriorating progressively between ages 40 and 45 and the
occurrence of visual disorders, particularly presbyopia, generally becomes more common and more
serious with age. It is estimated that, by 2025, 46.7% of the French population and 52.7% of the Spanish
population will be over age 45 and that 56%% and 53% of the French and Spanish populations will
wear prescription glasses (versus respectively 54% and 52% in 2020, and 51% and 48% in 2012).

_Healthcare-related, non-discretionary nature of prescription optical products purchases_

The prescription optical products market generally tracks GDP, though in France it is more insulated
from swings in GDP due to the favorable French insurance and reimbursement frameworks.
Additionally, purchases of prescription optical products are generally non-discretionary: while the
purchase of glasses or contact lenses may be temporarily deferred or a less expensive product may be
selected, customers generally do not decide against vision correction once they have been diagnosed
with a visual impairment. Thus, we observe that resilient demand for prescription optical products
contributes to relative stability in the main optical products markets in which we operate during periods
of macroeconomic instability.

_Repurchase and replacement cycle_

The optical products market is characterized by steady repurchase and replacement cycles (2.2 years
in France and 3.9 years in Spain, in 2019). The main drivers for repurchasing or replacing an optical
product are loss, wear and tear, changes in vision, reimbursement cycles (where applicable), evolving
fashion trends and technological improvements. Moreover, many consumers own more than one pair
of glasses (a trend we refer to as "multi-possession") and also tend to own at least one pair of glasses
even if they primarily use contact lenses. Changes in fashion trends also lead to replacement of optical
products, in particular for frames and sunglasses, which are more exposed to evolving fashion trends.

_Social drivers, health, lifestyle and macroeconomics_

Social and economic factors have a significant impact on how eyesight impairments are identified and
treated by consumers. Changing lifestyles, such as increasing numbers of people attending schools
and universities, working skilled and technical jobs, using computers and similar devices (including
uptake on blue-light blocking technology) and driving, and increasing customer focus on health and
wellness are factors that lead to an increased need to maintain good eyesight. Some of these factors
may even aggravate eyesight impairments or cause patients to seek a solution more readily than they
might if they did not think good vision was critical to their quality of life. With generally rising rates of

147


-----

near-sightedness, we expect that increased access to and demand for optical diagnosis and optical
care, as well as increased demand for branded optical products, will continue to drive demand in the
markets in which we operate.

_Reimbursement framework_

Reimbursement frameworks vary across the geographies in which we operate with a relatively high
level of reimbursement being available in France, and a relatively low-level of reimbursement being
available in other countries. For example, in France, the optical products market is characterized by
high levels of reimbursement through private health insurers (OCAMs, including CMU) and care
networks: more than 99% of the French population was covered by private health insurance plans or
CMU in 2020, according to Gallileo. In 2020, a market survey by Gallileo indicated that the French
population was split among CMU-Complémentaire Santé beneficiaries (10%), private individual health
insurance beneficiaries (43%) and private collective insurance beneficiaries (46%), with only 1% people
not having any insurance coverage. Additionally, the French _Accord National Interprofessionnel (the_
"ANI"), requires all employers to offer complementary health insurance to their employees, thus
increasing the percentage of the population covered by employer-provided insurance, which often
provides more generous reimbursement as compared with the coverage provided by the baseline
private insurance held by individuals through the OCAMs. Thus, in spite of low levels of reimbursement
for optical products from the French public health system (approximately 4% of in 2017), due to the
prevalence of private insurance coverage through the OCAMs (which reimbursed approximately 70%
of optical products expenses in 2020, according to Gallileo), the French reimbursement framework is
overall favorable to us because it allows for generally low out-of-pocket costs for our end-customers
(approximately 30% in 2020), which in turn helps drive and sustain demand.

In contrast, the optical products markets in Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal are characterized
by (i) low levels of coverage for optical costs through the public health system, (ii) low levels of
enrollment in private health insurance programs and (iii) regulatory frameworks that are not as
supportive as the one in France, which for example do not require employers to offer complementary
health insurance.

_Regulatory environment_

National optical products markets are subject to various regulations regarding (i) access to the retail
optical products market (e.g., the restrictions in France on the ability to carry out eye tests, examinations
and prescribe prescription for optical products limited to ophthalmologists); (ii) optical products
distribution channels (e.g., by regulating online sales); and (iii) communication, marketing and
advertising (e.g., restrictions on advertising by healthcare professionals, including opticians). For
several years, market regulation in various countries in which we operate has become increasingly
liberal. If this trend towards market liberalization continues, for example through the easing of
restrictions on eye testing and measurement services, the market is expected to become more
accessible to opticians offering a total range of products and services.

_Regulatory changes_

In France, upcoming regulatory changes, which will become applicable from January 2020 onwards,
will change the regulatory environment and also impact the French optical and hearing aid sectors. We
believe that, in 2020, the negative impact of these regulatory changes on the total optical market was a
one-off negative impact of approximately 2% in terms of value, mostly due to the reduction in the
reimbursement threshold on frames from €150 to €100, while in the meantime, growth of 1.1% of the
population wearing spectacles over the period from 2018 to 2024 is expected to compensate part of
this negative impact. The French optical market has been stagnating for almost three years, despite
structural growth factors linked to demographic factors. The impact of those changes on banners and
individual stores will depend, among other factors, on local considerations (for instance the proportion
of wearers who benefit from the CMU, which is unevenly spread across the country) and on our ability
to attract the population asking for the "zero consumer cost" offer and the success of our products to
compensate for the reduction in frames reimbursement. Even if assessing the precise impact of 100%
Santé is made difficult in light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, thus far, uptake on RAC Zéro is
broadly in line with our expectations, with slightly less decline on sales of frames than expected (at less
than 3% according to GfK, and 6% at Gallileo). The measure is expected to impact 5% to 10% of frames
sold in France. For further information about the regulations applicable to the sale of optical products
and hearing aids in France and Spain, our two main markets, see "Regulation".

_Technological advances_

Optical product technology is constantly evolving. These technological evolutions drive increases in
average basket value in the form of product "add-ons", even as ASPs for certain products are in slight
decline. Customers may select one or more supplements to their product, such as multifocal lenses,
polarized lenses or blue-light blocking coatings. The development of polycarbonate lenses (which are
thinner, lighter and more impact-resistant than standard plastic lenses), break-resistant optical frames
(designed with flexible joints and materials that allow a greater degree of bending than conventional
frames), new materials used for contact lenses (such as silicon hydrogel) and higher quality lens
materials (resulting in lenses that are extremely thin or light, progressive, anti-reflective, shock-proof,
photochromatic (light-adaptive or transition lenses), scratch-resistant, polarized, ultraviolet-protective
and blue-light blocking) has led to higher ASPs.

The graphic below presents the estimated impact of certain market growth drivers on the French and
Spanish optical markets for the 2012 and 2019 calendar years.

**_Optical products competitive landscape_**

The national markets in which we operate are fragmented, with independent retailers playing a
significant role and market leaders representing a limited market share of total sector sales, with the
market leader in France representing 13% in 2019 and approximately 12% for the market leader in
Spain for 2018. Our main competitors tend to be small, local competitors, which are easily identified by
customers in those national markets. While there are many regional and national networks of optical
retailers, there are a fairly limited number of multi-national networks like us. The European optical
products market generally includes (i) retail optical chains, (ii) marketing groups, (iii) independent
retailers and members of buying groups and, in France, (iv) mutualists (mutuelles):

  - Retail optical chains include franchise stores, stores fully owned by one company (sometimes
referred to as "integrated networks") or a combination of both franchise stores and ownedstores networks. We have selected the franchise model, which we operate alongside a limited
number of directly-owned stores, as explained further in "Business". In contrast, examples of
retail optical chains using the integrated network model include GrandVision (operating the
banners Grand Optical, Générale d'Optique and Solaris in France), as well as General Óptica
and Óptica 2000 in Spain. Certain of our retail optical chain competitors, such as Générale
d'Optique and General Óptica, also maintain a network of franchised stores, similar to us. To
be considered a "retail optical chain", it must include five or more stores.

  - Marketing groups, which are sometimes organized under a cooperative system and referred to
as "cooperatives", are groups of independent opticians who combine under a single banner
and usually have a shared marketing approach. Opticians in such marketing groups pay a
contribution fee to the group and benefit from various pooled resources and services. All
storeowners in a marketing group have a stake in the group and each is involved in the decisionmaking process.

  - Independent retailers and members of buying groups own and operate their own stores under
their own brands and bear all risks related to their store. Independent retailers may also join
buying groups in order to benefit from better purchasing conditions, but generally do not have

149


-----

the advantage of collective commercial benefits available to those in retail optical chains or
marketing groups.

  - Mutualists are a type of French optical store where, in the past, people with certain insurance
policies (e.g. school teachers) could buy optical products at a much-reduced price, which was
then reimbursed by the health insurance company. This led to the formation of a nation-wide
chain of optical stores, called Les Opticiens Mutualistes (recently renamed _Ecouter Voir)._
Following regulatory change in 2014, Les Opticiens Mutualistes no longer benefit from a
protective statute and now operate like the other retail optical chains in France, although they
are still linked to insurance companies.

In France in 2019, retail optical chains held 38.5% (5.5% more than 2012), marketing groups held 35%
(1% less than 2012), mutualists held 9% (1% less than 2012) and independent retailers and members
of buying groups held 17.5% (3.5% less than 2012) of market value. In Spain in 2018, retail optical
chains held 41% (4% more than in 2013), marketing groups held 32% (8% more than 2013) and
independent retailers and members of buying groups held 26% (12% less than 2013) of market value.
Independent retailers are facing increasing pressure from the expansion of large optical products
distribution networks, including the leading European networks, such as GrandVision (the Netherlands),
Specsavers (United Kingdom), Fielmann (Germany) and Afflelou. The consolidation of optical products
players generally along with forward integration by some optical products suppliers may further increase
competitive pressure within the optical products market. For example, two of the largest industry
players, Luxottica and Essilor, entered into a business combination agreement in January 2017 creating
the Essilor-Luxottica group. Since then, the Essilor-Luxottica group has launched a takeover of
Grandvision, which remains subject to antitrust approval, notably in Europe among other things. In
recent weeks, Essilor-Luxottica announced its agreement to dispose part of its retail base in Belgium,
Netherlands, and Italy, in order to satisfy antitrust authority requests. We expect market consolidation
and concentration to accelerate in the coming years, offering competitive advantages to large players
like us over small and independent retailers, due to greater purchasing power with suppliers, talent
attraction and retention and economies of scale.

**_Our optical products geographic markets_**

Below, we describe the characteristics of the optical products market in both France and Spain, our
main optical products markets and provide overall market figures for Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal,
which correspond to a large proportion of network sales in our Other countries segment.

_France_

_Market size and growth potential_

The total retail value of the optical products market in France (including the French overseas territories)
was approximately €6.6 billion (including VAT and excluding online sales) in 2019, showing an increase
of 3.6% as compared with 2018. The optical market in France was broadly stable between 2015 and
2018, at approximately €6.3 billion, largely as a consequence of regulatory changes that began in 2016,
including the lengthening of the replacement cycle to two years by French public health insurance and
the lowering of the reimbursement thresholds for frames, along with the rapid rise of care networks,
putting pressure on product prices. In 2020, SWV estimated that the French market declined by 8.6%,
to €6.0 billion (as compared to 10.7% as estimated by GfK, and 13.0% as estimated by Observatoire
_de l'Optique), demonstrating resilience in the face of COVID-19-related confinements, including the_
near-complete closures during the first confinement in the spring of 2020. The optical sector is also
supported by demographic trends, as demonstrated by (i) higher volume corresponding to a growing
number of people in need of vision correction and (ii) growth in average basket size due to "add-ons"
and the increase in multifocal lens wearers (growing at 40% of total lens volume in 2020 as compared
to 39% in 2019 and 32% in 2012), which has helped to offset declines in ASPs. Sales in retail values
for contact lenses, care solutions and non-prescription sunglasses have remained stable in value, due
to (i) an ASP decline on sunglasses caused by a growing proportion of own branded products within
large banners, and (ii) a growing proportion of those products being sold through other retail channels
such as internet and specialized retailers.

In France in 2019, the largest segment of the optical products market was the corrective glasses
segment, which represented approximately 83% (which is calculated as the total of lenses (57%) and
frames (26%)) of the total retail value of the market, with total sales of lenses of approximately €3.8
billion and total sales of frames of approximately €1.7 billion (including VAT and excluding online sales).
The market also includes the contact lenses and care solutions segment (7%), the non-prescription

sunglasses segment (7%) and the accessories segment (3%) (including VAT and excluding online
sales). The French optical products market is forecasted to grow in future years, at a 1.0% CAGR from
2019 to 2025, and 3.0% from 2020 to 2025. Additionally, the distribution of products should benefit nondiscretionary products (corrective glasses), growing to 85% of the total market in 2025.

_Market trends_

The French optical products market is characterized by positive demographic, social and economic
drivers as well as a favorable regulatory framework, all of which have contributed to resilience during
difficult economic cycles. We expect that the French optical products market in the coming years will
be supported by a growing, aging population and steady renewal cycles (2.2 years in 2019), while
regulatory changes that came into effect since 2016 and which have been implemented since 2020
(100% Santé and its RAC Zéro offer) and the resulting reduction in the reimbursement caps on frames
from €150 to €100, had a limited, one-off negative impact in 2020 on the average expense for end
customers.

Consumption trends and demographics

As is true in the optical products market generally, population growth and the aging of the overall
population are expected to continue to increase demand for optical products in France. The French
population is expected to continue growing moderately at a CAGR of 0.3% over the 2020 to 2025 period.
The percentage of the population using optical products is expected to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% over
the same period. The share of the French population aged 45 and older is estimated to increase at a
CAGR of 0.6% over the 2020 to 2025 period. The increasing number of older people in France, a
majority of whom will require progressive lenses (which have higher ASPs than unifocal lenses) together
with general volume growth is expected to support market growth and offset the impact of longer
renewal cycles.

Social drivers

We believe that the French optical products market will also benefit from certain social drivers which
lead to increased volumes and higher average basket sizes. These social drivers include (i) increased
awareness of the need to protect eyes from sun exposure; (ii) higher demand for branded optical
products; (iii) higher demand for multiple pairs of glasses; and (iv) customers' increased interest in highvalue products, such as blue-light blocking lenses that address the growing prevalence of eye strain
resulting from increased exposure to digital displays.

Reimbursement framework and regulatory environment

The French optical products market has shown resilience in challenging economic environments, due
in part to a supportive healthcare reimbursement system that effectively limits the out-of-pocket cost of
optical products to customers. In France, the optical products market is characterized by high levels of
reimbursement through private health insurers (the OCAMs). A significant portion of the cost of optical
products is covered by OCAMs, which reduces customers' exposure to the price of optical products. In
2017, OCAMs and the public health system reimbursed on average 70% to 75% of such expenses.
OCAMs, together with CMU, and _aide à la complémentaire santé_ ("ACS") (these two entities are
expected to merge as a consequence of the 100% Santé changes) allow almost all of the French
population to be covered by a complementary health insurance. Care networks are intermediary parties
between the OCAMs and healthcare professionals, including opticians, which were implemented to
allow OCAMs to control reimbursements to healthcare professionals. OCAMs may choose to apply
different levels of reimbursement depending on whether the customer makes his or her purchase from
an optician admitted to a relevant care network. Customers are therefore encouraged to choose an
optician admitted to a relevant care network as the consumer will receive a higher reimbursement from
the OCAM. More than 85% of the French population was covered by an OCAM as of 2018, and
approximately 70% of OCAMs, were linked to a care network and approximately 30% of the customers
used their care network to purchase glasses, according to a recent Galileo study.

Additionally, the ANI requires all employers to offer complementary health insurance to their employees,
thus increasing the percentage of the population covered by employer-provided insurance, which often
provides more generous reimbursement as compared with the coverage provided by the baseline
private insurance held by individuals through the OCAMs. Thus, in spite of low levels of reimbursement
for optical expenses from the French public health system, due to the prevalence of private insurance
coverage through the OCAMs and the ANI, the French reimbursement framework is overall favorable
to us because it allows for generally low out-of-pocket costs for our end-customers, which in turn helps

151


-----

drive and sustain demand. Furthermore, our end-customers in France are also able to benefit from
third-party payment (tiers payant), a mechanism which allows for the reimbursement of medical
expenses to be paid directly by the public health system and/or OCAMs to the individuals or entities
that provided the service. Certain recent changes in the French regulatory system have impacted, and
are expected to continue to impact, the French optical products market as discussed further in
"Regulation".

_Our competitors and competitive position in France_

The French optical products market is composed of retail optical chains (such as Générale d'Optique,
Optical Center and us), marketing groups (such as Optic 2000, Krys and Atol), mutualists (Les Opticiens
Mutualistes (recently renamed Ecouter Voir)), independent retailers and members of buying groups. In
2019, retail optical chains held 38.5% (5.5% more than 2012), marketing groups held 35% (1% less
than 2012), mutualists held 9% (1% less than 2012) and independent retailers and members of buying
groups held 17.5% (3.5% less than 2012) of market value.

In 2019, Alain Afflelou was the largest retail optical chain and the third largest banner in the French
optical products market with 9.7% market share in terms of turnover (including VAT), behind two
marketing groups, Optic 2000 (12.8% market share) and Krys (12.9% market share) and ahead of
Optical Center (9.1% market share). By 2019, we had gained 0.8% of market share as compared to our
8.9% market share in 2015. The two largest discount retailers, Optical Center and Générale d'Optique,
followed with 9.2% and 8.0% market share, respectively.

_Spain_

_Market size and growth potential_

The total retail value of the Spanish optical products market amounted to approximately €1.9 billion
(including VAT and excluding online sales) in 2019. The Spanish optical products market grew by 1.4%
in 2019. In 2020, the Spanish optical market declined by 17.3% as estimated by SWV (18.3% as
estimated by GfK), while non-discretionary products, which are our core offering, only declined by
13.5%.

In Spain in 2019, the largest segment of the optical products market was the corrective lenses segment,
which represented approximately 48% of the total retail value in the optical products market, with total
sales (including VAT and excluding online sales) of €0.9 billion. The frames segment was the second
largest market segment representing approximately 22% of the total retail value in the market with total
sales (including VAT and excluding online sales) of €0.4 billion. The market also includes the contact
lenses and care solutions segment (approximately 14%), the sunglasses segment (approximately 13%)
and the accessories segment (approximately 3%). The Spanish optical products market is forecast to
grow by a CAGR of 0.9% over the 2019 to 2025 period and 5.0% over the 2020 to 2025 period, showing
a strong recovery following the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.

_Market trends_

The Spanish optical products market is smaller than that of France, largely due to the relatively low
proportion of the Spanish population that has private health insurance and the lack of reimbursement
by public health insurance. Spanish customers generally bear most of the cost of optical products as
an out-of-pocket expense, which explains, at least in part, why the Spanish optical products market is
more closely tied to macroeconomic indices such as GDP. The renewal cycle for prescription glasses
in 2019 was estimated to be an average of 3.9 years in Spain, as compared to an average of 2.2 years
in France, due to optical products generally not being reimbursed in Spain. However, the Spanish
optical products market is characterized by positive demographic, social and economic drivers. We
believe that in the coming years the Spanish optical products market will benefit from an aging
population, increased demand for branded optical products, an improved macroeconomic environment
and a favorable professional licensing regime with respect to optician-optometrists.

Consumption trends and demographics

The Spanish optical products market is exposed to similar demographic trends as the French optical
products market, notably an aging population. While the Spanish population (approximately 47.1 million
people in 2020) is stable overall, and is forecasted to grow slightly (at a CAGR of 0.4% over the 2020
to 2025 period), the share of the Spanish population aged 45 and older is estimated to increase at a
CAGR of 1.8% over the 2020 to 2025 period, which in turn is expected to lead to increased demand for

152


-----

optical products. In addition, as is the case in France, we expect that Spanish consumer spending will
be characterized by increased interest in branded optical products in the coming years.

Social drivers

The Spanish optical products market is more closely correlated with macroeconomic indices, such as
GDP and disposable income levels, as compared with the French optical products market. Following
the economic crisis, which negatively affected the Spanish optical products market between 2008 and
2013, the economy in recovery since 2014 has allowed for the revival of sales in the Spanish optical
products market.

Reimbursement framework and regulatory environment

Optical products are generally not covered by public health insurance in Spain and the percentage of
the Spanish population with private health insurance is relatively low. Additionally, as is the case in
France, there is a shortage of ophthalmologists in Spain. However, unlike in France, opticianoptometrists in Spain may perform eye exams and write prescriptions for optical products, which
mitigates the impact of the ophthalmologist shortage.

_Our competitors and competitive position in Spain_

In Spain in 2018, retail optical chains held 41% (4% more than 2013), marketing groups held 32% (8%
more than 2013) and independent retailers and members of buying groups held 26% (12% less than
2013) of market value.

In 2018, we were the largest retail optical franchise network in Spain, in number of stores, with the Alain
Afflelou banner representing a 3.3% market share and the second largest retail chain, with a 7.1%
market share (behind Multiopticas, Opticalia and General Optica with a 12.0%, 11.0% and 9.3% market
share, respectively), but ahead of Optica 2000 (with 4.7% market share).

**The hearing aid market**

**_Overview of hearing aids_**

In terms of hearing aids, we operate exclusively in the hearing aids market (as opposed to the hearing
implants market). Like prescription glasses, hearing aids are healthcare products with a frequent
renewal cycle and, in France, strong reimbursement support. Hearing aids are best used in cases of
mild to severe sensorineural hearing loss. While the fundamental components of hearing aids are the
same, the specific components used across different hearing aids can vary significantly. The cost of a
high-end hearing aid can be many times the price of a low-end hearing aid. Such cost differences are
generally driven by the device's software, components and functionality. The market for hearing aid
manufacturers is highly concentrated, with the top six hearing aid manufacturers accounting for
approximately 90% of the market (Sivantos (Siemens)/Widex, Sonova, William Demant, GN Resound,
and Starkey).

**_General hearing aid market drivers_**

As is the case with the optical products market, the hearing aids market consists primarily of national
markets, with each national market being subject to local demographic conditions, regulatory
frameworks, penetration rates and competition. Drivers of the hearing aid market are generally similar
to those of the optical products market in our main geographic markets for hearing aids, France and
Spain. Those drivers consist primarily of a growing population with hearing impairments, which is a
combination of sociological factors (such as the use of headphones and other stresses on hearing) and
the aging of the population (as presbyacousis is, as is the case with presbyopia, a natural result of the
aging process for many people). For instance, while Xerfi forecasts that the French population will grow
at a CAGR of 0.3% per annum from 2020 to 2025, it forecasts that the population having hearing
impairments will grow by 0.9% over the same period, mainly due to the growth of the population of
people aged over 65 being forecast to grow at a CAGR of 0.9% over the same period. However, the
size of the addressable population remains smaller as compared to the optical market, with the percent
of the population having a hearing impairment estimated to be 10.2% of the total French population, as
compared with more than 56% having vision impairment. However, the French hearing aid market is
characterized by lower penetration rates (estimated to be around 40% according to a 2018 EuroTrak
study and may be as low as 35% according to Xerfi in 2020) as compared to over 95% for the French
optical market. The hearing aid market is generally driven by consumption trends and demographics,
social drivers, macroeconomics and technological advances, as is the case with the optical market.

153


-----

_Consumption trends and demographics_

Similarly to the optical products market, we expect that demographic and demand trends will support
growth in the hearing aid market. Hearing loss is an increasingly common and irreversible phenomenon
that comes with aging and which is amplified by certain lifestyle choices, such as living in noisy
environments or excessive use of headphones. The prevalence of hearing loss is positively correlated
with the increasing population of people aged 65 and older (which is expected to grow from 20.5% in
2020 to 22.1% by 2025 in France), as well as with increasing levels of noise pollution. It is estimated
that more than a quarter of the population of people aged 65 and over have some degree of hearing
loss. Thus, as the population ages, the addressable market is expected to grow in parallel. In addition
to an increasing number of new users of hearing aids, we have observed that total market volumes are
also supported by stable replacement rates for existing customers. Generally, hearing aids need to be
replaced every four to five years. However, a large proportion of purchases are driven by loss or
damage. Lastly, as is the case with optical products, hearing aids are somewhat non-discretionary
purchases, as good hearing is essential to being fully cognitive and socially active, which further
supports growth in this market.

_Social drivers, health, lifestyle and macroeconomics_

Penetration rates, which represent the proportion of the population equipped with hearing aids, are
growing steadily and are primarily driven by social and macroeconomic factors, including
reimbursement rates, affordability, levels of social acceptance of such devices and changing lifestyles.
For example, increasing noise pollution in urban areas as well as harmful exposure to loud music
through headphones and at concerts are additional factors that may lead to hearing loss. Social
acceptance of hearing aids, i.e., the absence of stigmatizing those who wear hearing aids, is another
key driver likely to increase hearing aid penetration rates. As previously mentioned, reimbursement
rates impact hearing aid penetration rates. In France, hearing aids are estimated to be reimbursed
around 45% on average, with a personal cost for the consumer of around €750 to €850 (in 2019). The
recent changes brought by 100% Santé are expected to increase the number of people using hearing
aids. Xerfi estimates that the total population of people in France with a hearing impairment to be 6.9
million people in 2020, with only 35% being equipped, according to a 2018 EuroTrak study. Driven by
the 100% Santé changes, Xerfi estimates that this will grow to 43% (3.1 million people) by 2025. In
Spain, reimbursement of hearing aids is even more limited as a result of the fact that the public health
insurance system does not reimburse hearing aid costs and the low percentage of individuals with
complementary health insurance. This has led to a penetration rate of only 13% in Spain. In countries
where reimbursement rates are low or zero, the affordability of hearing aids is particularly important, as
most of the purchase cost is borne by the customer. Additionally, Xerfi indicates that the ability of
customers to acquire hearing aid devices without any out-of-pocket expenses is likely to boost sales. In
recent years, we have observed downward price pressure on hearing aids. ASPs of hearing aids are
expected to continue to decline over time, which we expect will drive volume growth as hearing aids
become increasingly affordable to customers. The ASP of hearing aids was €1,517 in 2018, declining
progressively from a maximum of €1,585 in 2012 and is expected to further decline due to regulatory
changes favoring lower prices, such as 100% Santé with full reimbursement for basic hearing aid
products priced at up to €950. Xerfi estimates that this ASP will decline from €1,545 in 2020 to €1,342
by 2025. We expect that the decline in ASPs will be more than offset by volume growth at a CAGR of
10.6% from 2020 to 2025, mainly as a result of 100% Santé, which is expected to drive demand from
customers who were previously deterred from wearing hearing aids due to the cost, as well as volume
growth driven by demographic factors, such as the aging population in France.

_Technology_

Hearing aid technology is constantly evolving. Technological improvements drive sales of hearing aids
by making them more discreet and improving comfort and functionality. Improvements in microphone
and microchip technology have led to the advent of miniature hearing aids that are virtually invisible,
comfortable to wear, easy to insert and remove and provide better hearing correction. Additionally,
constant technological development creates pricing pressure and promotes affordability, which in turn
drives penetration rates.

**_Hearing aids competitive landscape_**

As is the case with the optical products market, retail competition in the hearing aid market generally
takes place on a national level: competitors are mainly local banners, easily identified by customers.
The geographic markets in which we operate are highly fragmented between retail optical chains and
marketing groups, with independent retailers holding approximately 10% to 20% of the market retail

154


-----

value. While there are many regional and national hearing aid retail chains, there are a fairly limited
number of multi-country chains, such as Amplifon and us. The European hearing aid retail market
generally includes large banners (including retail chains, marketing groups and mutualists (in France))
and independent retailers.

**_Our hearing aid geographic markets_**

We are present in the hearing aid market in both France and Spain, (370 points of sale as of January
31, 2021, of which 93 were stores and 277 were corners), though the majority of our hearing aid points
of sale, and network sales are located and generated in France.

_France_

_Market size and growth potential_

In 2019, the total retail value of the French hearing aid market was estimated by GfK to be €1.5 billion
(including VAT and consumables), with 782,000 hearing aid devices sold, according to SNITEM. This
market grew at a CAGR of 3% between 2016 and 2019. Xerfi estimated the total retail value of the
French hearing aid market to be €1.4 billion in 2020 (3.5% below GfK's estimate for 2019). Xerfi
estimates the market will grow at a CAGR of 7.5% between 2020 and 2025, driven by demographic
factors and the regulatory changes brought by 100% Santé. The population needing hearing aid devices
is expected to continue to grow as the population at large grows and ages. French regulations are
expected to help make hearing aids more affordable through the 100% Santé changes (as discussed
above), which should drive more than 25% of total volume by 2025 according to Xerfi. We expect these
factors will drive volume growth and largely compensate for decreasing ASPs.

_Market trends_

As is the case with the French optical products market, the French hearing aid market is expected to
benefit from favorable demographic trends, including a growing and aging population, which are likely
to drive demand. In France, as of 2020, approximately 10% of the population have a hearing deficiency.
However, we believe that the penetration rate for hearing aids remains low (estimated to be around
40% according to a 2018 EuroTrak study and may be as low as 35% according to Xerfi in 2020), but is
expected to grow over the coming years to 43% in 2025. The currently low penetration rate of hearing
aids is primarily due to a significant number of undiagnosed hearing pathologies as well as pathologies
that go untreated due to high prices of hearing aid equipment before the implementation of 100% Santé
in France, social stigma and a perceived lack of comfort and/or efficacy of certain hearing aid products.
As people become less reluctant to wear those devices, the stigma is reduced, social acceptance
increases and the products become more affordable for consumers (which can now be purchased with
no out-of-pocket cost, thanks to 100% Santé), we believe the penetration rate will continue to grow. On
average, there is a three-year period between the moment a person becomes aware of hearing loss
and their purchase of hearing aids, and generally, people with mild and moderate hearing loss have
lower adoption rates. Hearing aids are used on average for six years before they are replaced. The
repurchase cycle is also expected to shorten as people can obtain hearing aids for free. Finally, we
expect that hearing aid retailers will grow their revenue in other product segments that are linked to the
sale and replacement of the hearing aids and accessories, including batteries, storage cases and
cleaning products.

_Our competitors and competitive position in France_

The primary players in the French hearing aid market are banners and independent retailers. Banners
include retail chains (such as Audika and Amplifon), buying groups (such as Audition Conseil and
Audition Santé), cooperatives (such as Entendre), mutualists (Audition Mutualistes), optical retailers
who also sell hearing aids (such as Optical Center, Audio 2000, Krys and us), as well as hearing aid
specialists and small optical retailers. In France, we believe the largest players in the market are
Amplifon (with an estimated market share of more than 15% in 2019) and Audika (with a market share
of approximately 10%). We believe our network sales from hearing aids account for approximately 3%
of the market in France.

_Spain_

_Market size and growth potential_

Spain is one of the least developed hearing aid markets in Western Europe as Eurotrak identified in a
2018 survey. Spain has the same levels of hearing impairment (as compared to France) and population
equipped with appropriate hearing aid devices (with 11.3% of the population having a hearing

155


-----

impairment and only 36.5% within this category of people being equipped with hearing aids), primarily
due to the low level of reimbursement, lower GDP per capita and societal stigma associated with the
use of hearing aids. However, the Spanish market has benefited from a growth in recent years and is
expected to continue growing, notably as a consequence of the growth of the population aged 65 years
and older.

_Market trends_

Similar to the Spanish optical products market, the Spanish hearing aid market is expected to benefit
from favorable demographic trends, including an aging population, a decline in the social stigma around
hearing aids and an improving macroeconomic environment. In Spain, public health insurance generally
does not cover hearing aids. We do not expect the reimbursement scheme for hearing aids to change
in Spain. Thus, penetration rates will remain closely tied to the ability of market players to offer hearing
aids at affordable prices.

_Our competitors and competitive position in Spain_

The primary players in the Spanish hearing aid market are retail chains and independent retailers. We
believe retail chains account for 80% to 85% of the market, with independent retailers accounting for
the remainder. The recent acquisition of Gaes by Amplifon has reinforced Amplifon's position as leader
in the Spanish hearing aid market.

**Business**

**OVERVIEW**

Founded by Mr. Alain Afflelou in Bordeaux in 1972, we are a leading optical product and hearing aid
franchisor in Europe. We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both
revenue and number of stores and the Alain Afflelou banner is the third-largest optical banner overall
in terms of number of stores, with a 10% market share in 2019 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and
excluding online sales) in a fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers
(according to SWV). In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed
network Spain, our second core domestic market, where we had 336 stores as of January 31, 2021. In
2019, we operated the largest optical product franchise network in Spain (in terms of number of stores)
and were the fourth largest optical retail chain, with a 7% market share in 2018 (in terms of revenue,
including VAT and excluding online sales) (according to SWV). As of January 31, 2021, France, Spain
and Other countries, our three geographic segments, represented 67%, 23% and 10%, respectively, of
our stores. The retail sale of optical products and hearing aids represented 94% and 6%, respectively,
of our network sales for the six months ended January 31, 2021.

Building on our significant market share in our core geographic markets, France and Spain, we have
grown our store networks to 1,435 stores as of January 31, 2021. Our like-for-like growth is in part the
result of market growth at a CAGR of 1.2% and 1.8% in France and Spain, respectively, from calendar
year 2015 to calendar year 2019. In addition, for the same period, network sales for the Alain Afflelou
banner have grown at a CAGR of 4.0% and 2.8%, in France and Spain respectively, and outperformed
the market by an average of 2.8% and 1.0%, in France and Spain respectively, per year as a result of
our brand power and our premium store locations, mainly in city centers and large shopping malls. Our
intensive and long-term marketing and advertising efforts and campaigns (including in partnership with
key brand ambassadors) have driven the success and power of our brand. In our two main secondary
markets, Belgium and Switzerland, network sales for the Alain Afflelou banner grew at a CAGR of 6.4%
and 7.3%, respectively, between 2015 and 2019, versus a CAGR of 1.6% for the market as a whole in
each of those geographies.

We have been strategically adapting our store perimeter in recent years, which has led to an increase
in profitability over the period from 2016 to 2019. As mentioned below, we rely on our strong brand and
large network of franchisees. Each additional store that we open (either in our directly-owned stores
network or in our franchisee store network) allows us to benefit from economies of scale by spreading
our fixed costs over a broader base of stores and sales potential. Such fixed costs include, among other
things, administrative fees and structural costs, franchisor and technical support costs and warehousing
and inventory management costs, as well advertising and marketing costs relating to the promotion of
our brand (which we believe will in turn benefit a larger number of stores and generate a greater volume
of sales).

The essential, healthcare nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that
may, at best, be sometimes delayed but rarely deferred completely. Most of our products are purchased
by our customers as a result of a prescription or a medical need. For example, for the six months ended
January 31, 2021, 93% of our network sales were generated on sales of glasses (representing 86% of
our total network sales) or hearing aids (representing 7% of our total network sales) that were purchased
with a prescription. According to 2020 data from Gallileo, 83% of customers indicated their reason for
purchasing new glasses was the result of a medical need, as compared to 16% who indicated it was
based on personal, non-health-related preferences. In addition, according to 2020 data from Arcane,
89% of customers surveyed indicated that their last eyewear purchase was for prescription glasses.
These dynamics create resilience and predictability in our sales as customers and replace prescription
products in regular and fairly short intervals (especially in countries where we benefit from a favorable
regulatory framework whereby the majority of prescription products are reimbursed by social security
and healthcare insurance providers, as is the case in France, our main market). For example, as of
2019, prescription glasses are replaced on an estimated average of 3.9 years in Spain and 2.2 years
in France, according to SWV. The rest of our sales result from discretionary purchases, such as
sunglasses and optical and hearing aid accessories. Even in times of economic difficulty or pandemics
(such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), customers continue to buy and order glasses while our
stores (which are classified as "essential" businesses, reflecting the healthcare-nature of the products
we sell) remain open or will defer their purchase for only a short period of time. As a demonstration of
this effect, after COVID-19-related confinement periods, we have observed a rebound in sales, which

157


-----

generally outperform the same period in prior years, as customers catch up on overdue purchases for
prescription glasses, lenses or hearing aids.

Our business and sales volume has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but our business has
shown itself to be resilient. The classification of our stores as essential businesses has reinforced the
importance of opticians and audiologists during a severe public health crisis. We have taken several
measures to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental restrictions while safely and
effectively serving our customers, including by implementing health and safety measures and changes
to our commercial operations, delivering continued customer care (even during strict confinement
periods) and accelerating our digital transformation and the development of our e-commerce platform.
Despite the closure of some of our stores located in large shopping malls (pursuant to local and national
requirements), the decrease in sales from these closed stores has been partially compensated by
increased, redirected sales in other stores (for example, in city centers) as customers shift their buying
habits to buy or replace their prescription glasses from another of our stores. In that regard, we have
used our digital platform to assist customers, by expanding and accelerating the transformation and the
range of our online services we provide and which have been heavily relied upon during the COVID-19
pandemic and related confinements, as evidenced by significant expansion in the use of online
appointments and redirection of customer traffic from closed to open stores, as well as by making use
of our customer relationship management system, which give us the ability to better track customer
behavior and forecast business and activities for our franchisees.

We operate in highly attractive markets that are differentiated from traditional retail markets due to the
largely non-discretionary and healthcare-related nature of optical and hearing aid expenses and a
supportive healthcare reimbursement system in France. We believe that both the optical product and
hearing aid markets are supported by positive structural drivers, including demographic trends,
changing lifestyles, technological innovations, product penetration dynamics and value-adding product
add-ons.

In addition, our signature products are a key value differentiator, generating customer interest and good
margins for us and our franchisees. The success of our franchisee-centered business model is
demonstrated by the over-performance of our franchisees as compared to the wider market: average
revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in France in 2019 was €0.9 million, which is approximately
1.6 times the retail market average and approximately 4.0 times the independent and smaller marketing
group retailer store average, and average revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in Spain in
2019 was €0.4 million, which is approximately 2.1 times the retail market average and approximately
4.8 times the independent retailer store average, demonstrating the added value we offer to current and
potential franchisees, which helps us retain current and attract new franchisees.

Our strategy is based on strong branding, exclusive products, multi-possession, payment solutions and
positive customer experience, based on a multi-banner and multi-offer approach that reaches a variety
of price points and target customers. The Alain Afflelou umbrella brand is positioned as a generalist
optical product and hearing aid retailer and includes the highly recognizable "Alain Afflelou" optical
banner as well as the "Alain Afflelou Acousticien" hearing aid banner. We also operate in the discount
activity through the Optical Discount banner mainly in France. Our banners offer a wide range of optical
and hearing aid products, including our exclusive products, which consist of (i) signature label frames
and sunglasses bearing the "Afflelou" signature; (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses;
and (iii) other exclusive brands and third-party names.

We connect with and understand consumers in our markets through our communications and marketing
efforts, which have created a powerful and enduring brand image, as evidenced by our high brand
awareness with customers in our main markets. Among optical retailers, we ranked first in terms of
spontaneous and assisted awareness in France, first in terms of spontaneous awareness in Spain and
first in assisted awareness in Wallonia (Belgium), and ranked second in assisted brand awareness
among hearing aid retailers, according to various market studies conducted in 2018 and 2019. We also
connect with consumers via our online presence. We began developing our online presence in 2012
and have progressively been incorporating our online initiatives under a unified digital umbrella.
Currently we maintain websites in the languages of the principal countries where our banners operate.
Additionally, in September 2016, we acquired two online pure players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com.
We have incorporated the activities of Happyview.fr into our French Afflelou website. Malentille.com
continues to serve customers on its own platform with back-end integration with the Group's online
activities. We continue to explore ways to further expand our online presence and e-commerce
activities.

Our principal activity is to act as a franchisor, licensing the use of our brand and banners to franchisees
and providing them with the right to trade under one of our banners and implement our value proposition
through our commercial offers. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by
(i) serving as flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations; (ii) helping to test
new concepts; and (iii) facilitating store network management.

Our services as franchisor are aimed at helping franchisees grow their sales by fostering a strong brand
image, driving customers to our stores through the design and promotion of our commercial offers and
facilitating franchisee operations via a number of support services. Our scale and expertise yield
tangible benefits to our franchisees, allowing us to offer (i) commercial support and innovation through
new commercial offers and through high-impact national and local communication campaigns that
create high brand awareness; (ii) access to central listing and purchasing unit services that lower costs
for our franchisees; (iii) dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness, including assistance with
location selection and store design; (iv) training programs designed to enhance sales performance; and
(v) other general support functions, including legal, human resources and recruiting assistance, as well
as assistance with joining care networks in France.

Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our global
network of stores. We also provide suppliers with distribution services, including a central listing and
payment unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our franchisees, while offering the
benefit of having a single counterparty for commercial negotiations and payments. We also support
suppliers by actively promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in
our directly-owned stores.

Our franchise model combines: (i) revenue based on network sales of our franchisees (24.6% of our
revenue in the six months ended January 31, 2021), (ii) revenue based on purchases (47.4% of our
revenue in the six months ended January 31, 2021) and (iii) revenue generated by sales to endcustomers in our directly-owned stores (28.0% of our revenue in the six months ended January 31,
2021) and through our websites. Revenue based on network sales includes, in particular: entry fees,
franchise fees and communication fees, as well as other fees charged for services that we provide to
our franchisees. Revenue based on purchases includes, in particular: trading as well as central listing
and payment unit fees and licensing fees and revenue from sales of our exclusive products. Revenue
generated by our directly-owned stores mainly includes sales made directly to end-customers in those
directly-owned stores, as well as through our websites. This model provides us with revenue
diversification.

Our main costs are related to the supply and production of products that we sell under our own brands
or for which we have a license. For our exclusive frames, Okia, a company based in China, has long
been our favored intermediary. Okia is not a manufacturer but sources its products from a network of
independent factories in Asia and allows us to benefit from optimal production conditions through this
unique commercial relationship.

**COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS**

**_We operate in resilient and predictable largely non-discretionary healthcare markets that_**
**_benefit from established structural growth dynamics_**

Our markets are attractive and growing, are differentiated from traditional retail markets by the largely
non-discretionary and healthcare-related nature of most of the optical and hearing aid products we sell,
which drives stability and predictability, and are underpinned by established structural growth dynamics,
including growing and aging populations that are expected to drive increased demand for both optical
and hearing aid products in coming years.

Consumers replace their glasses, contact lenses and hearing aids multiple times over their lifetime and
for a variety reasons, including for health reasons, such as changes in vision and hearing levels, as well
as due to loss, damage, improved technology and changing fashion trends and consumer preferences.
These factors drive stable replacement cycles: for example, as of 2019, the estimated average
replacement cycle for prescription glasses is 3.9 years in Spain and 2.2 years in France (as compared
to 3.8 years and 2.4 years in 2012, respectively), according to SWV. As discussed further below in "—
_We sell essential healthcare-related products, most of which represent non-discretionary spending by_
_our customers, making our business resilient and predictable", most of our products are purchased_
because a customer has a medical need, which distinguishes these products from traditional retail and
consumer goods and creates relative resilience and predictability in our markets.

The market for optical products in our core markets is large: in 2020, 54% of the French population
required vision correction, according to SWV. These markets are also expanding as their populations
age: SWV estimates that, by 2025, 46.7% of the French population and 52.7% of the Spanish population
will be over the age of 45 and that 56% of each of the French population and 53% of the Spanish
population will wear prescription glasses (as compared to 54% and 52% in 2020, and 51%, respectively,
and 48% in 2012, respectively). Because eye and ear conditions, such as farsightedness and agerelated hearing loss, usually develop after the ages of 40 and 55, respectively, and generally become
more common and serious with age, the number of potential customers should increase as a
consequence of the aging of the population in the countries in which we operate, with similar tailwinds
benefitting both optical products and hearing aids.

The optical product and hearing aid markets are also supported by other positive structural demographic
trends and other growth levers, including changing lifestyles, technological improvements and product
penetration dynamics. For example, we believe that evolving technology for corrective lenses and
hearing aids, particularly improvements in multi-focal lenses and increasingly small microphones
leading to smaller hearing aids, as well as shifting customer preferences as seen in increasing demand
for custom lenses, leads consumers to replace old equipment and should contribute to increased
average basket sizes over the mid- to long-term, which we expect to be further aided by favorable
reimbursement dynamics in France, our key market.

As a result of these factors, the French optical products market grew at a compound annual growth rate
("CAGR") of 1.2% over the 2015 to 2019 period, from €6.3 billion to €6.6 billion, declining to €6.0 billion
in 2020, which we believe was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the one-off negative
impact of contraction driven by the 100% Santé changes, and is forecast to grow to €7.0 billion in 2025
(representing a CAGR of 0.7% over the 2019 to 2025 period), the Spanish optical products market grew
at a CAGR of 2.0% over the 2015 to 2019 period, from €1.8 billion to €1.9 billion, declining to €1.6 billion
in 2020, which we believe was largely the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is forecast to grow to
€2.1 billion in 2025 (representing a CAGR of 1.3% over the 2019 to 2025 period), in each case according
to SWV, and the French hearing aid market grew at a CAGR of 4.8% over the 2015 to 2019 period,
from €1.2 billion to €1.5 billion, declining to €1.4 billion in 2020, which we believe was largely the result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is forecast to grow to €2.0 billion in 2025 (representing a CAGR of
43.6% over the 2019 to 2025 period), according to GfK and SNITEM. The chart below shows the
evolution of the optical markets in France, Spain and Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland and the hearing
aid market in France for the calendar years presented, as well as projections for 2025.

We are seeing strong indications of an acceleration in the hearing aid market, particularly in France.
Hearing aids have historically been an under-penetrated product class in our markets with only
approximately 35% to 40% of people in France who need hearing aids being equipped, due in large
part to historically prohibitive costs that have led patients to delay spending on the devices they need.
We expect to see significant growth in the hearing aid market in France in the coming years, resulting
from at least the partial correction of this historic under-penetration and further driven by the regulatory
changes relating to RAC Zéro (the zero-cost to consumer offer under French regulation for hearing aids
(since January 2021)) that have come into effect from January 2021, which make hearing aids
significantly more affordable to those who need them. We believe that many people who require hearing

160


-----

aids in order to help them achieve normal levels of hearing have delayed these purchases due to the
high cost of these products before the implementation of RAC Zéro as well as specifically in anticipation
of the implementation of the RAC Zéro scheme. We expect to benefit from a "catchup effect" in hearing
aid sales in the coming years as people become aware of and are able to benefit from the RAC Zéro
changes.

Xerfi forecasts that the French population will grow at a CAGR of 0.3% per annum from 2020 to 2025
and forecasts that the population having hearing impairments will grow by 0.9% over the same period,
mainly due to the growth of the population of people aged over 65 being forecast to grow at a CAGR of
0.9% over the same period. The French hearing aid market is characterized by lower penetration rates
(estimated to be around 40% according to a 2018 EuroTrak study and may be as low as 35% according
to Xerfi in 2020) as compared to over 95% for the French optical market. Hearing loss is an increasingly
common and irreversible phenomenon that comes with aging and which is amplified by certain lifestyle
choices, such as living in noisy environments or excessive use of headphones. The prevalence of
hearing loss is positively correlated with the increasing population of people aged 65 and older (which
is expected to grow from 20.5% in 2020 to 22.1% in 2025), as well as with increasing levels of noise
pollution. It is estimated that more than a quarter of the population of people aged 65 and over have
some degree of hearing loss. The recent changes brought by 100% Santé are expected to increase the
use of hearing aids. Xerfi estimates that the total population of people in France with a hearing
impairment to be 6.9 million people in 2020, with only 40% being equipped, according to a 2018
EuroTrak study. Driven by the 100% Santé changes, Xerfi estimates that the proportion of people
equipped will grow to 43% (3.1 million people) by 2025.

**_We sell essential healthcare-related products, most of which represent non-discretionary_**
**_spending by our customers, making our business resilient and predictable_**

The healthcare-related nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that
may, at best, be sometimes delayed but rarely deferred completely. Most of our products are purchased
because a customer has a medical need: for the six months ended January 31, 2021, 93% of our sales
were generated on sales of glasses (86%) or hearing aids (7%) that were purchased with a prescription.
According to 2020 data from Gallileo, 83% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing new
glasses was due to need, as compared to 16% who indicated it was based on personal, non-healthrelated preference and, according to 2020 data from Arcane, 89% of customers surveyed indicated that
their last eyewear purchase was for prescription glasses. These dynamics create resilience and
predictability in our markets.

The COVID-19 pandemic has offered strong indications of this resilience: the rebound of our networks
following the initial emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, with 14.3% year-on-year growth in like-forlike network sales in the three months ended October 31, 2020, 10.0% year-on-year growth in like-forlike network sales in the six months ended January 31, 2021 and 25.1% year-on-year growth in Adjusted
EBITDA in the first quarter of the current fiscal year (9.9% in the first half of the current fiscal year)
demonstrates the largely non-discretionary nature of most of our products, as does year-on-year growth
of 26.3% in like-for-like network sales in the six months ended January 31, 2021 in our hearing activity.
We believe that even when certain of our stores have been closed due to COVID-19-related restrictions,
the net result was that many purchases were either merely redirected to other stores in our network,
rather than not being made or being deferred over the long-term, or were merely delayed until our stores
reopened. As evidence of the latter, we observe a "catchup" effect whereby, when our stores reopen
after COVID-19-related closures, we often see customers making purchases that they had been
planning or waiting to make during such closures.

Additionally, measures aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19 have evolved favorably for our
industry in our core geographies. For example, since the second confinement in France, which began
in November 2020, the sale of optical and hearing aid products has been deemed an "essential" service,
in recognition of the non-discretionary healthcare needs addressed by these items, which has generally
allowed our stores to remain open (where not otherwise limited by other restrictions that are not specific
to the optical and hearing aid sectors, such as those currently in place for large shopping centers in
France). This represents a significantly improved operating environment for our industry, as compared
to the more restrictive and exceptional confinement measures imposed in France during the first wave
of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, when our stores were generally limited to providing
"emergency" services.

Finally, we believe that our franchisees have weathered the COVID-19 pandemic well overall. For
example, we are observing that few of our franchisees are continuing to request payment deferrals in

161


-----

connection with COVID-19-related financial challenges and most are in the process of paying back
previously-requested deferrals, which we believe is an indicator of their financial stability.

**_We benefit from a highly-developed and supportive reimbursement system for healthcare-_**
**_related products in our core French market_**

Regulatory dynamics in France have historically been favorable to our business, as well as being stable
over the long-term, which has further driven resilience and predictability in our French business. In
addition, we believe that recent regulatory changes will be, on the whole, neutral for our optical business
and beneficial for our hearing aids business.

For our business, the key benefit of the French health insurance reimbursement framework is that it
has the overall effect of reducing the price sensitivity of our customers and coverage by the private
segment of this framework is nearly total: in 2020, approximately 99% of the French population was
covered by a private health insurance plan or CMU, according to Gallileo. While the French public health
insurance system reimburses only approximately 4% of customers' optical expenses, the policies of
French private health insurance companies (organismes complémentaires d'assurance maladie, known
as "OCAMs") generally reimbursed at least 70% of such expenses in 2020, according to Gallileo.
The 100% Santé regulatory changes, including the RAC Zéro offer, have had the further effect of
reducing customer price sensitivity as well as reducing out-of-pocket customer costs for both optical
and hearing aid products, which we believe will drive sales going forward, particularly for our hearing
aid products. With the full impact of RAC Zéro taking effect from January 2021, customers can now
purchase hearing aids at zero out-of-pocket cost (as is already the case for optical products). According
to a 2018 EuroTrak customer survey, people wait an average of three years between becoming aware
of their hearing loss and purchasing hearing aids, while hearing aids are used for an average of six
years before being replaced. We expect the long-term impact of RAC Zéro to include motivating
customers who previously deferred hearing aid purchases to make such purchases, particularly for
customers who were deferring such purchases in anticipation of the RAC Zéro changes coming into
effect.
**_We are a deeply-entrenched optical and hearing aid market leader that benefits from high_**
**_brand awareness_**

We are a well-known and trusted leader in the optical and hearing aid markets in which we operate.
The Alain Afflelou umbrella brand is positioned as a generalist optical and hearing aid retailer and
includes our deeply-entrenched "Alain Afflelou" optical banner and our "Alain Afflelou Acousticien"
hearing aid banner.

The Alain Afflelou banner benefits from high brand awareness across our main geographies,
consistently ranking #1 in spontaneous and assisted awareness for optical retailers in France (as
measured by Arcane, Galileo and Opinionway), as well as in Spain (as measured by Punto de Fuga),
and #2 in French-speaking regions of Belgium (as measured by CSA). We believe that we are wellpositioned to maintain this market-leading brand awareness as these markets grow and evolve.

We regularly receive awards for our offering and our customer service. We have also won a number of
industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer service provider of the year by the
_Elu service client de l'année (ESCDA)_ market survey, conducted by Viseo Customer Insights, in France
for five years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021), "Óptica del año" by Inma Stratmarketing for
best optician in Spain in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, "best franchise in shopping centre" by the
Asociación Española de Centros Comerciales in 2018 and "foreign franchise with the best implantation
in the Spanish market" by the Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018, as well as for our television
and video advertisements which customers easily recall. Some of our franchisees also won the award
of best hearing aid and optical franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020 by the Fédération des Réseaux
_Européens de Partenariats et de Franchise (IREF)._

We have a long history of developing successful marketing and branding concepts, offers and products,
such as Tchin Tchin (second pair of glasses for €1, launched in 1999), NextYear (payment in
installments over 12 to 24 months, launched in 2009) and Magic (innovative glasses with magnetic
clips, launched in 2017), which we believe help us grow and maintain our high levels of brand
awareness and keep our brand fresh and top of mind with new and potential customers. Where
appropriate, we sometimes expand a brand concept across our product offerings, as we did when we
brought our Tchin Tchin concept to our hearing aid banner in 2019.

**_We are a leading European franchisor, with a proven business model that is founded on long-_**
**_standing and strong relationships with franchisees and is positioned at the heart of the value_**
**_chain_**

We are one of the leading franchisors in the European optical product and hearing aid markets, with
over forty years of experience partnering with our franchisees in our core markets (France and Spain)
as well countries that border our core markets (Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Portugal) and
satellite markets in the Middle East, Africa, Asia and South America, where we continue to grow
strategically. Our franchise business is our core activity: as of January 31, 2021, our franchised store
network included 1,435 stores, which generated network sales of €428.8 million in the six months ended
January 31, 2021. During the same period and despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we succeeded in
opening 34 stores across our network.

We have developed our successful franchise model, which has particular, historical strength in the
optical product sector, by combining the power of our brands with commercial innovations and close
relationships with franchisees and suppliers: we believe this model sets us apart from our competitors.

Since 2003, we have successfully taken this differentiated operating model, which we have developed
and refined with decades of experience in our core geographical and product markets, and rolled it out
to other countries, as seen by our success in building our networks in Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and
Luxembourg, in particular. We have historically had good results in rolling this model out in countries
with French-speaking populations but believe this model also works well in non-French speaking
countries and regions, as shown by the strength of our network in Spain. Since 2011 (save for 2013 to
2016, during which period LSFA developed the hearing aid business in France outside of the Group),
we have also rolled this model out in the hearing aid markets in France and Spain, demonstrating that
it works well across complementary product groups as well as across strategically-selected
geographies.

We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both revenue and number
of stores and the Alain Afflelou banner is the third-largest optical banner overall in terms of number of
stores, with a 10% market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) in a
fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers (according to SWV).

In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network Spain, our
second core domestic market, where we had 336 stores as of January 31, 2021. In 2019, we operated
the largest optical product franchise network in Spain in terms of number of stores) and were the fourth
largest optical retail chain, with a 7% market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding
online sales) (according to SWV).

In the hearing aid market, under our Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner, we have grown faster than the
market average (57.4% over the 2016 to 2019 period, as compared to 9.3%, according to GfK) and
held an approximately 3% market share in France in 2020 (in terms of network sales). We operate Alain
Afflelou Acousticien with fundamentally the same sustainable business model as our successful Alain
Afflelou banner, including as to how contributions and fees are paid from franchisees. As a result, we
believe that, over the long-term, profit levels at Alain Afflelou Acousticien will eventually converge with
and stabilize at levels comparable to our Alain Afflelou banner.

Our business model is mature and well-developed, with a controlled fixed cost base such that, when
sales increase, we benefit from economies of scale that drive higher margins. In addition, our franchise
model combines multiple sources of revenue from both franchisees (comprising franchise fees (entry
fees and royalty fees) and communication fees, as well as wholesale activity revenue from the sale of
exclusive own-branded products and central purchasing unit revenue) and suppliers (comprising central
listing and payment fees and license royalties). This approach provides us with revenue diversification
and attractive margins, as demonstrated by our 23.4% and 28.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted
EBITDA as a percentage of revenue, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) for the twelve and six months ended
January 31, 2021, respectively. We also leverage our directly-owned store network to manage, support
and develop our franchise business. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity
by serving as flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations, helping to test
new concepts and facilitating store network management.

The success of our franchisee-centered business model is also demonstrated by the over-performance
of our franchisees as compared to the wider market: average revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou
banner in France in 2019 was €0.9 million, which is approximately 1.6 times the retail market average
and approximately 4.0 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store average and

163


-----

average revenue per store in our Alain Afflelou banner in Spain in 2019 was €0.4 million, which is
approximately 2.1 times the retail market average and approximately 4.8 times the independent retailer
store average, demonstrating the added value we offer to current and potential franchisees, which helps
us retain current and attract new franchisees.

The success of our business model is founded on our place at the center of the relationships among
our suppliers, franchisees and customers, which brings value to each of these groups. For example,
our scale and expertise generates multiple synergies and offers tangible benefits to our franchisees.
For example, we provide our franchisees with commercial support and innovation through new
commercial offers, including high-impact national and local advertising campaigns that create high
brand awareness, access to central purchasing unit services that lower their costs, dedicated services
that enhance store attractiveness (including assistance with location selection and store design),
training programs designed to enhance sales performance and other general support functions,
including human resources, recruiting assistance and financing assistance. Our signature products are
another key value differentiator for our franchisees, generating customer interest, with affordable
products that offer good margins, which benefit our franchisees as well as us.

We support our franchisees with long-term commitments to their success, as shown by how we help
our franchisees adapt to change, such as through our Adelante financial support program (which we
believe is a differentiator that few of our competitors are able to match), our Elite program (which is
designed to assist franchisees that are underperforming), assistance with store refurbishments and
support for adding hearing aid corners that make optical stores more attractive. We are also there to
help our franchisees face exceptional challenges: throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have
supported our franchisees in a variety of ways, including offering solutions that allowed them to defer
an aggregate of €30 million in franchisee payables, in addition to €15 million of bank loans that we
guaranteed. Repayments on these deferred amounts have been steady thus far and are expected to
generate exceptional cash flows in the second half of the current fiscal year.

Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our large
store network. We provide suppliers with distribution services, such as access to our central listing and
payment unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our large network of franchisees.
We also centralize payments from our networks to obtain optimal terms and facilitate credit
management, to the benefit of these suppliers. We further support suppliers by jointly developing and
actively promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directlyowned stores. We believe that this value-added approach creates stable and reliable relationships with
our suppliers, which in turn drives cost-efficiency for us and makes us a more attractive partner to our
franchisees.

**_Our multi-dimensional business model is data-driven, flexible and tailored to our customers'_**
**_needs_**

We leverage our historical strength in the French and Spanish optical product markets and employ a
generalist concept that is primarily focused on city centers, while strategically diversifying our offering
to respond to changing dynamics in our markets. To that end, we have developed (i) a multi-channel
concept that is supported by the execution of a digital transformation plan that helps us tailor our
customers' experiences to their needs and preferences, while expanding our digital presence with "clickand-mortar" functionality, (ii) multiple store formats that respond to varied customer preferences while
actively managing our store networks to adapt to evolutions in our markets and (iii) a complementary
hearing aid business, grounded in standalone franchised stores as well as value-additive hearing aid
corners within existing optical stores. We believe that this approach and these developments help us
better serve our customers and our franchisees and in turn makes us an attractive partner for our
suppliers.

  - _Multi-channel, digital evolution of our business model_

In recent years, we have invested deeply in digital transformation focused on developing forwardthinking, multi-format and fully-integrated customer relationship management ("CRM") tools, which
make valuable data available to us that help us understand our customers and tailor our offerings to
meet and anticipate their needs. We made investments of approximately €3.0 million in these tools in
the six months ended January 31, 2021. We are currently very well-equipped to gather and analyze
data from our franchisees, websites and directly-owned stores: most of our franchisees provide us with
sell-out data, which we use to understand customer behavior and to adjust our purchases based on
evolutions in customer preferences. We believe that we are well-positioned to pivot from the investment

164


-----

phase of our digital transformation and CRM plan to a growth phase that puts this data to work for us
and for our franchisees.

In our core markets, prescription healthcare-related products require in-store appointments and inperson consultations with licensed opticians and audio prosthetists. As these in-person consultations
cannot be provided online, we believe our extensive store network in France and Spain provides us
with a significant advantage over disintermediated online retail platforms.

We also continue to develop our online tools to provide our customers with an integrated shopping
experience that is complementary to our store networks, to the benefit of our franchisees as well as us.
Our websites offer inspiration to our customers, who can browse, select and order frames online for
delivery in a store, where their glasses are fitted and lenses are mounted by our trusted professionals.
By allocating online-generated sales to specific stores, we increase store traffic and limit
cannibalization, to the benefit of our franchisees.

We are also increasingly promoting the use of online bookings for in-store appointments, which reduces
wait times, improves store efficiency and also helps to drive traffic into stores, with significant customer
uptake on this value-added service in past year. In January 2021, approximately 25,000 in-store
appointments (21% of total in-store appointments and a 15% increase from January 2020) were booked
online, as compared to approximately 200 in January 2020. This tool helps us to track and forecast
flows in our business and to re-direct traffic as needed, creating more predictability for our stores and
letting us offer a more personal experience to our customers.

In recent years, we have made successful acquisitions in the online space, with the purchase of
Happyview.fr and Malentille.com in 2016, and we continue to explore ways to continue to strategically
expand our presence in the online market for optical products and to acquire know-how to replicate
across our existing online platforms. We are present on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok) and have developed apps and webtools that our customers
can use to interact with our product offering, for example allowing them to book appointments, track
their contact lens replacement cycle, to locate the nearest store or to virtually try on our frames. We are
currently developing a comprehensive approach for our digital business, in order to have a first-mover
advantage in regards to digital transformation, consistent with our historical marketing positioning, and
in light of the fact that e-commerce penetration in our sector remains in its early stage.

  - _Multi-format business model, continuously adapted to meet the future_

We actively manage our store networks and store formats, using our expertise to identify changes in
the market and to adapt our store locations, formats and sizes to meet demand and emerging
opportunities, including through strategic relocations, adjustments to store sizes in city centers and
development of larger store formats outside city centers. In recent years, a growing share of our
franchised stores have been located in shopping centers and retail parks. While these locations have
been impacted to a greater degree than certain other store formats during the latter part of the COVID19 dynamic, we are optimistic that we will continue to be able to adapt our networks to meet customer
demand going forward.

  - _Multi-offering approach, combining our historical optical business with a complementary_
_hearing aid offering that responds to anticipated growth in demand supported by a new,_
_supportive healthcare framework in France_

Since 2011 (save for 2013 to 2016, during which period LSFA developed the hearing aid business in
France outside of the Group), we have pursued a multi-offer strategy through the creation of our
complementary Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner in the French and Spanish hearing aid markets, as
well as our Afflelou Sun concept in France and Spain. We have modelled the Alain Afflelou Acousticien
strategy on our successful approach in the French and Spanish optical product markets, capitalizing on
key success factors, such as our experience as a large franchisor, our strong brand awareness, our
disruptive, price-focused approach and our history of commercial innovation, and leveraging our
significant store network to develop cross-selling opportunities and synergies, such as through the
opening of hearing aid corners within optical stores, and to expand our footprint in a cost efficient
manner.

We believe the 100% Santé changes that took full effect in France from January 2021 will drive
increased penetration in the currently underpenetrated French hearing aid market, as these products
are now significantly more affordable for those who need them but are not yet equipped or those who
may need to replace their existing equipment. We believe our well-established Alain Afflelou banner is

poised to capture growth in this market in which we believe there is significant growth potential in the
mid- to long-term.

**_We have a robust financial track record of high profitability, healthy cash generation and_**
**_steady deleveraging_**
Our business model, based on our highly-developed franchise business and asset-light, controlled fixed
cost base that requires limited working capital and capital expenditure, drives our stable, healthy and
predictable margins and cash generation. Before COVID-19, our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
network sales was consistently above 10% and our free cash flow was consistently above 80%, in each
case from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 to the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2020 (preIFRS 16), while the ratio of our third-party net debt to our Adjusted EBITDA declined steadily from 5.7x
as of July 31, 2016 to 4.3x as of January 31, 2020 (pre-IFRS 16). The table below presents our thirdparty net debt and leverage (pre-IFRS 16) from July 31, 2016 to January 31, 2021. See "Presentation
_of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures—Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized_
_EBITDA"._

_Note: (1) Based on pre-IFRS 16 Normalized EBITDA of €89.0 million._
Despite the impact of COVID-19, we have reduced our net debt by €29.2 million from January 31, 2020
to January 31, 2021 (pre-IFRS 16). The graphics below show our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of
network sales and our free cash flow and free cash flow conversion (in each case, pre-IFRS 16) from

_Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information" and "Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information—Other Financial Measures—Adjusted EBITDA and Normalized EBITDA"._

_Source: Group information._

As a franchisor, we have built an asset-light model that requires limited capital expenditure to expand
our networks, as almost all capital expenditures for the franchised stores in our networks are borne by
our franchisees, who are responsible for their own store investments. From time to time, we support the
expansion of the network through our Adelante program, which assists our franchisees in raising bank
lending for expansions. We only bear the investment costs for our limited network of directly-owned
stores, which also helps us keep our capital expenditure needs relatively low: these needs generally
correspond to the maintenance of our directly-owned stores perimeter and the purchasing and selling
of directly-owned stores on behalf of franchisors.

Our financial performance is also bolstered by strong network sales, which grew in the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019, to €818.5 million, as compared to €781.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018
and €752.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017. Despite the impact of COVID-19, we have
still generated strong network sales since the start of the pandemic, with network sales in the six months
ended January 31, 2020 of €388.0 million, as compared to €401.9 million for the six months ended
January 31, 2019, and €428.8 million for the six months ended January 31, 2021. Our store count and
network sales have benefited from the acquisitions described above, as well as the strength and
reputation of our franchise network, which incentivizes franchisees to open new stores and expand our
store network. This growth was evidenced by an increase in our revenues and our ability to maintain
Adjusted EBITDA margins above 20% for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019
(on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), as well as a 23.4% and 28.4% Adjusted EBITDA margin (Adjusted EBITDA
as a percentage of revenue, on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) for the twelve and six months ended January 31,
2021, respectively. We believe that strong network sales performance is a lever that can drive bottomline improvement, particularly in our hearing aids business and in our networks in countries that border
our core markets, where we believe there is room to grow off the back of economies of scale driven by
our franchise model and fixed cost base, as network sales growth generally requires limited capital
expenditure.

_Note: (1) Pro forma adjusted for LSFA’s network sales in France in fiscal year 2015. LSFA was_

Additionally, we have historically achieved strong cash flow generation and attractive free cash flow
conversion dynamics, with a 78.0% free cash flow conversion rate for the six months ended January
31, 2021, as a result of our limited capital expenditure needs and working capital requirements. We also
believe there are significant profitability upside opportunities from operating leverage within our
developing businesses, such as our hearing aids business and our operations in countries that border
our core markets.

We also have limited working capital requirements, supported by the soundness of our network and
quality of their payments. As noted above, we have provided financial assistance to our franchisees to
help them weather the COVID-19 pandemic. On the whole, franchisees have repaid amounts borrowed
in short order (with just €12.6 million of such COVID-19 loans to franchisees being outstanding as of
January 31, 2021, as compared to €25.7 million as of July 31, 2020) and repayments on these deferred
amounts are expected to generate exceptional cash flows in the second half of the current fiscal year
of around €2 million per month). Further, in our Alain Afflelou banner in France, a very limited number
of stores have requested support or have had difficulties satisfying their monthly payment obligations
relating to our central payments structure since the start of the current fiscal year, which we believe is
an indicator of our franchisees' financial stability.

We had a strong liquidity position of €117.4 million as of January 31, 2021 (as compared to €76.9 million
at July 31, 2020, showing how our liquidity has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic thus far).

These factors contribute to a robust record of cash generation, strong free cash flow, free cash flow
conversion and profitability. Our profitability combined with strong cash flow generation and limited
capital expenditures needs and working capital requirements have allowed us to reduce our leverage:
the ratio of our third-party net debt to our Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 5.7x as of July 31, 2016 to
4.6x as of January 31, 2019. Supported by our operational performance and cashflow generation, we
have de-levered by 1.6x since the 2017 refinancing, building cash on balance sheet to €117 million as
of January 31, 2021. We will be refinancing the Existing Notes, be fully paying down the PGE Loans
and have €30 million available under the New Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the
Transactions, bringing the opening liquidity position to approximately €41 million. _Pro forma for the_
Transactions, our net secured debt ratio and our total net debt ratio will be 3.8x and 5.2x, respectively,
based on Normalized EBITDA of €104.1 million.

**_We are led by an experienced management team with a proven track record_**

We benefit from the experience and industry know-how of our senior management team. The NonExecutive Chairperson of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, Rachel Marouani, started her career in

168


-----

1994 at Alain Afflelou and in the following decades gained significant experience with Frantour, Accor
Group and LVMH Group. Rachel was CEO of FRED Jewelry from 2012 to 2017 and CEO of Make Up
For Ever from 2017 to 2019. She has been awarded the French Government "Médaille nationale du
_mérite" for her contribution to commerce. The members of our executive committee have an average_
of 12 years of experience with the Group, and most have worked together as a team for many years
and benefit from significant experience in the retail, optical and hearing aid industries, in addition to
having a thorough understanding of the regulatory dynamics in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our
management team has delivered significant operational improvements in recent years and achieved
consistent Adjusted EBITDA growth in recent years despite evolving market conditions.

**STRATEGY**

Our strategy has six pillars: (i) increase our franchise network footprint in our domestic markets through
new store openings while continuing to optimize our efficiently-managed network and enhance our
multi-channel offering; (ii) achieve our digital transformation goals, (iii) drive organic growth through
marketing innovation and central support to franchisees; (iv) accelerate our expansion in the hearing
aid markets with support in France from the 100% Santé changes that are expected expand this market;
(v) further penetrate the European market in border countries and focus on network density and (vi)
continue delivering operating efficiencies at Group-level.

**_Increase our franchise network footprint in our domestic markets_**

We intend to further develop our network through new franchised store openings in our domestic
markets (France and Spain) within our Alain Afflelou banner, while continuing to optimize our network,
including our first price banner. We believe that there is still headroom to add to our Alain Afflelou
networks in France and Spain. We also believe we will be in a position to seize opportunities, both in
terms of white space in the retail space that has emerged since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic and due to more independent opticians being willing to join a larger banner. In past years,
we have offered strong support to franchisees in order to expand our network, such as our Adelante
program in France and Spain, which facilitates the opening and purchase of optical stores for new
franchisees. We also believe there are also several avenues for continued network optimization,
including more actively managing our network and redeploying stores in order to capture more
consumer traffic.

**_Achieve our digital transformation goals_**

We intend to continue implementing our digital transformation, which is a process we accelerated during
2020, in part as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as through the shift to significant numbers
of online appointment bookings during 2020, which helps our franchisees to redirect customers and to
carefully observe relevant restriction measures.

Our digital transformation plan relies on a data-centric approach, in which we have made significant
investments and have achieved notable success in recent years. We have a large customer database
and have put in place strong support system from our franchisees and links with their point-of-sale
systems, which we believe helps us to offer better service to customers. We believe that continuing to
implement our digital transformation plan, including by optimizing our existing framework and rolling out
new tools will help us increase the loyalty of our existing clients and as well as to attract new clients.
Part of our digital transformation plan also involves the roll-out of digital screens, tablets and other
innovative tools that are aimed at improving the customer experience in the store. On the
communication side, we also intend to continue growing our presence on various social media
platforms, as a growing part of our total communication efforts. Finally, we intend to strengthen the
multi-channel experience we offer to our customers. We currently have a "click-and-mortar" approach
that encourages customers to explore and test products online before ultimately buying products in one
of our stores. Through our online offers at Afflelou.com and Malentille.com, we also continue to serve
customers online. As an example of this approach, we opened our first fully digitalized store in Portal
de l'Àngel, Barcelona in April 2021.

**_Drive organic growth through marketing, innovation and central support to franchisees_**

We intend to continue growing our store network by enhancing our brand image, including by promoting
awareness of our banners and commercial offers, remaining engaged with customers and potential
customers through innovative communications campaigns and further strengthening access to potential
customer pools by encouraging and assisting franchisees' accession to care networks in France. With
respect to our franchised store network, we will seek to maintain our strong framework of services and

169


-----

support functions to enhance franchisee customer service and financial performance, including
opening, day-to-day and ad hoc support, such as through access to our central purchasing unit services,
our expanded prêt-à-porter logistics platform and customer relations training programs that acquaint
franchisees and their employees with the benefits of our latest commercial offers. We believe these
services increase customer satisfaction and improve performance in our stores, which are key drivers
of our financial performance. We will continue to extend a variety of services that we have put in place
in recent years, like training (including e-training) for our franchises and dedicated support (such as our
_Elite program, which is designed to assist franchisees that are underperforming. Additionally, we intend_
to continue our rollout of a multi-offer approach, converting existing franchisees into operators under
both our optical and hearing aid banners, such as by encouraging optical franchisees to add hearing
aid or sunglasses corners in their stores. We believe that our strong focus on cultivating and promoting
our franchisee-centered business model will continue to support robust levels of revenue per store in
France and Spain, which have historically outperformed independent retailers' levels of sales.

**_Accelerate further expansion in hearing aid products in all existing markets_**

We intend to continue our rapid expansion into the hearing aid market, with the aim of becoming a
reference brand in this market. In France, we benefit from the 100% Santé changes, which make
hearing aids significantly more affordable than they were previously and than they are in many other
markets. In addition to benefitting from strong intrinsic growth in the market, driven by an aging and
growing population, coupled with relatively low equipment penetration rates which are expected to
increase the population of hearing aid wearers at a CAGR of 5% over the 2020 to 2025 period, and a
supportive healthcare reimbursement system in France, we believe there is further growth potential in
our existing countries of operation.

Our strategy in the hearing aids business is based on synergies with our historical optical business. On
one hand, our combined offering provides consumers with the convenience of acquiring both products
at a single location, based on the fact that there is substantial overlap in the population seeking vision
correction and the population seeking hearing aids. On the other hand, opticians and hearing aid
specialists in our network benefit both from these synergies, with opticians welcoming new potential
clients under the hearing aids offers, while hearing aid specialists benefit from premium locations inside
our optical network. Additionally, we believe that our strong brand equity will benefit from the growth of
each banner.

Our hearing aid corners are a key growth lever for us, as we believe the hearing aid market is wellpoised for significant growth, particularly in France following the implementation of 100% Santé in
January 2021 and also that we are well-positioned to benefit from this growth as the hearing aid
business is complementary to and synergistic with our historical optical business and we already have
a significant footprint of hearing aid points of sale in our core markets. We believe there is significant
upside to putting hearing aid corners in our franchisees' existing optical stores, as the two businesses
are complementary and we believe that these hearing aid corners drive like-for-like growth in sales of
frames and lenses/glasses. Our model envisions franchisees operating their dedicated optical stores
alongside two to three corners. We believe this approach is a natural fit for many of our franchisees,
particularly for those who are dually-qualified as opticians and audiologists, as well as for those who
see a natural way to expand their existing competency to cover audiology as well as optical services.
Finally, we believe that using the same model in our hearing aid business as we do in our optical
business will generate economies of scale in the future and help us to generate favorable levels of
profitability.

**_Further penetrate the European market in border countries and continue to expand in other_**
**_international areas_**

We have a well-established and expanding presence in countries that are adjacent to our core markets
of France and Spain, having successfully expanded our Alain Afflelou banner into Belgium (1995),
Luxembourg (2002), Switzerland (2005) and Portugal (2008). We believe that these "border" markets
collectively represent millions of potential end-customers and thus present a significant potential growth
opportunity for us, as these are familiar markets to us where we already have a fairly mature base,
where we can roll-out the same operating model we use in France and Spain and where we benefit
from built-in brand awareness. We intend to further extend our European footprint in these border
countries (i.e. Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Portugal) by deepening our franchise network. In
both Belgium and Switzerland, we are mainly present in French-speaking regions and we are increasing
our presence in Flemish-speaking regions of Belgium and the German-speaking regions of Switzerland.

170


-----

In Portugal, we are currently reviewing our strategy to expand beyond our existing base. We
continuously evaluate potential targets for strategic acquisitions, particularly in such border countries.

We also believe there are opportunities in the Middle East, where we see room to grow, as well as in
Africa, where there is an increasing middle class, as well as a growing population with more disposable
income, and especially in African countries that have a historical link with France. We believe that our
franchise model adapts well to various geographies, languages and types of markets. Our international
roll-out expansion in those new geographies rests on limited costs and risk strategy, with a model
operating through master franchise agreements, where potential is limited.

**_Continue to deliver operating efficiencies at Group-level_**

We intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our network organization
by streamlining our administrative and overhead functions and controlling our cost base, for instance
by regrouping our various administrative locations in France at one site in Paris. In our Alain Afflelou
banner, we intend to continue evaluating the performance of our store network, with a view to optimizing
such performance. We will also continue to carefully monitor our directly-owned stores network, with a
long-term target of maintaining a limited directly-owned stores perimeter, while acting opportunistically
where we believe there is low-risk potential, in particular opportunities that are created by the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic on retail space. We plan to continue to leverage our directly-owned stores in
managing our wider network, operating flagship stores, and in negotiations with suppliers.

We also intend to continue our advertising efforts to support the development of our network, while
leveraging our economies of scale. In particular, we believe that the rapid growth of our hearing aid
banner will generate a benefit to the brand equity of the overall Alain Afflelou banner. In addition, we
intend to continue leveraging our long-standing relationships with suppliers to obtain the most favorable
commercial terms for our store network. More generally, the expansion of our network, together with
the implementation of dedicated central purchasing units, has reinforced our purchasing power and our
ability to negotiate discounts and rebates with suppliers. Savings generated from these discounts or
rebates are shared with franchisees. Finally, we believe that expanding in border countries and growing
our hearing aids business will help us increase profitability, due to both gains in communication margins
and the growth of exclusive products.

**OUR BUSINESS**

Our principal activity is acting as a franchisor, allowing our franchisees to trade under our brands and
banners. Pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreements that we enter into with each of our
franchisees, we authorize our franchisees to use our brands, grant them the right to distribute optical
products and/or hearing aids under one of our banners, allow them to use our commercial offerings and
provide them with a variety of tools, services and know-how. We allow our franchisees to deploy our
innovative commercial offers and develop publicity and communication campaigns to promote our
brands and drive traffic to their stores. The best practices that we develop in our directly-owned stores
are also shared with our franchisees. We have also put in place a comprehensive supply, purchase and
logistics system for our franchisees. Additionally, we sell optical products that bear the "Afflelou"
signature label, which are offered to franchisees as a means to extend their product range. The services
that we offer our franchisees as franchisor aim to develop, support and foster the business of our
franchisees. We believe that the services we offer to our franchisees allow them to develop their
business, increase their performance and offer consumers a better shopping experience while
continually reinforcing the image of our brand and banners. This role also allows us to increase footfall
to stores and assist in franchisee recruitment. The following sections present an overview of our
relationship with our franchisees and describe the various services that we provide to them. In addition
to our role as a franchisor, we also operate certain directly-owned stores.

**_Franchise model_**

_Overview_

Our franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who have entered into franchise agreements with us
to operate one or several optical and/or hearing aid points of sale. Franchisees trade under one or more
of our banners.

By partnering with us, our franchisees gain access to our proven franchise model, providing them with
(i) greater access to customers through increased brand awareness, our marketing and communication
strategy and attractive and affordable offers, (ii) access to our exclusive Afflelou-branded products, (iii)
favorably negotiated terms with suppliers through our central purchasing unit and (iv) support services

171


-----

throughout the lifecycle of the franchise, including store design and merchandising, financing and sales
force support and recruiting.

_Our franchise agreements_

The terms and conditions of our franchise agreements define the reciprocal roles and obligations of us
and our franchisees and reflect the particular requirements of each of our brands and banners as well
as the different jurisdictions in which we operate. Likewise, levels of remuneration paid to us from
franchisees vary from banner to banner and country to country.

Franchise agreements in our Alain Afflelou banner generally have an initial three-year term and are
automatically renewed two years in advance for an additional one-year period, unless the contract is
terminated during its initial period or during each such additional period, for a maximum period of ten
years. As a result of the renewal conditions of our franchise agreements, we generally have visibility of
approximately two years on the evolution of our franchise partnerships. We are working to import certain
key features from our Alain Afflelou franchise agreements into our Optical Discount franchise
agreements. Franchise agreements in our Optical Discount banner generally have a similar duration to
those in our Alain Afflelou banner.

Franchisees are generally granted exclusivity in a certain territory with respect to the banner or banners
they are operating under, and in return, they are subject to standard non-compete provisions. In order
to protect the integrity of the Alain Afflelou network, we only operate with franchisees who are
exclusively involved in the optical and hearing aids businesses under our banners (other than limited
arrangements with certain independent stores); franchisees are generally prohibited from carrying out
a franchise activity with any other group or franchise or distribution network during a period of one year
from the date of the end of the franchise agreement.

We receive a one-time entry fee per store with a lower fee charged for each additional store opened by
a franchisee. This entry fee varies according to negotiations with our franchisees and depends on
various factors, including, notably, the potential of the store and the exclusive area and the length of
the relationship with our franchisee. Additionally, pursuant to our standard franchise agreement,
franchisees pay a monthly standard franchise fee of 4.15% of their network sales (excluding VAT) for
the Alain Afflelou banner in France and 4.23% of their network sales (excluding VAT) for the Alain
Afflelou banner in Spain. The royalty fee is our fee for the award of a non-exclusive license to use our
brand, the relevant banner and trademarks according to the terms of the franchise agreement, as well
as the provision of various other franchisor services, in particular the know-how that we provide to the
franchisee during the course of the agreement. See "—Services that we provide as franchisor" for a
description of the services we provide to franchisees.

Additionally, as franchisor, we provide communications and marketing services as further described
under "—Advertising and communications to build strong brand awareness", for which the franchisees
compensate us. For European franchisees, the communications budget for each country is presented
by management and approved at the annual meeting of the relevant CNF (as defined in "—Franchisee
_representation") and is generally the same amount within a banner, with no negotiation except for_
franchisees outside of metropolitan areas. For non-European franchisees, the compensation for these
services is set in the franchise agreement and varies in amount depending on the market and our local
communications strategy. For example, communication fees are set at 7% of a franchisee's network
sales in the Alain Afflelou banner in France (including VAT) and 8.34% of a franchisee's network sales
for the Alain Afflelou banner in Spain(excluding VAT).

We may terminate a franchise agreement in a number of circumstances, in particular in cases of a
material failure by the franchisee to observe our commercial policy or where a franchisee closes its
store or is unable to maintain or renew the relevant lease, fails to make payments required under the
agreement or becomes insolvent. Additionally, we may terminate the contract upon the death or
incapacity of the franchisee or the loss of his or her license as an optician or audio prosthetist (as
applicable), or in certain other events, including the violation of the non-compete provision.

The franchisee may also terminate a franchise agreement without cause at the end of the initial threeyear period or during its extension periods, by notifying the franchisor within two calendar years
(whether successive or not), in which case the agreement would terminate at the start of the calendar
year that immediately follows the year in which the second notice was given. If a franchise agreement
is terminated due to a franchisee failing to meet its contractual obligations or at the franchisee's request
before the end of the current contractual period, the contract provides that we retain the right to receive
our annual royalties and communication fees provided for under the agreement until the end of the initial

172


-----

duration of the franchise agreement. In addition, franchisees are obligated to return banner signage
upon termination, in order to avoid any confusion for end-customers.

As franchisor and in accordance with our obligations under the franchise agreement, we have the
following obligations:

    - providing our franchisees the know-how, expertise and training necessary to operate their
business;

    - allowing franchisees to use our banners, brands and merchandizing as well as allowing
them to use our central listing and purchasing unit and our commercial offers; and

    - developing and implementing publicity campaigns and communications at our level.

As franchisee and in accordance with its obligations under the franchise agreement, the franchisee
must in particular respect the following obligations:

    - paying ongoing royalties as indicated above;

    - purchasing their products exclusively from suppliers listed by our central listing and
payment unit;

    - complying with certain requirements in terms of merchandizing and store layout, so that
brand identity is aligned and the same store concept is used throughout our networks;

    - implementing our commercial strategy and promoting our commercial offers;

    - contributing to communications and advertising expenses and submitting any local
advertising initiative for our approval;

    - purchasing samples of and displaying our branded products in their stores;

    - reporting sales levels on a monthly basis (franchisees may also report other performance
indicators, such as sales by product and total number of products sold);

    - providing us with a copy of their annual accounts;

    - granting us a right of first refusal in the event that they seek to sell their business or retire;

    - adhering to a non-compete clause prohibiting affiliation with a competing network, which
typically extends for one year after the termination of the franchise agreement;

    - adhering to certain confidentiality provisions; and

    - following the termination of the franchise agreement, ensuring that all manner of trade
goods and fixtures pertaining to our banners and brands, including our store concept,
furniture, display shelves and signage, are removed from the store.

_Franchisee representation_

Our relations with our franchisees are mainly structured around national franchisee commissions (each,
a "CNF") which we have set up in each of the European countries in which we carry out our activities.
The CNFs are responsible for collectively representing the franchisees in their relationship with us and
are also responsible for: (i) the representation of our franchisees in Europe; (ii) centralizing, simplifying
and organizing communications with the franchisor; and (iii) approving certain decisions, such as our
marketing plan, which is submitted annually for the approval of the relevant CNF. In France, the CNF
is composed of 15 members for a term of three years, representing a total population of approximately
350 franchisees. In Spain, the CNF is composed of 11 members, representing a total population of
approximately 172 franchisees. Members are elected by the franchisees in the jurisdiction covered by
such CNF. In Belgium, Portugal, Luxembourg and Switzerland, all franchisees are members of the CNF
due to the limited number of franchisees. See also "Regulation" for a summary of the regulatory
framework that applies to our relationship with franchisees.

_Franchisee profile_

We ask our franchisees to deliver the customer service and purchasing experience that customers
expect from our banners. Forming close, successful partnerships with franchisees based on mutual
commercial success is an essential component of our business model. The following presents a profile
of our franchisees.

173


-----

Optical

On average, Alain Afflelou franchisees in France operated 1.9 stores as of July 31, 2020. As of
July 31, 2020, Optical Discount franchisees operated 1.2 stores on average and franchisees in Spain
operated 1.5 stores as of July 31, 2020.

In the other European markets where we carry out our activities, our franchisees have a similar profile
to our franchisees in France and Spain. In certain non-European markets, the profiles of our franchisees
may differ from those common in Europe.

The average revenue (including VAT) per Alain Afflelou store for franchisees for the fiscal year ended
July 31, 2019 was €867,000 in France and €417,000 in Spain (2019 figures presented to reflect average
revenue in a fiscal year not impacted by COVID-19, as 2020 figures are not illustrative). For the market
generally, the average revenue per store combining all banners (including VAT and excluding online
sales) was €540,000 in France in 2019 and €189,000 in Spain in 2018. However, average revenue
(including VAT and excluding online sales) for independent retailers was €219,000 in France in 2019
and €83,000 in Spain in 2018 according to the CNF. We believe this performance is mainly the result
of: (i) the quality of service that our franchisees provide to customers; (ii) the strong recognition of the
Alain Afflelou brand and our banners; and (iii) the services that we provide to franchisees which support
and assist them in their operations. For further information about our competitive position in the
geographies where we compete, see "Industry".

Our ten largest franchisees (across all banners and jurisdictions) own and operate an average of ten
stores, representing 9.6% of network sales in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. None of them
operates more than 18 stores as of July 31, 2020. Thus, we believe that we are not dependent on any
one franchisee.

In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, 20 new franchisees representing 22 stores, joined our Alain
Afflelou banner in France, entering our network either through openings (four stores) or purchases of
existing stores (18 stores) from franchisees.

Hearing aids

As of July 31, 2020, our 69 hearing aid franchisees in France operated an average of 4.5 points of sale
(either dedicated stores or corners inside optical stores). For more information regarding our banners
and their presence in our main geographies, see "—Distribution channels".

**_Services that we provide as franchisor_**

As franchisor, we provide our franchisees, both before the opening of their store and throughout the
course of their operations, advice and support services. Our services as franchisor, the relationships
formed with franchisees and the interaction between us, our franchisees and end-customers are
intended to increase franchisees' sales. The following section describes the characteristics of our brand,
which is based in part on customer surveys performed by various institutions in France and Spain and
a study that we commissioned as well as a brief description of the know-how that we provide our
franchisees.

_Financing solutions for franchisees_

As part of our franchisor role, we offer different financing solutions for developing franchisees' activities:

  - _New store openings. Opening an optical product or hearing aid store requires capital. In an_
effort to attract a new generation of franchisees and accelerate the transition of certain of our
directly-owned stores into franchised stores, we piloted a financial support program. This
program, called "Project Adelante" ("PA"), began in Spain in 2013 and was extended to France
in 2016. In Spain, approximately 50 stores have benefitted from the PA program, and in France,
more than 30 PA transactions have already been completed. The aim of the program is to help
qualified opticians employed at our directly-owned stores transition into successful opticianentrepreneurs and thus, future franchisees. In Spain, we provide financial support to these
opticians by guaranteeing bank loans obtained from partner banks, which facilitates opticians'
access to financing, which is necessary at the start of their franchisee business. In France, we
help finance the new franchisee by purchasing convertible bonds issued by the new franchise
company, helping it obtain the equity cushion it needs to qualify for bank financing. As part of
"Project Adelante", potential and/or future franchisees are hired by us as managers of directlyowned stores in order to increase the potential and/or future franchisee's knowledge and
experience, before taking over a franchise store.

174


-----

  - _Working capital financing._ We have negotiated financial support for our franchisees with
consumer finance lender Cofidis, our partner with our NextYear financing solutions. Cofidis
makes available a working capital advance, for which we pay the interest, to allow the
franchisee to pay for signature label eyewear products after one year. In addition, we have put
in place several framework agreements with partner banks to finance refurbishment, store
design or working capital needs. These agreements allow our franchisees to access external
financing at preferential conditions compared to those they would receive from their usual
partners and be subject to less stringent requirements as a result of our support. These
agreements can also be used for temporary needs. For instance, more than 400 of our
franchisees benefitted from a €20,000 loan in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

  - _Assistance relating to relationships with banks and other service providers. In addition to_
advising and supporting our franchisees, we have selected a number of partner banks,
including BNPP, Crédit du Nord and CM-CIC, and service providers (such as accounting
networks, including KPMG, Fiducial and In Extenso), that are able to service our franchisee
network, and that have a close relationship with, and knowledge of, our network, in order to
facilitate franchisees' financial management.

  - _COVID-19 arrangements. As part of our franchisee management approach, we can, from time_
offer direct support to our franchisees, either through individual arrangements with franchisees
experiencing financial difficulties or through postponements of franchisee payments. For
example, since the beginning of the pandemic, the Group has taken various measures to
support the financial health of the store network, including by reducing monthly instalments in
March, April and May 2020 (for a total amount of more than €30 million) and through loans
granted by banks and guaranteed by the Group (for a total approximate amount of €15 million,
of which approximately 450 loans of €20,000 were granted by our partner in the NextYear offer
under the framework agreements described above). Where we offer payment deferrals, the
network team, together with the financial and the legal departments, creates reimbursement
plans and franchisees enter into agreements that govern and set out their commitments and
related guarantees. Thanks to strong sales recovery since June, and the loans described
above, almost all our franchisees were able to start repaying the postponed monthly instalment
amounts. The outstanding amounts on deferred payments of our franchisees were
approximately €12.6 million as of January 31, 2021, with repayment expected to be complete
before the end of the fiscal year ending July 31, 2021.

_Advertising and communications to build strong brand awareness_

Since our founding, we have developed significant know-how in terms of advertising and
communications. Our communications strategy focuses on promoting the reputation of our brands and
banners, as well as educating customers about our commercial offers and new products bearing our
own brands. Our commercial offers are relayed by television, our websites and apps, text message, email, social media, billboards, radio and print, through marketing campaigns or sponsorship
opportunities and by in-store signage.

Our multimedia advertising campaigns and communications strategy are intended to be memorable,
resonate with customers and inspire confidence in our opticians and audio prosthetists, while informing
customers of our commercial offers. These campaigns and communications also drive footfall to our
stores. Our communications efforts are carefully monitored with the assistance of advertising agencies,
notably through the analysis of our gross advertising expenses as compared to our competitors in our
main geographies and performance of our "share of voice" in various media.

We regularly assess our brand awareness in countries in which we have a significant market share,
using market studies we commission, such as OpinionWay for France in 2020 and prior years and
Belgium and Switzerland in 2018 and 2021 and Punto de Fuga for Spain in 2021 and prior years. We
use these market studies to better follow the results of our commercial offers and communication
campaigns. We also look at third-party consumer surveys (not conducted at our request), which we
regularly purchase from various companies specialized in our markets, such as Arcane and Gallileo in
France.

As shown below, Alain Afflelou ranks number one, either in spontaneous or assisted awareness in
France.

In Spain, Punto de Fuga ranked the Alain Afflelou banner as the leader in spontaneous brand
awareness in a survey conducted in January 2021 and fifth in assisted brand awareness for the same
year.

In Belgium, OpinionWay ranked the Alain Afflelou banner second in both assisted and spontaneous
brand awareness, with 86% assisted awareness, in Wallonia in a survey conducted in March 2021. The
majority of our stores in Belgium are located in this region.

In Switzerland, OpinionWay ranked the Alain Afflelou banner fourth in both assisted and spontaneous
brand awareness, with 82% assisted awareness, in a survey conducted in March 2021, among a
representative sample of the French speaking population.

Finally, as shown below, Alain Afflelou Acousticien in France ranks as a leader among hearing aid
specialists in France, either in spontaneous or assisted awareness.

We have also won a number of industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer
service provider of the year by the Elu service client de l'année (ESCDA) market survey, conducted by
Viseo Customer Insights, in France for five years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021), "Óptica
_del año" by Inma Stratmarketing for best optician in Spain in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, "best franchise_
in shopping centre" by the Asociación Española de Centros Comerciales in 2018 and "foreign franchise
with the best implantation in the Spanish market" by the Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018,
as well as for our television and video advertisements which customers easily recall. Some of our
franchisees also won the award of best hearing aid and optical franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020
by the Fédération des Réseaux Européens de Partenariats et de Franchise (IREF).

Other than national campaigns, our communications team also supervises local and temporary
advertising initiatives to promote the opening or reopening of stores. In such cases, advertising
expenses are financed by the relevant store, but our communications team assists the store in
managing the campaign. Prior to a franchised store opening for business, our development department
works closely with the franchisee to prepare a local communications and outreach plan to maximize
impact and visibility for their store's first trading days.

Our strong media presence allows our flagship brand, Alain Afflelou, to enjoy a strong reputation. This
brand is firmly embedded in customers' minds particularly in France, which we believe is considered to
be a preeminent retail destination for eyewear. Our strong brand image is built on several pillars,
including our history of five decades of innovation in terms of communications and commercial offers.
For more information regarding our track record of introducing new products and offers see "—Products
_and commercial offers". The strength and reputation of our brands are also premised on the quality of_
service that we provide our customers. We believe that the services we provide our franchisees as
franchisor enable franchisees to concentrate their efforts on their business which in turn allows

176


-----

customers to enjoy better services from franchisees and their employees, enhancing the reputation and
image of our brands and our networks.

_Procurement, purchasing and logistics solutions_

As franchisor, we provide our franchisees with many services related to procurement, purchasing and
logistics. These services generate franchisor revenue through fees charged to our suppliers, who in
turn benefit from access to our franchisees and store networks. We also earn revenue through the
resale of certain optical and hearing aid products by us to franchisees. Purchasing solutions refers
collectively to the following activities: (i) our central listing unit and payment unit; (ii) purchasing and
licensing; and (iii) trading. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, we generated 43.9% of our
revenue from our procurement activities for our franchisees.

Central listing and payment unit

As independent retailers, our franchisees are free to select products to sell in their stores, choosing
among the suppliers that are listed by our central listing and payment unit. Franchisees are free to
determine products' resale price. However, for optical products sold under our own brands, we set the
maximum price.

The central listing unit encompasses all listed suppliers and their products that are approved to be sold
in our store networks. We have a dedicated division which is responsible for compiling and updating
the list of suppliers and products. Among our listed suppliers are the main frame, lenses, contact lenses
and sunglasses manufacturers in the market, as described under "—Sourcing" and certain smaller
players who wish to be listed and meet our requirements. Stores in our networks may also suggest that
a particular supplier be listed.

The purchases made by our networks allow us to negotiate advantageous commercial terms with each
of our suppliers and enter into framework agreements with them on behalf of the stores in our networks,
thus creating significant economies of scale. Framework supplier agreements are renewed every year
and do not provide for volume commitments. Additionally, some suppliers that offer specific products
and services may, from time to time, be listed and take advantage of our central payment unit. Stores
in our network are required to purchase all products sold, such as frames, lenses, contact lenses and
other optical products in their optical stores, and hearing aid devices, batteries, and other hearing
products in their hearing aids points of sale exclusively from suppliers that are listed by our central
listing and payment unit.

We generally also serve as an intermediary to facilitate payment between our networks of stores and
our listed suppliers, simplifying relations between the two. The listing and payment process are the
following:

    - _Ordering. The relevant store/franchisee sends its order to the listed supplier pursuant to_
their own arrangements. The majority of orders are processed electronically.

    - _Delivery of goods/invoicing. The supplier delivers the goods ordered and sends the invoice_
to the store/franchisee.

    - _Summary statement. Each month, the supplier sends us a summary statement listing_
goods invoiced to each store/franchisee. We collect summary statements from all suppliers
and provide franchisees a monthly statement listing all invoices due to suppliers.

    - _Payment to suppliers. We pay suppliers net of discounts and listing fees, rebates in_
accordance with negotiations with the central listing unit and _del credere commissions_
billed as part of listing fees.

    - _Payment from stores. Stores/franchisees pay us amounts due to suppliers, net of discounts_
and rebates that we negotiate on their behalf.

We invoice listed suppliers for the following:

    - listing of supplier commissions;

    - centralization of franchisees' payment commissions (listing and centralization of payment
are generally two services combined in the central listing structure);

    - _del credere commissions, which correspond to the guarantee provided by the franchisor for_
the orders of the stores within our networks; and

    - early payment allowances in case of a cash purchase or an early payment made by us.

177


-----

Our invoice system is identical in France and Spain, except that the del credere commission is
less common in Spain, as some suppliers choose to bear the store's default risk. Similar arrangements
are in place in Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland, allowing franchisees in countries where our
presence is less developed to benefit from the same services as those provided to our historical
locations and use suppliers that can sell to stores in such countries. Similar arrangements have also
been put in place for the Optical Discount and Alain Afflelou Acousticien networks. Franchisees in nonEuropean jurisdictions are also able to access these listing services and receive support from our
sourcing and supply chain team.

Purchasing and licensing

In order to offer franchisees better prices, mainly on lenses and contact lenses, we aggregate purchases
by leveraging the size of our store networks, generating significant economies of scale. As of July 31,
2020, corrective lenses, frames, contact lenses and care solution and sunglasses represented,
respectively, 55.5%, 22.5%, 14.8% and 7.3% of franchisees' purchases through our central purchasing
unit. As a result, franchisees are able to benefit from discounts and rebates we negotiate with suppliers
when they make purchasers through our central purchasing units, of which we retain a share. We also
make available to stores in our networks our own-brand lenses and contact lenses, which are lenses
and contact lenses manufactured by third parties that are among the largest in the industry (such as
Hoya, Coopervision or subsidiaries of the Essilor-Luxottica group) and are distributed by us. We charge
manufacturers of our own-brand lenses and contact lenses a licensing fee for use of our brand names,
such as Éphémère or Égérie. Such licensing fees are calculated as a percentage of the supplier's sales
to stores in our networks.

Trading

Our trading activity acts as a supplier by which we resell exclusive or own-brand products within our
own networks. This activity mainly involves frames and sunglasses that we sell under our own brands.
We directly sell exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in our networks either through logistics
providers or directly. Our exclusive frames and sunglasses consist of (i) signature label frames and
sunglasses bearing the "Afflelou" signature (currently under two main collections: the Tchin Tchin
collection, which is mainly dedicated to our multi-possession offer of "buy one get an additional or two
additional pairs of glasses for one euro more" and our innovative Magic collection of frames and clips);
(ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses; and (iii) exclusive collections. As part of our trading
activities, we retain a margin on the resale of exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in our network.
Finally, trading activities can be an entry point for new countries by allowing us to test consumers'
reactions to our own branded products and our other product lines. For more information about our
exclusive and own-brand products, see "—Products and commercial offers—Products" and "—
_Sourcing, branding and manufacturing—Sourcing". During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, our_
license purchasing and trading activities as well all of our purchase solutions for supplying our
franchisees totaled €113.0 million, i.e., 16.1% of network sales.

_Support services_

Overview

We have been operating for five decades and have gained significant experience in managing our
distribution networks, allowing us to master all aspects of our role as a franchisor and the management
of our directly-owned stores. When a new franchisee signs a franchise agreement with us, a long-term
partnership is formed, involving the transfer of knowledge, monitoring, sharing and refining of best
practices. This section details the know-how that we provide and continue to expand, hone and update,
based on everyday interactions with our franchisees and the realities of their business needs. For a
description of the IT solutions that we provide to our franchisees see "—Information technology".

Store location planning

Store location planning refers to a range of services and value-added tools that we employ to assist
existing and incoming franchisees determine where to place their stores, which is often the most
important consideration for the health of their businesses. As the largest optical product franchisor in
France, we have knowledge and experience that allows us to knowledgeably advise franchisees on
store locations using data that we have compiled based on information received from each of the stores
in our networks in the past decades. Our target catchment areas are medium- to large-sized urban
communities. Pursuant to our contractual arrangements, every franchised store location must be
approved by us prior to opening its doors. We are also able to analyze store potential based on, among

178


-----

other things, the proximity of competitors. We can also connect potential franchisees with local
contractors, helping them evaluate offers for refurbishment and outfitting and arrange store visits to
existing stores in similar locations. In addition, our analyses of our existing stores' network sales,
including information gathered from our customer relationship management system, provide insights
that enable our franchisee sales and network development teams to identify favorable whitespace in
areas where we operate in Europe. Following such analysis, our development team can actively seek
out prospective franchisees in such areas where we believe they are more likely to be successful,
further bolstering the network's presence in these areas.

Store design

Alain Afflelou banner stores are known for their distinctive color schemes, elegant displays and intuitive
retail store layout. We have developed a range of products and services for franchisees in order to
present customers a consistent, high-quality shopping experience across all our store networks and
maintain brand integrity. We provide comprehensive store design and layout solutions, including selling
distinctive retail furniture and wall display pieces, which creates a similar welcoming feel in each of our
stores. To maintain this, we have obtained design protection from the relevant authorities for certain of
our custom-designed retail furniture to ensure that they are adequately protected. Our current store
design is called "Champs Elysées", after our flagship store, which we recently refurbished under this
new concept.

Training and development

We provide extensive training for franchisees and their employees, to enable them to meet the high
standards that our customers expect of our stores. As part of the initial training provided to franchisees,
we have a program that familiarizes franchisees with our business model and acquaints them with the
representatives and regional managers who will be their primary contacts. Initial training includes
programs covering, among other things, advertising and local communications, inventory management
and planning and using our order fulfillment system. Our "Alain Afflelou Academy" provides training
courses for franchisees and their employees in France and was expanded to Spain through "Alain
Afflelou Academia de Vuelo" in April 2014. In April 2016, our training programs became available online.
The training sessions that we offer cover, in particular, sales techniques for different optical products
such as sunglasses and children's glasses, effective store and personnel management as well as
commercial strategies.

Certification

Certifications granted by independent providers have become an important commercial consideration
for consumers, as a symbol of professionalism and integrity, as well as for the process of joining closed
networks in France. We have mobilized to assist and guide our franchisees in obtaining certifications in
order to further enhance our standing among customers. In 2014, we set up a hotline to assist
franchisees with the documentation required to obtain Afnor and Veritas certifications. In addition,
regional managers maintain and update lists of franchisees that have obtained such certifications in
order to analyze the resulting benefits and impact of such certifications. In order to help our franchisees
navigate this process, we provide our franchisees with an information guide and place them in contact
with the company France Certification to attend training sessions on these certifications.

We provide support for obtaining AFNOR-REF 230 (Service Agreement – Optical Quality) certification
to our and franchised stores. AFNOR-REF 230 certification aims to improve the quality of customer
service and satisfaction, in particular by: (i) guaranteeing care from a trained and educated professional,
working in close collaboration with an ophthalmologist; (ii) offering products at a good price/quality ratio
due to a rigorous selection process of lenses and frames suppliers; (iii) offering the option for no upfront
costs, with costs being paid by the public health system and the OCAMs; and (iv) offering a follow-up
service to monitor changes in the customer's prescription during its validity.

Similarly, we provide support for obtaining VeriSelect Quality Optician Services to all of our directlyowned stores and franchised stores. VeriSelect Quality Optician Services are issued by the Veritas
Certificate Bureau and recognized by OCAMs and care networks. The goal of this certification is to
guarantee consumers that certified stores provide reliable service, are professional and attentive in
particular by: (i) respecting clear and legible commitments made to consumers; (ii) guaranteeing a welladapted space by identified and competent professionals; (iii) providing explanations in terms of
equipment choice; (iv) providing uniform invoices including the consumer's healthcare data; and
(v) providing personalized and confidential service and follow-up in terms of the quality of service.

Assisting with access to care networks in France

Since 2014, we have provided our franchisees with information and assistance in qualifying for and
joining the French care networks. We feel that membership in a care network enables franchisees to
attract a larger number of customers. However, joining a care network can be a costly and burdensome
process involving preparation of submissions to tenders and related complex documentation. In 2015,
we institutionalized our care network support activity. Currently, our care networks manager assists our
opticians and audio prosthetists in preparing and submitting bids by providing guidelines, bespoke
advice via a hotline and preparing standardized support documentation. For example, when a care
network issues requests for proposals as part of a tender process, our care networks manager analyzes
the selection criteria and provides a summary to our franchisees and directly-owned store managers.
Certain training and certification costs associated with this initiative are invoiced to the franchisees. As
a result of various efforts to support franchisees, as of July 31, 2020, 82% and 67% of the stores under
the Alain Afflelou banner in France are part of one and two or more care networks, respectively. For
more information about care networks and a description of care networks, see "Regulation—France—
_Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system"._

Management and operational support

If a franchisee encounters difficulties within the scope of their operations, we also provide a certain
number of assistance and advice services. In 2014, we launched a campaign called "Elite" that assisted
and helped franchisees whose results were below expectations. This initiative involved a full range of
management and operational support, including in respect of merchandising, product range, training,
cash management, store refurbishment and inventory optimization. Monthly follow-ups were arranged
in order to quickly monitor progress, identify new developments and respond accordingly. This program
reinforced our relationships with our franchisees and harmonized customer service and customers'
shopping experience across our networks. We believe that this program was successful in improving
the performance of certain stores which, without this support, likely would have closed. In 2021, we
launched a new Elite campaign, covering approximately 15 stores in France, with the aim of providing
support to franchisees in the operational management of their stores, including inventory management,
purchasing strategy and offer positioning.

Legal

As part of operating a store, franchisees may encounter legal problems related to their optician or audio
prosthetist business or for example, labor law difficulties. In order to respond to these specific labor law
difficulties, we provide legal support services to our franchisees.

Human resources and sales force incentives

Recruiting, retaining and rewarding qualified staff is an important component that underpins our
success. We operate a central clearinghouse for recruitment of trained and newly-graduated opticians
and audio prosthetists from recognized institutions. Franchisees can also utilize this platform for their
recruiting needs. In April 2016, we created "Club Afflelou" in France, to help organize business activities
which is open to franchisees, employees of franchisees and employees of our directly-owned stores.
This program allowed members to accumulate points which can be exchanged for a large range of gifts.
Since the Loi Anti-cadeaux, which prevents third party companies, like suppliers of optical businesses,
from promoting their products through personal benefits, became applicable to us in October 2020, we
have eliminated this activity.

Consumer financing solutions

Finally, we have negotiated with consumer finance lenders (in particular Cofidis) to provide payment
facilities to customers who purchase products through our NextYear commercial offers. NextYear
enables customers of our networks to pay for their eyeglasses, contact lenses or hearing aid products,
generally in twelve equal monthly payments without interest or other charges. We serve as an
intermediary between consumers and these finance lenders and do not incur any credit risk as part of
this program.

**DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS**

We manage an extensive store network across 18 countries as of January 31, 2021, primarily in France
and Spain. As of January 31, 2021, our networks comprised 958 stores in France (including 90 hearing
aid stores and 221 hearing aid corners), 336 stores in Spain (including 59 hearing aid points of sale)
and 141 stores in Other countries. The graphic below shows the evolution of our store networks across

180


-----

all geographies and including all Alain Afflelou and Optical Discount banner stores and hearing aid
stores from July 31, 2016 to January 31, 2021.

_Source: Group information._

The majority of our stores are franchises though, in key European markets such as France and Spain,
we also operate certain directly-owned stores in order to support the breadth of our networks and anchor
our presence at strategic locations. For more information about sales by geographical area for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and for the six months ended January 31, 2021, see
"Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Main factors
_affecting our results—Expansion of store network"._

In order to optimize our performance and attract the greatest number of customers to our networks of
stores, we have organized our optical banners to appeal to two groups of customers: one that is
attracted by a strong brand name, high-quality commercial offers and products and technological
innovations, which we consider to be our premium offering, and the other for whom price constitutes
the main purchasing criterion.

**_Store networks_**

_Generalist activity_

Alain Afflelou is our most established banner. The founding of this banner helped create the modern
optical retail sector in Europe by focusing on customer needs and affordability. As of January 31, 2021,
we had a total of 1,318 Alain Afflelou stores, of which 768 were optical product stores located in France,
333 were optical product stores located in Spain and 124 were optical product stores located in Other
countries and 93 were hearing aid stores (not including 277 corners inside optical stores). As of January
31, 2021, our networks included 1,225 Alain Afflelou optical banner stores, 93 hearing aid stores and
117 Optical Discount stores. We operate three different types of stores: downtown stores, stores located
in shopping malls and stores located in retail parks.

The potential €14,000 increase in sales illustrates the potential increase in sales of our stores without
hearing aid corners if the latter were to include hearing aid corners in the future and is based on the
average outperformance of our stores with hearing aid corners compared with stores without them,
without adjusting for other factors.
Optical - France

In France, as of January 31, 2021, our networks comprised 768 Alain Afflelou optical stores. In France,
our Alain Afflelou banner stores are concentrated in and around medium- and large-size urban areas.
We are also present in the main French overseas departments and territories. In recent years, we have
emphasized the opening of franchised stores outside of city centers, responding to changing consumer
preferences. Stores situated in shopping malls or in retail parks offer more floor space with larger
parking facilities, lower rents and generally lower refurbishment costs. Furthermore, Sunday trading and
longer opening hours are possible in malls and retail parks, whereas they are generally not possible in
city centers outside of certain high traffic areas in larger cities.

Our directly-owned stores in France are part of our strategic decision to support our franchisees and
our brand, including through operating city center and shopping mall stores for flagship purposes in and
around Paris and other key strategic locations, as well as maintaining a group of stores for testing new
offers and instituting best practices. Finally, certain directly-owned stores comprise former franchised
stores that had encountered difficulties and have been transitioned to direct ownership in order to
address operational issues before securing a new franchisee operator. See "—Distribution channels—
_Development and management of our store networks" for more information._

In June 2016, we began offering new and existing franchisees the opportunity to create a pure play
sunglasses corner within their store, called "Afflelou Sun", of which there were 155 locations in France
as of January 31, 2021. The Afflelou Sun banner is intended to respond to the growing demand for
prescription sunglasses, as a fashion accessory and for ultraviolet and solar protection.

Optical - Spain

In Spain, as of January 31, 2021, our networks comprised 333 Alain Afflelou optical stores. In
comparison, our network in Spain consisted of 122 stores as of July 31, 2006 and 263 stores as of July
31, 2011. Our Alain Afflelou banner stores in Spain are concentrated in the Madrid region and on the
eastern coast in the regions of Catalonia and Valencia, as well as in certain northern regions such as
Galicia. Our directly-owned store network in Spain (which is proportionally larger than our directlyowned store network in France) consists of: (i) flagship stores located in city centers and shopping
malls, these stores allow the banner to anchor our presence in major urban areas; (ii) stores to test new
business initiatives, product concepts and innovations and identify best practices; and (iii) a group of
certain former franchised stores that resulted from repurchases of such stores from former franchisees
who retired or withdrew from the business during the economic crisis from 2009 to 2013. In particular
as a result of our financial support program called "Project Adelante", we intend to shift a large portion
of such stores to franchisees.

Optical - Other countries

  - In Belgium and Luxembourg, as of January 31, 2021, we had 51 Alain Afflelou banner
franchised stores. In Belgium, these stores are mainly located in Wallonia, the francophone
region of Belgium, though in recent years, we have developed our activity in Flanders. We do
not directly own any stores in Belgium or Luxembourg.

  - In Portugal, as of January 31, 2021, we had 25 Alain Afflelou banner stores, primarily located
in the country's main urban areas such as Lisbon, Setúbal, Porto, Braga and Faro, of which 19
were franchised stores and six were directly-owned.

  - In Switzerland, as of January 31, 2021, we had 18 Alain Afflelou banner franchised stores. We
do not directly own any stores in Switzerland.

We are also present through franchisees or master franchise agreements in Other countries in Africa,
the Middle East, Asia and South America. Afflelou-Paris, which focuses on our French beginnings and
fashion know-how, is the generalist banner that we intend to use for our international development in
non-French speaking countries.

Hearing aids - Alain Afflelou Acousticien

Our founder, Mr. Alain Afflelou, is best known as an optician. However, he is also a trained audio
prosthetist. After observing that the hearing aid market did not feature a player that combined
technological innovation with attractive commercial offers, we launched the Alain Afflelou Acousticien
brand, which built on the reputation of the Alain Afflelou brand, the trust that customers placed in this
brand and changing commercial offers we have historically offered. Alain Afflelou Acousticien also
benefits from the use of the Alain Afflelou banner, known on the optical products markets for its products
and innovative commercial offers. In July 2013, the Afflelou family (through their interest in Holding AA
& Fils) and certain other of our indirect shareholders established LSFA in order to separate the networks
of hearing aid product retail stores. On July 31, 2016, we acquired 100% of LSFA and, as part of the
transaction, completed the integration of the hearing aid franchise activity under the Alain Afflelou
Acousticien banner.

As of January 31, 2021, the Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner comprised 370 points of sale (including
221 corners inside Alain Afflelou optical stores and 90 stores in France), of which 59 were points of sale
in Spain. As a comparison, at July 31, 2016, we had 177 hearing aid points of sale (of which 46 were
stores in France, 101 were corners in France and 30 were points of sale in Spain). In Spain, in light of
the difficulties encountered by our master franchise partner in rolling out our hearing aid network in
Spain, we terminated this master franchise agreement amicably in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019,
with no compensation or penalties for either party. We then decided to roll out the network by ourselves,
and reached a level of 59 points of sale (56 corners and three stores) as of January 31, 2021. The chart
below shows the evolution of the number of points of sale in our hearing aid network in France and
Spain between July 31, 2016 and January 31, 2021.

_Source: Group information._

In the six months ended January 31, 2021, approximately 95.8% of our network sales of our hearing
aid business was generated in France, accounting for €22.8 million of sales for the six months ended
January 31, 2021. The majority of our points of sale are corners hosted in Alain Afflelou optical stores.
We believe that hearing aid corners allow optical product consumers to discover our hearing aid
products and are likely to generate significant clientele for audio prosthetist franchisees. Likewise, we
believe that the addition of a hearing aid corner to an optical store is likely to create additional sales for
the optician. For example, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the optical product sales of Alain
Afflelou stores in France with a hearing aid corner outperformed the rest of the optical Alain Afflelou
French network at a rate of 1.9% on a like-for-like basis. We intend to continue to focus on synergies of
our two businesses, including combined offers to end customers.

_Discount activity_

We purchased the company operating stores under the banner Optical Discount in July 2015 to increase
our presence in the discount activity of the optical product market. Optical Discount was founded in
1995 and positioned itself in the discount activity, specifically focused on offering leading brands such
as Gucci, Ray Ban, Armani, Givenchy, Hugo Boss, Diesel, Roberto Cavalli and Police at competitive
prices. The Optical Discount banner targets price-sensitive customers looking to enjoy the same leading
brand name products at a lower price.

Optical Discount's strategy is to provide customers leading brand optical products that they are able to
find at other retailers, at an attractive price. To do this, Optical Discount mainly purchases prior years'
collections from leading brand manufacturers and also provides them with a clearance solution.

184


-----

We believe that one of the features that draws customers to Optical Discount stores is the option to
purchase a "Club OD" card for €10, which gives access to discounts on a wide variety of products. The
"Club OD" card is valid for purchases in store and online. Optical Discount's price tags display the lower
"Club OD" price as well as a suggested prevailing retail price for the same item so that customers are
able to easily quantify their savings.

Moreover, Optical Discount uses the same commercial strategy as certain hard discount stores,
refunding twice the difference to any customer that finds the same product for a lower price at another
location. Furthermore, each purchase with the "Club OD" card accrues points which the customer can
use for gifts such as cinema tickets, electronics and gift certificates with other merchants.

In 2019, we began a review of our franchisee portfolio at Optical Discount, with the aim of retaining
partners more aligned with the wider Group's requirements in terms of quality of payment, commercial
practices, store format and more generally that shares our strategy and growth plans for the banner. As
a consequence, our Optical Discount perimeter has been significantly reduced and we intend in the
future to retain only partners that meet such requirements. As of January 31, 2021, our Optical Discount
network was composed of 100 stores in France and 17 stores in Other countries, following a significant
restructuring in order to have a network of stores that is aligned to our store formats and concepts and
agreement with franchisees as to the commercial practices of the banner.

**_Development and management of our store networks_**

_Franchised stores_

Our franchisees independently operate one or several stores under one or more of our banners. As
franchisor, we continuously interact with franchisees in order to promote their activity and increase their
performance. We have put in place at the local level an internal surveillance and communications
system with our franchisees, allowing us to maintain and promote brand integrity, and gather sufficient
information about our franchisees' businesses.

A regional network manager works with franchisees at the regional level of each geographic zone and
across all our banners. Regional network managers in France and Spain organize training and
exchange initiatives with franchisees and visits of model directly-owned stores. These initiatives enable
us to share the most up-to-date know-how and expertise with our franchisees in terms of store layout,
merchandizing, best commercial practices and sales techniques. Regional network managers are
employed by us and act as intermediaries between our management and franchisees. In smaller
markets, regional network managers are generally responsible for an entire market, grouping together
several countries, depending on the number of stores that we maintain in a given market or region.

We have implemented an internal monthly scoring system for each store and franchisee, which enables
us to process data collected from franchisees, our central listing and payment units, our central
purchasing units and suppliers. In addition, our "Alain Afflelou Academy" and "Alain Afflelou Academia
de Vuelo" also provide additional levers to gauge franchisee engagement, the success of our latest
commercial offers and franchisees' commitment to the relevant banner. Our scoring system evaluates
various aspects of our relationships with franchisees, such as purchases, revenue, implementation of
our commercial strategy, sales of exclusive products, relationship quality and status of payments. As a
result, we are able to identify low performers among our franchisees, and work with them towards
improving their performance. Our central management determines the goals and analyzes franchisees'
results. Regional network managers regularly contact our central management and oversee various
activities, such as the communications, franchisee network development, financial management or the
logistics departments, allowing them to improve uniformity of practices and provide data for all our store
networks.

_Developing networks and recruiting new franchisees_

Europe

In Europe, our strategy for developing franchise networks concentrates on maintaining robust and
dynamic networks of optical franchisee-entrepreneurs and continuing to build a growing audio
prosthetist-entrepreneur network for our hearing aids business. As of January 31, 2021, we operated
our hearing aid business mainly in France and Spain. We have begun to expand this business to
Belgium and Switzerland, but it is still at an early stage. Our franchise development team is responsible
for increasing the number of franchised stores and uses the following methods: (i) recruiting through
specialized press, at trade shows and at events organized at optician and audio prosthetist training
schools; (ii) targeted recruitment of independent retailers and franchisees trading under other banners

185


-----

at locations that have been identified as important zones for us; and (iii) a multi-banner, multistore and
multidiscipline strategy. In addition, our regional network managers often work closely with our
franchisee development team to identify suitable franchisees that could potentially expand their activity
and operate a store under our discount banner. Additionally, we provide introduction services to help
connect opticians with audio prosthetists to encourage the introduction of hearing aid corners which
can yield increased footfall for both businesses. For a summary of the regulations applicable to us in
connection with sales of franchisees in France see "Regulation". Outside our core markets of France
and Spain, our strategy is to further extend our European footprint in countries in which we are already
a national player (mainly BeLux (51 stores), Switzerland (18 stores) and Portugal (25 stores)) to become
a leader in those markets by deepening our franchise network and exploiting opportunities for
consolidation, given the high level of fragmentation of these markets. In Belgium, we intend to
accelerate the development of both our Alain Afflelou and Optical Discount banners. In both Belgium
and Switzerland, we are mainly present in French-speaking regions, but we are increasing our presence
in Flemish-speaking regions of Belgium and recently opened the first store in a mixed French and
German-speaking region of Switzerland.

Outside of Europe

Internationally, we seek franchise networks in certain markets where we believe demand would be high
enough and that stores would be able to attract customers. Historically we have expanded in countries
where there has been a strong connection to French culture, entering into contracts with local
entrepreneurs who had an awareness of and affinity for our brand and value proposition. We perform
due diligence on prospective international franchisees to maintain brand quality and determine whether
the franchisee would be suitable to implement our commercial offers and preserve the image of the
brand and banner. Our international rollout strategy to penetrate new geographies rests on three pillars
that reduce the risk we take on when we expand into new geographies: (i) we first enter a new market
through wholesale activities to test the appetite for our branded products, while limiting our exposure
and investment risk, (ii) if this first phase is successful, we replicate our proven franchise model, with
limited capital expenditure and execution risk and (iii) we then expand our store network in the new
market, using our proven business strategy. In such countries, we generally try to operate with partners
that are already active in the optical business, ideally that are already managing several optical stores.
In such cases, such as in Kuwait, we may operate under a master-franchise agreement.

_Directly-owned stores_

Our core business is our franchisor activity. To support our franchisor role, we also directly operate a
portion of our networks of stores. At January 31, 2021, we operated 77 directly-owned stores in France,
77 directly-owned stores in Spain, and six directly-owned stores in Other countries (in Portugal). For
the six months ended January 31, 2021, directly-owned stores generated 28.0% of our total revenue
and 12.1% of our network sales. Our directly-owned stores operate under the same legal framework as
franchised stores, particularly through the intermediary of an intra-group franchise agreement. We
invoice our subsidiaries operating directly-owned stores for the same type of fees that we receive from
franchisees.

Objectives

We believe that operating directly-owned stores is a fundamental component of our global franchisor
strategy in that it allows us to better manage our networks. Our operating strategy regarding directlyowned stores rests on four pillars:

    - Maintain control of our flagship stores and anchor our banners in key symbolic and strategic
locations. In order to maintain, increase and promote the brand equity of our banners, we
believe we must be present at certain highly visible locations. Between ten to 20 stores are
located in symbolic locations such as the Champs-Elysées or La Défense in Paris, Gran
Via in Madrid and the Graça neighborhood in Lisbon. These stores are located in big cities
and tend to be on the more well-known shopping boulevards that are frequented by
domestic and international tourists. Controlling these stores directly allows us to utilize them
as walk-in advertisements and analyze customer's behavior and their experience. In certain
instances, such as the Champs-Elysées, rent and refurbishment costs of such stores are
too high for a franchisee.

    - Test and refine new commercial offers and establish best practices. Continuous
commercial innovation and retail best practices have assisted us in developing networks of
leading optical and hearing aid retailers in the countries where we operate. The stores in

186


-----

this category comprise between 50 to 100 stores, primarily in large urban areas and
shopping malls with strong visibility where we test and adapt our commercial offers. Such
stores serve as models for our entire network in terms of testing new commercial initiatives
before rolling them out to the full network and establishing operational and retail best
practices. Current and prospective franchisees are frequently invited to visit such stores as
part of training. Our Alain Afflelou Acousticien corners, the Afflelou Sun corners, the new
software for managing points of sale, sales force incentives, supply chain monitoring and
consumer data analytics tools are initiatives that were initially developed and tested in our
directly-owned stores.

    - Perform network management and buttress our expansion strategy in strategic areas. In
order to efficiently manage and develop our networks, we may temporarily acquire certain
franchised stores, and subsequently transition such store to a new franchisee in the short
to mid-term. The reasons for opening or assuming the direct management of a franchised
store include, among others, the need to ensure that we do not lose a particular site in case
of the retirement of a franchisee, material disagreement with a franchisee regarding
commercial policy or the need to turn around an underperforming store. Such stores can
be operated for a time as directly-owned stores before transitioning to franchisee
ownership, which sometimes involves assistance with financing by us. This "buy and sell
strategy" is held on behalf of the franchisor, to manage the whole network.

    - Leverage purchasing power. Our directly-owned stores structure enables us, in some
cases, to negotiate conditions for the whole network, as we are able to commit to
comparatively large purchase volumes.

Our strategy is to reduce our directly-owned stores portfolio. However, we intend to retain the directlyowned stores corresponding to the flagship and key strategic locations as well as those stores for testing
commercial, operational and logistics initiatives. Our long-term target for our directly-owned store
networks is to operate 100 to 150 directly-owned stores in the areas where we already operate.

Leasehold arrangements

Substantially all of our directly-owned stores are subject to commercial leaseholds. The following
provides a brief description of our leasehold arrangements in France and Spain, where the majority of
our directly-owned stores are situated.

French commercial leases generally have a minimum initial duration of nine years, but rarely exceed
twelve years. The lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease at the conclusion of each threeyear period. The lessor may only terminate the lease at the conclusion of each three-year period in
certain limited circumstances. At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to a
renewal. If the lessor refuses such renewal, the lessor will be required to compensate the lessee, unless
the lessor can show good cause. Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take
no action to renew or to terminate the lease, the original lease will be automatically renewed until a
notice of termination is served by either the lessee or the lessor. An automatically renewed lease may
be terminated at any time by either the lessee or the lessor providing that six months' prior notice is
given.

The parties are free to determine the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the
property at the signing of the contract. The rent may be fixed, variable or composed of a fixed portion
and a variable portion. Generally, the lease contains an annual rent indexation clause. The agreed
index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or to the purpose of
the lease. Alternatively, parties can choose the Commercial Rent Index (ILC) (indice des loyers
_commerciaux) or the Index Applicable to Leases of the Service Sector (ILAT) (indice des loyers des_
_activités tertiaries), both published by_ _l'Institut national de la statistique des études économiques_
(INSEE), the French public statistics institute.

In Spain, although the legal framework for commercial leases is less strict (i.e., commercial leases are
not subject to a specific legal framework), commercial leases are identical to those in France. However,
rent is often calculated as a percentage of turnover with a minimum lease amount being determined by
the parties.

**_Products and commercial offers_**

_Products_

Our philosophy and our added value, are premised on the idea that the customer can appreciate the
extent of our product offering and highlight the price-quality ratio of our products. These factors are
essential components of our model. This same philosophy inspired Mr. Alain Afflelou when he created
Alain Afflelou Acousticien, which relies on the main characteristics of price, choice and accessibility.

We offer Alain Afflelou and Optical Discount franchisees a range of refined and affordable optical
products such as prescription glasses, ready readers, sunglasses and contact lenses. We also provide
a range of hearing aid products for our Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner franchisees.

Our goal is to provide a product range that exceeds the choice offered by our competitors. Each of our
banners has a slightly different product range. For example, Alain Afflelou stores have the largest range
with a certain number of luxury brands, but also midmarket brands and signature label collections.
Optical products offered under our own brands include both ophthalmic frames and sunglasses, contact
lenses from the leading market players and other accessories. We do negotiate purchasing terms on
behalf of our networks, such as discounts and rebates which allows us to order, including through our
procurement, larger quantities and enjoy advantageous conditions.

The following presents a brief description of the type of products that we list in our central listing and
purchasing unit.

_Frames and sunglasses_

Products that we sell under our own labels

Since 2014, we have supervised and sub-contracted the production of eyewear collections featuring
the "Afflelou" signature. These optical products allow us to expand the product offer in our stores and
demonstrate our innovative capacity to customers while also providing franchisees and directly-owned
stores with attractive margins on these products. In the countries where we are present, signature label
products are only available at Alain Afflelou stores.

The products that we market under our own brands are specifically designed to be fashion-forward yet
affordable, and are compatible with the economic model of our Tchin Tchin commercial offer (a second
pair of our signature label eyeglasses for €1.00). According to a survey on brand awareness in frames,
the products that we market under our own brands are among the most well-known frame brands in
France, with a strong awareness among both women and men. The products that we market under our
own brands rank second in unaided brand awareness after Ray-Ban but before such frame brands as
Dior, Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana for women and Krys, Lacoste and Optic2000 for men according to
a survey of 825 respondents in France. The products that we market under our own brands are
positioned in the middle market and appeal to customers seeking a brand name who may also be
attracted to our multi-possession proposal that the Tchin Tchin offer allows (second pair of eyeglasses
for €1.00). For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, the products that we market under our own brands
represented approximately 46% in value of frames sold within our Alain Afflelou banner. Past years
have been marked by the success of our Smart Tonic (renamed Magic) collection, a collection of frames
with magnetic clips for a variety of purposes, including sun protection, blue-light filtering and night
driving. As such, our own brand is not only using banner awareness to promote its mid-range price
offer, but also ranks us among innovative brands for our own private labels. As of January 31, 2021,
approximately 1.0 million Magic frames and approximately 2.2 million Magic clips have been sold since
the launch of the collection in 2017.

Other brands and third-party names

As part of these offers, we negotiate the exclusive right to distribute ophthalmic frames and sunglasses
collections from third-party brands. These ophthalmic frames and sunglasses are designed and
produced by third-parties and are exclusively distributed across the networks of Alain Afflelou banner
stores. For more information about our suppliers, see "—Sourcing, branding and manufacturing—
_Sourcing". We also negotiate licenses for the design, product and marketing of ophthalmic frames and_
sunglasses. We select these products, subcontract their manufacturing pursuant to our specifications
and market them under the brands for which we have obtained a license.

188


-----

Third-party manufacturers' products

Our networks offer a large range of products manufactured by leading producers of optical products.
Through our central listing and payment unit, we allow the stores in our networks to access almost all
optical products available on the market.

_Lenses and contact lenses_

Proprietary products

We have been marketing our own products under our own brands (Éphémère since 2002, Protect since
2006 and Égérie since 2011) and exclusive products that have been licensed by us to certain thirdparty suppliers. These exclusive products, which cannot be found outside of our stores, provide
franchisees with a competitive advantage by leveraging our advertising and communications to increase
customer interest in our offering. Own-brand lenses and contact lenses are lenses and contact lenses
distributed by us through our central purchasing units or by one of our suppliers in the context of a
commercial offer. Manufacturers that we select to produce these exclusive products are generally
leading industry operators, such as Hoya or subsidiaries of Essilor-Luxottica in respect of lenses and
Coopervision and Safilens in respect of contact lenses. They are selected for the quality of their
products, as well as for the logistics services they provide. When distributing own-brand lenses and
contact lenses, we invoice licensing fees to suppliers. Such licensing fees are calculated as a
percentage of the supplier's sales to franchisees and directly-owned stores.

Other products

We also offer a range of third-party lenses and contact lenses from large suppliers in particular lenses
from Essilor-Luxottica, Carl Zeiss and Seiko and contact lenses from Bausch & Lomb, Alcon and
Johnson & Johnson.

_Commercial offers and marketing strategy_

We regularly launch commercial offers to drive traffic and increase sales in our stores. Many such
commercial offers originated in France but have been successfully exported to Other countries where
we operate and have become just as recognizable in such countries, particularly in Spain. The success
of these commercial offers in different markets builds and reinforces the dynamism and attractiveness
of our stores, in France or in another country.

The evolution of our commercial offers illustrates our constant desire to create added value, enhance
the lives of our customers and offer a new and unique selling experience to franchisees. In the early
days of our operating history through the 1980s, the commercial offers were focused on price,
democratizing the optical product market and rendering it more accessible. In the 1990s, we began to
focus on products, offering the first private label lenses and ready readers (which would eventually
include contact lenses starting in 2002), which transformed our brand to signify not just a retailer, but
also a provider of cutting edge products. In 1999, we introduced multi-possession with our Tchin Tchin
offer that, for one franc (then €1.00), gives consumers the chance to own another pair of eyeglasses at
very low additional cost, which was expanded with Tercera in 2004. The Tercera program was
eventually transformed into a Summer/Winter promotion that offered two additional pairs of glasses for
€1.00 more. In 2009, during the economic crisis, we launched NextYear to allow customers to have
access to optical products and maintain a relatively low price. In 2017, we launched "Smart Tonic"
(which we have since renamed "Magic"), a collection of frames with magnetic clips for sun protection,
blue-light filter and night driving. In 2020, we launched "Serenity", insurance coverage for breakage and
theft of glasses with very limited cost for the end customer.

to encourage them to opt for multi-possession. Our communications regarding commercial offers and
our latest advertisements are also present in the store's display posters for maximum impact.

In 2012, we decided to develop our online sales activity. Progressively, we took a series of strategic
decisions related to our online sales activity that we currently assemble in a single global digital offer.

Notably, we are exploring the possibilities of increasing our online presence due to regulatory changes
introduced as part of the Loi Hamon in 2014. Currently we maintain websites in the languages of the
principal countries where our banners operate, namely French, Spanish, Portuguese and Flemish for
Alain Afflelou and French for Optical Discount and in French and Spanish for Alain Afflelou Acousticien.
According to a market survey of French respondents conducted in 2018, the Alain Afflelou website was
tied for first among the most visited websites in connection with a purchase of eyewear, and in first
position when visits are cumulative. Additionally, in September 2016, we acquired two online pure
players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com, both of which engaged in the online sale of optical products.
Happyview.fr was a website that sold corrective lenses and frames and was approved by the French
Health Ministry and the French social security system. We have integrated the Happyview.fr activities
into our French Afflelou website and we began selling corrective glasses on Afflelou.com in 2020.
Malentille.com is a website that has sold contact lenses in France since 2006 and will continue to serve
customers on its own platform with back-end integration with the Group's online activities. For further
information regarding the online sale of optical products, see "Industry—The optical product market—
_Optical product competitive landscape"._

The online eyewear activity has been relatively slow to catch on in Europe due to regulatory constraints
which require a prescription prior to the sale of corrective eyeglasses, consumer shopping patterns that
favor trying on eyewear in person and a lower sales penetration rate generally than the United States,
for example. For further information regarding regulatory constraints in our main markets, see
"Regulation".

The following sections briefly describe our online activities, which are part of our digital transformation
plan, across our banners and our optical and hearing aids business lines.

**_Communications_**

Our online presence primarily serves as a means to identify, inform and interact with existing and
potential customers, including via social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram,
Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok, online advertisements, newsletters and descriptions of our products,
services and commercial offers. In addition to these online communications initiatives directly-owned
stores and individual franchisees may also operate their own Facebook pages.

**_Web-to-store/multi-channel initiatives and 24/7 access_**

Our main online activity has since our beginning been concentrated on developing web-to-store traffic
and multi-channel relationships with customers. Stimulating web-to-store traffic is achieved in a number
of ways, including through geolocation functionalities on www.Afflelou.com which directs the user to
their nearest point of sale, a click-and-collect sales feature offering free or discounted delivery of online
purchases to a nearby store and an application that lets users digitally try on glasses by recording the
user's face with a webcam and superimposing a model of the eyeglasses on the digital image. These
initiatives seek to provide customers with a forum that is always available to our customers and
potentially increase traffic into stores and convert such visits into sales by familiarizing customers with
our products.

**_Online sales_**

We sell mostly sunglasses, ready readers, contact lenses and contact lens solutions online, as these
categories do not require vision exams or fitting and consumers are less likely to want to try out the
products before purchasing. Online sales are made through our websites, which offer free shipping to
stores and, in certain countries such as France and Spain, directly to customers' homes with a service
charge. Each sale completed through our websites is allocated to a physical store (either franchisee or
directly-owned) that is nearest to the customer, thus avoiding cannibalization of sales. We operate the
online pure player Malentille.com which is focused on online sales of contact lenses, while the Alain
Afflelou and Optical Discount online activities are dedicated to a broader range of products, including
corrective glasses for Alain Afflelou. We are currently rationalizing our e-commerce offer across the
various brands, alongside a digital transformation plan which aims to simplify the customer journey with
Alain Afflelou. To this end, we have incorporated the activities of Happview.fr into our French Afflelou
website. Malentille.com continues to serve customers on its own platform with back-end integration with
the Group's online activities and has been renamed Malentille by Afflelou.

**_Franchisee development information_**

Our online presence is also focused on the further development of our franchisee network. Dedicated
websites, such as http://www.jouvreunmagasinafflelou.com, direct opticians and audio prosthetists to
learn more about franchise opportunities with our banners.

**CUSTOMER SERVICE**

Presenting a consistent customer experience is an important component of our strategy. We provide a
customer service hotline which answers queries from customers and franchisees regarding our
products and commercial offers. We have put in place a team dedicated to this activity in France. In
addition, we feel that all the services that we provide in our role as franchisor to the members of our
networks fully contribute to improving customer service.

We regularly receive awards for our offering and our customer service. We have also won a number of
industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer service provider of the year by the
_Elu service client de l'année (ESCDA)_ market survey, conducted by Viseo Customer Insights, in France
for five years in a row (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021), "Óptica del año" by Inma Stratmarketing for
best optician in Spain in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, "best franchise in shopping centre" by the
Asociación Española de Centros Comerciales in 2018 and "foreign franchise with the best implantation
in the Spanish market" by the Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018, as well as for our television
and video advertisements which customers easily recall. Some of our franchisees also won the award
of best hearing aid and optical franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020 by the Fédération des Réseaux
_Européens de Partenariats et de Franchise (IREF)._

**SOURCING, BRANDING AND MANUFACTURING**

**_Sourcing_**

We maintain a flexible and efficient sourcing policy premised on long and trusting relationships with our
suppliers. Our main partners and suppliers are Essilor-Luxottica, Safilo, Marcolin and De Rigo with
respect to designer frames and sunglasses, Essilor-Luxottica, Hoya, Seiko and Carl Zeiss with respect
to lenses, Bausch & Lomb, Alcon, and Johnson & Johnson with respect to contact lenses and
Sivantos/Siemens with respect to hearing aid products. These suppliers are among our most important
suppliers during the last three years. For more information about our and our franchisees' risk of
dependence on certain suppliers and service providers, see "Risk Factors—Risks related to our supply
_activities—We and our franchisees rely significantly on certain suppliers and service providers"._

For products that we market under our own brands, or for which we have obtained a license to produce,
Okia and its network of independent factories in Asia has historically been our preferred intermediary
for the external manufacturing of our exclusive products. Okia, which is a Chinese intermediary, is not
a manufacturer but rather puts us in contact with a network of independent factories in Asia and allows
us to obtain manufacturing conditions all while enjoying a unique commercial relationship. To develop
our "Made in France" collection, we have recently begun developing our relationships with
manufacturers in France. We also source part of our own collections from a Japanese manufacturer
that is specialized in value-added products. For more information, see "—External manufacturing".

Our main interactions with our suppliers consist of: (i) negotiating common commercial terms and
conditions that benefit all of our networks; (ii) purchasing and reselling optical products, namely lenses
and contact lenses; (iii) arranging the manufacturing for our signature brand eyewear and licensed
products; and (iv) entering into arrangements with suppliers pursuant to which such supplier partners
provide logistics services and support to benefit our franchisees and directly-owned stores. Suppliers
that fulfill the criteria that we set have access to our central listing unit.

**_Branding activities_**

In 2014, we created our "Afflelou" signature label, which comprises a range of ophthalmic frames, ready
readers and sunglasses. Our product design team (for our signature brand collections and licensed
product collections) is composed of designers and product managers based in Geneva.

In order to develop our new collections, the product design team selects designs based on the latest
trends and analysis of sales information from previous collections. We endeavor to continually introduce
new models and update existing models while maintaining best sellers. In terms of ophthalmic frames
and sunglasses, approximately 2.3 million Afflelou-branded frames and 0.6 million _Magic_ clips were
delivered to our network in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020, and a variety of new SKUs are
introduced each month allowing us to continuously renew our product offering.

192


-----

Our product design team curates pieces for our signature brand products based on hand-drawn
sketches and computer-rendered technical drawings provided by our manufacturers. The technical
drawings are then used to define colors, materials and styles. Our creative director approves each
technical design before being confirmed to the manufacturer for prototype creation.

In order to subcontract the production of a large number of SKUs that we market under our own brands,
we make use of flexible manufacturing that allows a range of SKUs to be created each year with low
incremental cost. This technique allows us to continuously renew our product offering by delivering a
fashionable flair at a lower price point than luxury brand eyewear.

**_External manufacturing_**

We do not undertake manufacturing of our proprietary and licensed products. Instead, we outsource
prototype creation and production, mostly to supplier partners in Asia. Our main sourcing relationship
partner, Okia, works with a network of various manufacturing plants. For certain high-end models that
we market under our own brands, we contract for their production with certain manufacturers in France
in order to obtain the "Made in France" label in compliance with applicable French and EU regulations.
This label indicates that the products were entirely made in France or that their last transformation
occurred in France.

**LOGISTICS**

We outsource our logistics functions with our supplier partners and a logistics partner through a special
plan called "facing fix" which is designed to reduce the level of stock in our networks of stores. We have
entered into agreements with certain of our exclusive lens suppliers (notably Essilor-Luxottica and
Hoya) with respect to the storage of a buffer of inventory consisting of signature label frames and
sunglasses. As a result of this arrangement, Afflelou brand frames and sunglasses purchased by end
customers (either as a first product, or a second or third pair as part of the Tchin Tchin commercial
offer) can be ordered by each franchisee selling such product together with the relevant lenses from
such lens suppliers if they request that the supplier handles cutting and mounting for the Tchin Tchin
glasses. The lenses and the frame arrive together so that the opticians may mount and fit them in the
store. In other cases, the frames will come from our logistics partner.

This allows stores in our network to generally maintain only one display unit of each of our signature
brand frames and sunglasses in the store and make multiple sales of such products per day. Stores
only order a product from a supplier after the customer has confirmed the order.

For contact lenses, our warehousing and logistical support is also performed by the aforementioned
external partner managing part of the exclusive frames products. We sell contact lenses through our
central purchasing unit, which also acts as a dedicated ordering, logistics and fulfillment portal (which
we refer to as "Call"), both to franchisees and end customers through our various online offers. The
external partner manages the inventory and then fulfils the order once it has been confirmed.

Finally, for the stock of non-prescription sunglasses that we sell under our own brand, our European
partners manage the logistics and fulfillment of orders by franchisees.

Third-party products that are ordered by franchisees and directly-owned stores from any listed suppliers
through our central listing unit are delivered directly to the relevant store by such third parties.

**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**

We maintain a centralized information technology ("IT") infrastructure that serves our headquarters,
franchisor activities, and directly-owned store operations and also provides certain IT support and
services to franchisees. The main objectives of our internal IT capabilities are to: (i) develop internal
standards; (ii) collect information from our store network; (iii) connect points of sale to centralized
databases; (iv) operate and supervise our online platforms such as the Afflelou Store and e-learning
portals; and (v) assist in the maintenance of business continuity. IT systems that we manage include
accounting and human resources software solutions, network monitoring, central purchasing and
central listing and payment systems, communications systems and office equipment. We house our
systems on two cloud-based datacenters.

Our IT team works with major in-store optical software providers and has developed a common,
customized interface for us and our store network (called "Entrenous"). Franchisees are able to choose
the in-store software provider of their choice from among our relationship suppliers. In-store software is
purchased directly by the relevant franchisee.

193


-----

The following briefly describes the main software platforms (proprietary, licensed or combination of
both) that we consider important to carrying out our activities:

    - _Call: The Call platform is an ordering, logistics and fulfillment portal accessible by directly-_
owned stores and franchisees that enables them to directly place a global order for lenses
and frames with one of two global supply partners (Essilor-Luxottica or Hoya) and receive
the fitted eyewear directly from such supplier;

    - _Entrenous: In-house point of sale software interface loaded onto selected third-party point_
of sale software; and

    - _Cimsup: Licensed platform that provides inventory tracking for directly-owned stores to_
assist in monitoring the sale of proprietary frames.

    - _Salesforce: we have implemented Salesforce software to manage our customer database_
and more generally our customer relationship management program since 2017.

    - _Microsoft PowerBI: we have implemented the Microsoft PowerBI solution to manage_
franchisee performance.

We have dedicated significant effort in recent years to improve the tools that are available to endcustomers, building up a large client database (both nationwide in France and Spain and at-store level),
which is linked to and fed by our franchisees' point of sale systems and allows us to collect day-to-day
data on network performance. We are currently focused on growing the proportion of franchisees that
are sharing their client database with us (currently 86% of the total number of stores in France and
nearly 100% in Spain). Our long-term ambition for our digital transformation plan is to significantly
expand the end-customer data we have access to and explore opportunities to link this information
more closely with our banners, which we expect to be assisted by a growing proportion of endcustomers sharing their data and using our digital platform.

**EMPLOYEES**

As of January 31, 2021, we employed 1,270 individuals (all types of work contracts included).

**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT**

As of January 31, 2021, we carried out our business throughout networks consisting of 1,435 stores, of
which 1,275 were operated by franchisees and 160 were directly operated. As a result of our main
franchisor activity, we do not own any significant tangible assets. As of January 31, 2021, the fixed
tangible assets that we rent consist mainly of:

    - administrative buildings used as offices for our administrative and business purposes in the
countries in which we operate our business, in particular, France, Spain, Belgium,
Luxembourg, Portugal and Switzerland. The Issuer's registered office is located at 11, rue
d'Argenson 75008 Paris, France. Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, one of our subsidiaries, rents
this as an office through a commercial lease agreement entered into on December 27, 2013
for a term of nine years beginning on January 1, 2014; and

    - the 160 stores (as of January 31, 2021) that we directly operate mainly in France, Spain
and Portugal. For further information concerning our directly-owned stores, see "—
_Distribution channels—Store networks"._

Our other fixed tangible assets consist of various equipment and fixtures at our administrative offices
(mainly furniture and computer hardware), as well as furnishings and equipment for use in our directlyowned stores, whether they are owned by us (mainly furniture and computer hardware) or rented.

**RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, PATENTS AND LICENSES**

In light of the importance of intellectual property rights in our business, we maintain a policy of vigilantly
protecting our main intellectual property rights in particular: (i) frames that we distribute under our own
brand names, including the "Afflelou" signature label; (ii) the technologies related to the frames that we
distribute under our own brand names; (iii) the lenses that we develop in partnerships with market
leaders and then market under our own brand names such as "Égérie" and "Protect"; and (iv) contact
lenses that we develop and distribute under our own brand names such as "Éphémère". Our intellectual
property policy is based on protecting our brand and domain names. This policy leads to local
registrations or reservations or registrations or reservations in all countries in which we would like to
protect our rights.

194


-----

We have put in place a policy to prevent counterfeiting, concentrating particularly on France and Asia.
The teams of stylists, as well as those working in our store networks, inform the legal department of
any potential counterfeiting. After reviewing each situation on a case-by-case basis, and if the conditions
are satisfied, we initiate legal proceedings against the alleged counterfeiter.

**_Types of intellectual property_**

_Brands and domain names_

As of July 31, 2020, we maintained a portfolio of more than 750 registered trademarks in the main
countries where we carry out business, at the national, European community and international level, as
the case may be, in order to ensure an adapted and optimal protection of our business. These
trademarks mainly include signs and logos incorporating the names "Alain Afflelou", "Afflelou", "Optical
Discount" or "Alain Afflelou Acousticien" as well as certain other secondary signs and promotional
offerings, such as "Tchin Tchin", "La Forty d'Afflelou" ("Forty by Afflelou") or "NextYear".

As of July 31, 2020, we had successfully filed more than 400 domain names in France and abroad,
including "Alain Afflelou", "Afflelou", "Optical Discount", "Tchin Tchin" and "Forty", in various forms and
extensions, in order to secure our rights over these names in all the countries in which we carry out
business.

_Brands and trademarks_

As of July 31, 2020, we maintained a portfolio of over 30 brands and trademarks registered in France
and eight brands and trademarks registered in the main countries in which we carry out business, at
the national or international level, as the case may be, in order to ensure an adapted and optimal
protection of the frames that we distribute under our own brand "Afflelou".

**_Patents, licenses, user rights and other intangible fixed assets_**

_License agreements that we issue_

We negotiate partnerships with certain worldwide leading producers of ophthalmic lenses to enter into
brand license agreements for the production and development, in partnership with us, of products that
use the latest technology. Moreover, we supervise the development of contact lenses that we distribute
under our own brands, such as "Éphémère". As such, we have granted licenses to those with whom we
develop these products, allowing them to use the technologies that we have developed.

_License agreements issued to us_

We do not possess any significant right of use or intellectual property rights from third parties, except
for software licenses used for the management of our databases, processing e-mails as well as the
operation, development and maintenance of our technological platforms and our information system.

**INSURANCE**

We maintain insurance to cover risks associated with the ordinary course of our business, including
property and franchisor liability policies that are specific to the industry in which we operate, at levels
that we believe are appropriate when taking into account our size and the risks incurred. Our insurance
programs are negotiated and coordinated by our general counsel, who is responsible for identifying our
insurable risks, quantifying their potential consequences for us, and designing or structuring adequate
insurance programs with the support of leading insurance brokers with international networks. We aim
to ensure that we maintain sufficient coverage for all our activities and locations. We have established
internal claims procedures for each of our insurance policies in the event we experience a loss. We also
periodically review our insurance coverage in light of innovative and new risk transfer solutions offered
by the insurance markets in order to ensure that the terms and conditions of our coverage are adequate,
to verify that our deductibles and premiums are at reasonable levels and to reflect changes in our risk
profile that arise as a result of events such as mergers and acquisitions, new fields of activity and the
development of new technologies. We do not operate, rent or own any captive insurance vehicles.

Our main insurance policies, entered into with reputable insurance companies, cover types of
exposures including the following:

    - general business liability insurance in regards to our headquarters, which covers real estate
and property damage, business interruptions and third-party claims;

    - fraud insurance, which covers costs related to harm to our brand and reputation;

195


-----

    - franchisor civil liability insurance;

    - directors' and officers' civil liability insurance; and

    - cyber risk insurance.

Our insurance policies contain exclusions, caps and deductibles that could expose us to unfavorable
consequences in the event of a significant event or legal action against it. Moreover, we may be required
to indemnify third parties for certain damages that are not covered by our insurance policies or to incur
significant expenses that may not be covered, or may be insufficiently covered, under our insurance
policies. In addition, the efficacy of our insurance coverage depends on the ongoing viability of our
insurers. See also "Risk Factors—Risks related to our general operations—We may incur liabilities that
_are not covered by insurance"._

**LEGAL AND ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS**

We may be implicated in legal, arbitration, administrative or regulatory proceedings within the normal
course of our activities, in particular in relation to our franchisees. We record a provision when there is
a sufficient probability that such proceedings will create costs for us or one of our subsidiaries and when
the amount of these costs may be reasonably estimated. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum,
we have no knowledge of any governmental, judiciary or arbitral proceedings (including any proceeding
of which we are aware that is unresolved or which threatens us), other than those mentioned below,
that is likely to have an effect or has had a significant impact during the last twelve months on our
financial situation or profitability. See also "Risk Factors—Risks related to legal and regulatory
_matters—Risks related to disputes"._

**_Proceeding concerning alleged antitrust practices as the result of a vertical agreement_**
**_concerning the price of frames_**

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, an indirect subsidiary of the Issuer, is involved in an antitrust proceeding
initiated by the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) in relation to certain
anticompetitive practices concerning the prices of certain frames, alleged to have occurred during the
2000s among certain manufacturers and distributors, including Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, in violation
of Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101-1 of the Treaty on the Functioning
of the European Union.

In this regard, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received a notice of complaint from the French Competition
Authority in May 2015. Alain Afflelou Franchiseur replied to the notice in July 2015, refuting all
allegations of anticompetitive practices.

In July 2016, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received a reply from the French Competition Authority rejecting
all rebuttals presented by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, but did however reduce the initial period during
which the alleged practices occurred, and stated that such practices occurred between February 25,
2005 and December 31, 2009 and set a maximum sanction of approximately €12.5 million. Alain
Afflelou Franchiseur responded to the French Competition Authority on October 13, 2016, vigorously
contesting all allegations.

Even if Alain Afflelou Franchiseur intends to continue to defend against all of the French Competition
Authority's allegations, we cannot exclude the possibility that the French Competition Authority may
impose a fine and cannot exclude the possibility that the amount of such fine may be in excess of the
above mentioned maximum amount. In light of applicable regulations, information in the French
Competition Authority's July 2016 report, the French Competition Authority's past decisions and its
instruction dated May 16, 2011 on sanctions, a potential sanction could be in an amount between 0%
and 30% of Alain Afflelou Franchiseur's revenue from the sales of products implicated in the proceeding.
This amount will then be multiplied by a coefficient based on the alleged duration of the infraction (i.e.,
according to the French Competition Authority's July 2016 opinion, between February 25, 2005 and
December 31, 2009) and, if necessary, increased by up to 50% of the fine for repeat offenses, as Alain
Afflelou Franchiseur has been sanctioned in the past by the French Competition Authority. As of the
date of this Offering Memorandum, no provision has been set aside in the Issuer's consolidated
accounts for this proceeding.

On February 24, 2017, the French Competition Authority rendered a decision in these antirust
proceedings. In this decision, the French Competition Authority referred the matter for further procedural
inquiry. We cannot speculate as to what the result of these procedural inquiries will be but note that the
agreement in question has not been identified.

196


-----

On April 19, 2019, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received, along with other manufacturers and distributors
involved in this proceeding, a notification of further notice of complaint by the French Competition
Authority. This notice does not contain any new complaint specific to Alain Afflelou Franchiseur.

On March 2, 2020, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received an additional report by the French Competition
Authority, in which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur was not directly implicated, however Alain Afflelou
Franchiseur has made a reply to the French Competition Authority responding to certain arguments
raised in the proceeding.

A hearing on this matter was held on January 13, 2021, during which the defendants argued that the
statute of limitations has expired and that the matter is now time-barred. We are awaiting a further
decision from the French Competition Authority.

**_Reassessment of the Group's VAT deduction from the French tax authorities_**
In December 2017, the Group received a notice of a proposed reassessment from the French tax
authorities following an audit relating to VAT deduction made by Optical Finance (the franchisor
operating the Optical Discount banner), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the period from January
1, 2014 to November 30, 2016. The French tax authorities concluded that Optical Finance participated
in a VAT tax evasion scheme during such period. The French tax authorities' reassessment included
adjustments amounting to €1.5 million (€966,000 in tax reassessment, €386,000 in penalties and
€134,000 in late payment interest). Following receipt of the tax authorities' confirmed reassessment for
the full amount on August 16, 2018, the Group provisionally decided to pay the sum corresponding to
the principal of the reassessment (€966,000). However, we believe that the French tax authorities'
position is unfounded and decided to challenge the decision. On March 5, 2019, the French tax
authorities rejected the challenge. Therefore, we decided to contest this decision before the French
administrative tribunal of Paris and thus filed a claim on March 29, 2019. The Group also exercised its
call option pursuant to the vendor warranties issued by the vendor's shareholders relating to its
acquisition of Optical Finance (such vendor warranties being however capped at €1 million).
**_Tax proceedings on the Group's income tax from the French tax authorities_**

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur was subject to a tax audit for the period from August 1, 2009 to July 31, 2012.
As a result of this audit, the French tax authorities issued a tax reassessment notice mainly reassessing
the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain holdings in 2010, claiming that such sale price
should have been higher in order to be considered as having been made at arm's length. As we believe
there are robust arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities, we filed a claim with
the French lower administrative court on December 28, 2018, which was rejected by the French tax
authorities and thus led us to file a request with the French administrative court of Montreuil on March
11, 2021.

In December 2018, we received a notice of a proposed reassessment of our income tax for the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 from the French tax authorities. This proposed
reassessment relates to the deduction of interest charges relating to the 14% interest rate on convertible
bonds issued by 3ABOD (which now sit at the level of the Issuer) (i.e. the Shareholder Bonds) in July
2012 for an amount of €203.3 million, in relation to the acquisition of the Group by the Sponsors. The
French tax authorities consider, on the grounds of the abuse of law theory, that the interest on the
Shareholder Bonds should not have been deducted from the corporate tax, to the extent the
Shareholder Bonds qualify as an equity financing by the main shareholders, and correspond to dividend
distributions. Based on legal advice, we have contested this proposed reassessment in a response sent
to the French tax authorities in February 2019. On March 30, 2021, the French tax authorities confirmed
however that the reassessment was maintained and that the case could be referred to the tax abuse
committee (Comité de l'abus de droit fiscal). We intend to submit our case to the opinion of the tax law
abuse committee. In addition, in March 2021, the French tax authorities launched a second tax audit
with respect to the fiscal years ended July 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses carried forward amounted to €65.4 million as of January
31, 2021. According to our preliminary estimates, if the French tax authorities were to prevail concerning
the second and third disputes discussed above, it could result in both (i) a reduction of the amount of
tax losses carried forward for an amount (estimated as of the date of this Offering Memorandum) of
deferred tax assets of approximately €58 million and (ii) the payment of (x) income taxes for the years
subject to tax reassessment or tax audit as well as the first six months of the 2021 fiscal year (i.e., from
August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021) and (y) related penalties for a maximum total estimated amount
as of the date hereof of approximately €21 million based on the current status of the procedure. We
dispute the findings of the French tax administration and intend to challenge the administration's position

197


-----

in the next coming weeks. However, we cannot predict the timing or the final outcome of this challenge
or more generally the above proceedings and we cannot guarantee that the ultimate tax impacts for the
Group will not differ from the amounts referred to above. Furthermore, the Group may face an additional
tax burden in respect of future fiscal years depending on the outcome of the dispute with the tax
administration and the position retained by the Group on the tax treatment of the interest on the
Shareholder Bonds.

**Regulation**

_We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and industry standards in the jurisdictions in which_
_we operate. The following provides a brief description of the main laws and regulations that govern our_
_activities and personnel in our two main markets, France and Spain. References and discussions to_
_directives, laws, regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by_
_the full text of such directives, laws, regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents_
_themselves._

This section describes the regulations applicable to the optical and hearing aid retail industry in our two
main markets, France and Spain.

**European Laws and Regulations**

_Data Protection Law_

As retailers, we Process customer data notably for marketing purposes, as well as Personal Data of
other individuals such as employees or suppliers. Compliance with data protection laws must therefore
be ensured. Our ability to collect, store and Process such Personal Data is governed by data protection
and privacy regulations and guidance issued by, among others, the data protection supervisory bodies
in Europe such as the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The privacy regulations include, for
example, the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC.

The GDPR provides a common framework within the European Union for data protection and regulates
the Processing and transfer of Personal Data. In the course of our activities, we may act as a "Controller"
or as a "Processor", as defined by the GDPR, depending on our role and the capacity within which we
Process Personal Data belonging to Data Subjects. As required by the GDPR, we have designated the
French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l'informatique et des Libertés) ("CNIL") as
lead supervisory authority.

The GDPR and local legislations in the European Union impose a strict data protection compliance
regime including:

     - the accountability principle, requiring companies to demonstrate and record compliance with
the GDPR, including the maintenance of a detailed record of Personal Data Processing
activities as required by Article 30 of the GDPR;

     - the appointment of a data protection officer, in certain circumstances;

     - the requirements to Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to
Process Personal Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the
accuracy of Personal Data, limit the retention of Personal Data for no longer than is necessary,
and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against
unauthorized Processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data;

     - an obligation to provide clear notice of Personal Data Processing activities to Data Subjects,
which must include, among other details: the identity of the Controller; the nature and purpose
of the Processing activities; the legal basis applicable to each Processing activity; the
categories of Personal Data Processed, the recipients to whom the Personal Data are
disclosed; the rights of the Data Subjects; and details of any cross-border transfers of
Personal Data;

     - an obligation to include certain mandatory contractual terms in agreements with certain
service providers which Process Personal Data on our behalf as required by Article 28 of the
GDPR;

     - restrictions on the export of Personal Data to recipients located in countries outside of the
European Economic Area;

     - obligations to consider data protection issues with respect to the development of any new
products or services which involve the Processing of Personal Data ("data protection by
design"), and to ensure that by default, the amount of Personal Data Processed is limited to
what is necessary in the context of the relevant Processing activity ("data protection by
default");

-----

     - a requirement to undertake a data protection impact assessment with respect to Processing
activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of relevant Data
Subjects as required by Article 35 of the GDPR;

     - obligations to comply with the data protection rights conferred on Data Subjects including,
in certain circumstances: a right to be informed; a right of access to Personal Data; a right to
rectification of Personal Data; a right to obtain restriction of Processing; a right to object to
Processing; a right to data portability (i.e., to request that Personal Data be transferred to
another Controller); a right not to be subject to certain types of profiling or automated decision
making; and a right to request erasure of Personal Data; and

     - an obligation to notify Personal Data Breaches to Supervisory Authorities without undue
delay and no later than 72 hours after detection of the relevant Personal Data Breach, except
where the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of
individuals, and an obligation to notify affected Data Subjects without undue delay, if the
Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected
Data Subjects.

The GDPR introduces fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide
revenue or €20 million. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the
level of fines to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data
Subjects also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress)
in certain circumstances. Data Subjects may bring complaints via the courts, or via
Supervisory Authorities, or both, and in some circumstances may have a choice as to the EU
Member State(s) in which they bring such claims. Although we take extensive efforts to comply
with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not be subject to
regulatory and/or private action, including fines, for non-compliance with data protection and
privacy laws, including in the event of a security incident. We could be adversely affected if
legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in our business practices or if
governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that
negatively affect our business or financial condition.

We work to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and
information security. Dedicated employees are in charge of data protection compliance within the Group
and provide support for data protection and privacy-related requests. We maintain privacy information
notices for individuals whose Personal Data is processed, enter into data processing agreements,
conduct data protection impact assessments when necessary, perform product and feature reviews,
and maintain a reasonably exhaustive list of data collected and processed. We take a variety of
technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data,
including data pertaining to customers and employees. Despite measures we put in place, we may be
unable to anticipate or prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of such data.

**France**

Our primary business is providing services and support to our franchisees. In our capacity as franchisor,
we are subject to certain laws and regulations governing our business and relationships with our
franchisees (including pursuant to the French Civil Code and French Commercial Code). In addition, in
our capacity as operator of our directly-owned stores, we are subject to regulation as a retailer and
distributor of optical and hearing aid products. In France, the optical and hearing aid product markets
are highly regulated, as optical and hearing aid products are considered to be healthcare products. A
particularity of the optical and hearing aid retail market in France is the historical existence of a system
that provides for patient reimbursement through both the public health insurance system and
complementary health insurance providers. The regulations applicable to the industry have recently
undergone, and may continue to undergo in the future, changes, particularly in respect of the
complementary health insurance reimbursement system.

**_Regulations governing franchise operations in France_**

In France, various provisions set out relationships between franchisor and franchisee and operate to
afford protection to franchisees, including as a result of the _Loi Doubin (Law no. 89-1008 of_
December 31, 1989) (the "Loi Doubin") and certain provisions of the French Commercial Code.
Franchisees are in principle deemed to be independent entrepreneurs. The _Loi Doubin and certain_
provisions of the French Commercial Code provide certain protections to franchisees in the context of
the entering into of a franchise agreement and franchisors are subject to regulations preventing undue

200


-----

interference of a franchisor in franchisees' business operations, as well as requiring that franchisors
provide certain information to franchisees and potential franchisees. For example, franchisors are
required to provide potential franchisees, or current franchisees contemplating the opening of a new
store, with certain information at least 20 days prior to entering into a franchise agreement. Such precontractual information ("Document d'Information Précontractuel" or "DIP") should address, among
other things, the franchisor's performance, network, industry, local market and terms of the franchise
agreement. French law also contains various other important provisions that could apply to franchising
relationships including for instance specific rules and requirements regarding (i) payments that may be
required prior to conclusion of the franchise agreement and their consideration, (ii) duration and
termination of contracts in the context of "commercial distribution networks" ("réseaux de distribution
_commerciale"), as well as (iii) non-competition provisions and, in particular, post-contractual relationship_
non-competition provisions. Moreover, issues in terms of exclusivity commitments and competition law
may arise in the context of franchising relationships, including regarding vertical restraints and price
fixing issues. Ordonnance no. 2016-131 dated February 10, 2016 reforming general contract law and
proof of obligations came into force on October 1, 2016. This ordinance introduced new provisions to
French law, as subsequently amended by Law no. 2018-287 of April 20, 2018, certain of which are
likely to have an impact on the franchise relationships and contracts and the DIP that we enter into with
our franchisees.

**_Regulations governing business-to-business relationships, including relationships between_**
**_suppliers and distributors (purchase for resale) in France_**

Relationships between supplier and distributors as well as any other commercial (business-to-business)
relationships are more generally regulated in France. Specific rules apply notably to (i) business
partners' negotiations and formalization of their relationships (ii) payment terms and late payments
mechanisms and (iii) certain prohibited practices (e.g. obtaining or seeking to obtain an advantage that
has no consideration or that is manifestly disproportionate compared to the value of the service
provided, submitting or attempting to submit the other party to obligations creating a "significant
imbalance" in the parties' rights and obligations, "sudden termination" of an established commercial
relationship; etc). The legal framework of these prohibited practices has been recently amended,
including by the Ordinance 2019-359 dated 24 April 2019 and laws 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020
and dated December 3, 2020.

In relation to relationships between suppliers and distributors (purchase for resale), there exist strict
rules and regulations under French law. Depending on the type of product purchased/sold, there are
specific requirements applicable to the parties' negotiations and to the formalization of the parties'
relationship in a specific agreement, whose content and duration are strictly regulated.

**_Regulations governing business-to-consumer relationships in France (including in an "e-_**
**_commerce" context)_**

A wide range of rules and requirements apply in the context of business-to-consumer relationships,
often as a result of EU legislation, including for instance in terms of (i) consumer information, for instance
on such things as the price (ii) content and clarity of contracts (iii) prohibition of unfair commercial
practices and unfair contract terms, (iv) distance selling and online trading (v) conformity and safety of
products, and (vi) legal guarantees. Some additional rules also apply in the context of e-commerce
relationships between customers and professionals. This is for instance the case for specific withdrawal
rights offered to customers in such context or reinforced transparency obligations vis-à-vis such
customers. Moreover, consumer credits are also specifically and strictly regulated in France and should
be taken into account if a company is engaged in consumer credit activities.

**_Regulations governing the optical product and hearing aid market in France_**

_Access to the optician and audio prosthetist professions_

Opticians are licensed professionals who are able, generally subject to a prior prescription, to perform
eye tests, advise on the selection of corrective lenses and dispense such products for the purposes of
vision correction. To qualify as an optician in France, students must obtain a certificate in optical studies
(Brevet de Technicien Supérieur Opticien Lunetier, or "BTS", or brevet professionnel d'opticien-lunetier)
or benefit from an equivalent certificate or practical experience in another European Union Member
State as well as from an individual authorization to practice in France. To qualify as an audio prosthetist
in France, students must obtain a specific audio prosthetist diploma (Diplôme d'État d'audioprothésiste)
or any diploma enabling a person to operate as a physician in France or benefit from an equivalent

201


-----

diploma or practical experience in another European Union Member State as well as from an individual
authorization to practice in France.

_Sales of optical and hearing aid products_

The French Public Health Code (Code de la santé publique) historically provided that commercial
establishments whose primary purpose is to sell optical products may only be supervised or managed
by qualified opticians. However, in 2014, the Loi Hamon or La Loi relative à la consommation (Consumer
Affairs Law no. 2014-344 dated March 17, 2014) amended the French Public Health Code (see Art.
L. 4362-9) such that it is no longer necessary for managers of an optical retail store to be qualified
opticians. Nevertheless, optical retail stores must still employ at least one qualified optician during
business hours, who will be responsible for the sale and delivery of corrective lenses and contact lenses.
The Loi Hamon also authorized the sale of optical products over the Internet in France (see Article L.
4362-10-1, implemented by Decree no. 2015-1223, as described below) and requires that
ophthalmologists systematically specify on their prescriptions the interpupillary distance, which is one
of the key details needed to correctly fit a pair of glasses. The development of Internet sales of optical
products may be facilitated as customers use this information to order their optical products from the
Internet. Similar to the regulations limiting the sale of optical products, the French Public Health Code
provides that only audio prosthetists may sell hearing aids in a place compliant with applicable French
regulations (See Articles L. 4361-1 et seq.).

Since January 1, 2018, retailers of optical and hearing aid products have been required to provide
consumers with additional price and product information. The French Ministry of the Economy and
Finance published a ministerial order on April 28, 2017 that requires all optical and hearing aid product
retailers and service providers to clearly indicate in their stores that customers will receive a free and
detailed estimate before any purchase (Articles 1 and 2) and must display the prices for products and
services (Article 3). These same requirements apply to online retailers. The estimate must comply with
a standard form annexed to the ministerial order. All estimates must be maintained for at least one year
after they have been provided to a customer (Article 4). In addition, retailers are required to inform their
clients of certain information concerning optical and hearing aid products such as the country of origin
(Article 5).

_Data protection_

Since entry into force of the GDPR, we are not required to make filings with the Commission Nationale
_Informatique et Libertés or request authorizations with the same entity (except in respect of certain very_
limited exceptions), to process personal data. The GDPR requires that companies that handle personal
data adhere to the GDPR's principles relating to processing of personal data and comply with certain
recordkeeping and processing requirements and be able to demonstrate compliance with the
aforementioned requirements. In addition to the GDPR, French data protection Law no. 78-17 dated
January 6, 1978 as modified applies in France. In the ordinary course of business, opticians and audio
prosthetists in our networks receive and store confidential, personal and sensitive data, such as
medical, social security and health insurance information with respect to customers, and are therefore
subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health
and personal information. In December 2015, the EU approved the GDPR with respect to data
protection. The GDPR enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes
stiff penalties (up to the higher of €20 million and 4% of global turnover) for organizations that fail to
comply. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all member states since May 2018 and to all
European Economic Area member states thereafter. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR,
on January 11, 2017 the EU Commission published a proposal for an e-privacy regulation to replace
the existing e-privacy directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications
sector. Discussions for the adoption of the e-privacy regulation are ongoing, on the basis of the latest
proposal agreed on February 10, 2021 by the Council of the European Union.

_Prescription system_

A medical prescription is required to purchase corrective lenses and contact lenses in France. The
French Public Health Code provides that any doctor is entitled to practice all diagnostic procedures for
both prevention and treatment. In practice, ophthalmologists ordinarily prescribe corrective lenses and
contact lenses. Decree no. 2016-1381 dated October 12, 2016 regarding the conditions for issuing
corrective lenses and contact lenses and the regulations governing the exercise of the profession of
dispensing optician, issued by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and last modified by a
Decree n°2020-475, introduced a number of changes mainly concerning the conditions for issuing
optical products. Pursuant to this decree, a prescription from an ophthalmologist for correct lenses is

202


-----

generally valid for five years (unless provided otherwise by the ophthalmologist), with some exceptions
for patients in certain age groups, while the first prescription for contact lenses is valid for one year.
Unless expressly stated otherwise by the prescribing doctor, the optician may adapt the medical
prescription on renewal following a refraction test. In the event of loss or breakage of corrective lenses
and in the case of an emergency, the optician may issue corrective lenses without a medical
prescription. A medical prescription is also required to purchase hearing aids in France. Ear, nose and
throat specialists or a general physician benefiting from a specific training are allowed to prescribe
hearing aids. Currently, a prescription for hearing aids is valid for one year. Following the 100% Santé
reforms, there is now the option for licensed opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by
French public health insurance and OCAMs, up to €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses
with a prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago.

France is experiencing a shortage of ophthalmologists and the 2015 Loi de Santé (Law no. 2016-41
dated January 26, 2016 to modernize the French healthcare system) is an effort by the French
government to address this shortage by allocating certain responsibilities to opticians, in particular,
when renewing a prescription, opticians can adapt the original prescription, unless the doctor objects
(See Art. L. 4362-10 of the French Public Health Code).

**_Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system_**

In France, the public health system and private health insurers (OCAMs) complement each other to
provide reimbursement for a significant portion of optical and hearing aid expenses. The French
complementary health insurance system generally allows third-party payment (tiers payant), which was
implemented to facilitate and encourage access to healthcare. Through this scheme, reimbursement of
medical expenses is paid directly by the public health system or OCAMs to healthcare providers.

The public health system ordinarily pays a small portion of optical and hearing aid product costs, with
the remainder paid by OCAMs. For example, the public health system covers approximately 5% of
optical product costs, compared to approximately 65% reimbursed by OCAMs. Nonetheless, the public
health system plays a significant role in the optical and hearing aid product markets, as reimbursement
by OCAMs is generally conditional upon reimbursement by the public health system. Over 99% of the
French population was covered by private health insurance plans or CMU as of 2020, according to
Gallileo.

Today, most of the OCAM contracts that are subscribed in France are considered "responsible"
contracts and as such, they are entitled to preferential tax treatment (according to La Direction de la
_recherche, des études, de l'évaluation et des statistiques, over 98% of policyholders benefits from_
responsible contracts). For a contract to be deemed "responsible" it must comply with a number of
criteria, including a subscription fee that does not vary depending on the health condition of the
subscriber. Additionally, as of April 1, 2015, in accordance with Decree no. 2014-1374 relating to the
content of the complementary health insurance policies benefiting from tax and social aids (which
modified Articles R. 871-1 and R. 871-2 of the French Security Health Code, further amended by Decree
n°2019-21 of January 11, 2019), the imposition of minimum and maximum thresholds on
reimbursements of optical products became a criterion required for an OCAM contract to be qualified
as responsible. The maximum threshold for qualifying as "responsible" has been set at €800 for a pair
of glasses. In general, the maximum price for a pair of glasses with unifocal lenses is €420 and €800
for a pair of glasses with multifocal lenses (including a maximum of €100 for frames irrespective of the
type of lenses used). Moreover, the French government has established a "Price Observatory" which
monitors and may adjust these thresholds in the future. Additionally, since the entry into force of Decree
no. 2014-1374, the maximum renewal frequency, initially one year, has been changed to two years
(other than for children under 16 years old or in case of a change in prescription).

Care networks ("réseaux de soins") are third-party platforms organized by insurers that act as
intermediaries between OCAMs and healthcare professionals, including opticians and audio
prosthetists. Opticians that join a care network agree to certain rules imposed by the care network,
including maximum prices for the products they sell or quality certifications. Furthermore, customers
purchasing optical products from a store that has joined a care network may also benefit from thirdparty payment (e.g., payment directly by the OCAMs). Care networks are authorized under Article L.
863-8 of the French Health Security Code provided that certain requirements are met (e.g. the criteria
for joining the network must be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, without any exclusivity
clause, and these networks cannot restrain the patient from freely choosing a health practitioner).

Care networks may be either "open" or "closed", as regards membership by opticians. Open care
networks generally have lower entry requirements than closed care networks, as the number of

203


-----

opticians within an open care network is not limited, only subject to certain conditions and opticians may
apply at any time to be admitted to an open care network. In open care networks, moderate price
rebates negotiated with the opticians are generally estimated at approximately 20% off catalogue prices.
Policyholders who choose to go to an "agreed" optician in the network benefit from slightly lower prices
with no obligations attached. Closed care networks have a numerus clausus, i.e., they set their own
target in terms of number of opticians (balancing the need to cover the territory against the necessity to
direct customers to a particular optician within the network), beyond which the network will no longer
accommodate any new opticians even if they meet the criteria of the network. In practice, this type of
network is created for a period of two to four years, which is renewable through a tender process.
Opticians may only apply before a certain deadline, or period of application. Closed care networks are
more restrictive than open care networks: tighter rules are imposed on opticians, particularly on the type
of products offered to customers and discounts that may be granted (usually between 35% and 40%
off catalogue prices for corrective lenses).

OCAMs may implement differentiated reimbursement levels, depending on whether a policyholder goes
to an optician that has joined the relevant care network or an optician that is outside the care network.
OCAMs may provide a lower level of reimbursement to policyholders who purchase optical products
from opticians that are outside the care network and a higher level of reimbursement to policyholders
who purchase optical products from opticians that have joined the OCAM's care network. As a result of
lower prices and in some cases, differentiated pricing, OCAM's policyholders will be incentivized to go
to the particular optical store within the policyholder's area, that has joined the care network. OCAMs
cannot, on the contrary, provide a different level of reimbursement to policyholders depending on
whether they consult a doctor (such as an ophthalmologist) who is within the network (per Article L.
863-8 of the French Health Security Code).

In France, individuals with annual incomes below certain thresholds may benefit from governmental aid
to access complementary health insurance (the ACS and the CMU-C have been replaced, since
November 1, 2019, by the _Complémentaire Santé Solidaire or "CSS"). The ANI_ provides that all
employers in France must provide private health insurance to their employees as of January 1, 2016.
CSS recipients must choose one complementary insurance program on a list published online on
complementaire-sante-solidaire.gouv.fr. Recipients are entitled to a reduction on their annual
healthcare premium.

In January 2018, the French government began a consultation process in connection with the stated
intention of the French Health Minister to improve access to and reduce costs of healthcare services
for end consumers. The medium-term objective was to ensure that consumers bear no out-of-pocket
costs for certain health-related products, including glasses and hearing aids, by 2021. The new
measures create two categories of glasses, with different pricing rules for each category. The first
category corresponds to the zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer and the second category is not
regulated by the new regime with respect to prices. Both categories however will be covered by new
rules regarding product offerings and reimbursement. The 100% Santé measures were confirmed in
June 2018 and completed by Decree n°2019-21 and include, but are not limited to, the following
provisions for the optical sector:

    - a "zero consumer cost" (RAC Zéro) offer, which consists of a basic "basket" for unifocal
and multifocal glasses (set at approximately €100 and €195, for the most common unifocal
and for multifocal glasses with thin, anti-reflective lenses, respectively). All opticians are
required to make this offer available to customers, offering a minimum range of 17 frames
for adults and 10 frames for children. Every quote to customers must include a zero
consumer cost offer. The basket for frames is set at a maximum of €30. As a comparison,
according to a 2020 Gallileo survey, in France, a pair of unifocal glasses costs consumers
on average €304 and a pair of multifocal glasses costs consumers on average €551;

    - a reduction in the reimbursement cap used by private health insurers to €100 for frames,
as compared to the previous cap of €150 and as contrasted with an average cost for frames
of €113 (for unifocal lenses) and €158 (for multifocal lenses), according to a 2019 Gallileo
survey; and

    - the option for opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by French public health
insurance and OCAMs, up to €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a
prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago.

204


-----

French health care systems have struggled to take the new classification codes of products into
account, especially for lenses, thus making it difficult for opticians to get the necessary information on
reimbursement levels to end customers and, consequently, to invoice end customers.

In the hearing aid sector, similar discussions have also been conducted and the zero consumer cost
(RAC Zéro) offer for hearing aids has been set more progressively (€1,300 in 2019 (the price ceiling for
"Segment I" products, with a co-pay from the customer), €1,100 in 2020 (the price ceiling for "Segment
I" products, with a co-pay from the customer) and €950 in 2021 (the price ceiling for "Segment I"
products, with no co-pay from the customer)). GfK estimated an average price of €1,552 for a hearing
aid device in 2019 which had decreased to an average price of €1,535 by July 2020. Before the full
implementation of the RAC Zéro offer for hearing aids in 2021, the out-of-pocket cost of hearing aids
was between €700 and €1,000, according to a 2019 Arcane report. As in the optical market, there is,
on one hand, a higher proportion of value-added products (such as in-ear devices and remote
headphones) and, on the other hand, the increased offering of reasonably priced devices and, since
January 2021, the ability for end customers to acquire a hearing aid device (valued up to €950) without
any out-of-pocket expense. Pursuant to the 2021 Law on the Financing of the Social Security System,
OCAMs will have to specify, starting in calendar year 2022, in their responsible contracts (as described
above) that customers purchasing optical and hearing aid products covered by 100% Santé are able to
benefit from third-party payment (e.g., payment directly by the OCAMs). These new requirements could
lead to delays in the processing of responsible contracts by OCAMs.

We have engaged a consulting company to assess the potential impact of such changes. The
conclusions of their assessment are as follows:

    - the zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer is expected to have a relatively, limited impact on
the total optical market. Low-price offerings that are below the zero consumer cost offer,
mainly corresponding to CMU (Couverture Maladie Universelle) policy holders totaling
around 8% of glasses buyers, are expected to rapidly align with the zero consumer cost
offer. In addition, a growing population of new glasses wearers (estimated to be less than
one million people) who previously did not purchase glasses due to high prices will also
compensate the negative impact of the alignment of medium to low price offers down to the
zero consumer cost offer. Further, the zero consumer cost offer will attract purchasers of
unifocal lenses, which represent a higher proportion of our customers as compared to the
market. Overall, the zero consumer cost offer is forecast to attract approximately 10% to
20% of glasses wearers.

    - the reduction in the reimbursement cap to €100 for frames (from the previous cap of €150)
is expected to have the most significant impact on the optical market in which we operate
as customers that historically purchases frames below €150 show price sensitivity. The
reduction in reimbursement will put a higher burden on consumers for the difference
between the actual price of the frames and the €100 reimbursement cap. In December
2020, the average cost of frames in France was approximately €130 per frame according
to Gallileo (€113 for monofocal glasses and €158 for multifocal glasses).

Overall, we expect the negative impact of these regulatory changes to be approximately 2% of the total
optical market in terms of value. We believe natural market growth, fueled by positive structural trends
in our industry, including population growth, the increase of glasses wearers as a proportion of the
population and the positive impact of an aging population on the product mix, will be able to compensate
for the impact of these changes. Thus, in spite of these regulatory adjustments, we believe that the
market will be generally stable in the coming years. We believe that the proposed changes, will reinforce
the current consolidation trend in the market towards large banners like ours. Further, we believe that
the reduction of the reimbursement cap on frames to €100 will generally make mid-range products,
such as certain of our Afflelou frames that are typically priced around €99, more attractive to consumers.

**Spain**

Spanish law does not regulate optical or hearing aid retail stores specifically, but rather they are
considered to be health establishments and, accordingly, they are subject to a broad range of national
and autonomous regional regulations regarding establishment, operation, registration, personnel and
working practices, as well as regulations affecting the products sold in such stores. The general
framework currently set out by national legislation has been further developed by regional legislation,
which has established different technical and healthcare requirements for optical retail stores for the
several autonomous regions, in order to guarantee the protection of optical health by implementing a

205


-----

quality assurance system. The quality assurance system is a broad concept under Spanish law that
refers to those aspects affecting the quality of all activities undertaken in optical retail stores.

**_Regulations governing franchise operations in Spain_**

In Spain, the legal framework that applies to franchise operations is Law 7/1996 of January 15, 1996
on the legal framework for retail trade, developed by Royal Decree 201/2010 of 26 February 2010.
Pursuant to this decree, the franchise agreement must include the following elements: (i) rights to use
a trademark or trade name by the franchisee; (ii) a uniform presentation of the points of sale; (iii) transfer
of know-how from the franchisor to the franchisee; and (iv) technical or commercial assistance services
to be provided by the franchisor to the franchisee.

The obligations of franchisees include:

## • Registration in the national registry of franchisors, provided that the franchisor is operating in
more than one autonomous region of Spain; and

## • Within a period of 20 days prior to signing a franchise agreement, the franchisor must provide
the prospective franchisee certain pre-contractual information.

The liability of the franchisor vis-à-vis third parties: such liability is restricted to the services and goods
provided by the franchisor under the franchise agreement, and the franchisor will not be responsible for
the actions of the franchisee, per Resolution 634/2021, February 23, 2021, of the Spanish Supreme
Court.

**_Regulations governing the Spanish optical and hearing aid products market_**

_Access to the optometrist-optician and audio prosthetist professions_

In Spain, optometrist-opticians are holders of optical-optometry university degrees and are thus
considered health professionals able to diagnose, treat (without the use of prescriptions) and advise on
the prevention of visual deficiencies. Audio prosthetists must hold a Higher-Level Training Cycle (Ciclo
_Formativo de Grado Superior) in audio prosthetics in order to provide advice and assist customers with_
hearing aids.

_Sales of optical and hearing aid products_

Optical and hearing aid retail stores are considered health establishments and are regulated by Royal
Decree 1277/2003, dated October 23, 2003. The Royal Decree is further complemented by regional
regulations. Pursuant to such regional regulations, the owner of an optical or hearing aid retail store is
required, among other things, to hold relevant administrative authorizations for the opening and
operation of the premises. Autonomous regions will grant such administrative authorizations, provided
that the applicant meets the personal and technical conditions required for the appropriate development
of the activity. Such authorization must be renewed periodically, generally every five years. The owner
or the legal representative of the optical retail store must apply with the relevant authorities for the
renewal at least six months before the end of the validity of the authorization. In order to alter and
relocate optical or hearing aid retail stores, the submission of an application to the relevant regional
authorities is required. In addition, any store closing needs to be communicated to the relevant
authorities. The owner of the store remains liable for the satisfaction and fulfillment of these obligations.

Optical stores must be managed by an optical-optometrist and hearing aid stores must be managed by
a hearing aid professional, who will serve as the technical director and whose presence and
performance throughout the opening hours is required. The technical director and other members of
staff must wear a badge on their clothing identifying their name and professional category. For optical
stores, the technical director is required to be registered with the National Association of OpticianOptometrists and hold a bachelor's degree in optometry or any other official degree recognized by law
for the operation of optical retail stores. For hearing aid stores, the technical director is required to be a
graduate of a degree in audio-prosthetics, audiology or have a degree in optometry plus have completed
certain training and experience requirements in audio-prosthetics. The technical director of an optical
store cannot work in more than one healthcare premise, whereas the technical director of a hearing aid
store may, in certain autonomous regions, be permitted to work in more than one healthcare premise.
Any changes or replacements of the technical director must be reported to the relevant administrative
authority and may only be replaced by another professional with similar qualifications.

206


-----

Facilities used as optical or hearing aid retail stores are required to be physically separated from any
activity that differs from the activity of a healthcare facility and shall include the following areas: (i) a
general public area; (ii) for optical stores, an optometric area for optometric functions; an assembly
area; and a product storage area; and (iii) for hearing aid stores, a dedicated consultation space
separate from the rest of the store or a soundproofed audiometry cabin in order to carry out such hearing
exams. Optical retail stores shall have certain minimum equipment which may vary depending on
whether edging of frames is carried out in conjunction with other stores.

_Prescription system_

In Spain, optometrist-opticians may prescribe optical products. Only ear, nose and throat specialists are
authorized to prescribe hearing aid products and diagnose diseases, but audio prosthetists can adapt
hearing aid products for customers. All optical retail stores must maintain and properly complete an
optical prescription registry book that may be replaced by a computerized registration system provided
that, every month, the results are recorded on paper. The personal data contained in the registry is
subject to the protection guarantees set forth by Spanish data protection law, and handled with the
same consideration as personal data relating to health. Registry entries will be supervised and signed
by the technical director and made available to the health authorities for a period of five years.

Prescription glasses, prescription contact lenses and hearing aid instruments are considered medical
devices. All medical devices sold in Spain must comply with CE marking. As medical devices they
should be adapted to each person's needs, following the relevant prescription and any specific
requirement provided by medical professionals. Due to their healthcare nature, such medical devices
cannot be sold by mail order or online. However, recent case law has expressly allowed online sales of
prescription glasses and contact lenses for "replacement products" where the client has sought the
individual prescription elsewhere and is able to provide the clinical details to the online store, per a
Spanish High Court Resolution 206/2017 on February 8, 2017 in relation to prescription glasses and
the decision of the European Union Court of Justice in Case C-108/09 on December 2, 2010 in relation
to contact lenses.

_Penalty regime_

Spanish law provides a specific penalty regime in case of non-compliance, either by action or omission,
of the requirements and obligations set forth in relation to healthcare premises. Non-observance of the
requirements may lead to fines, which may reach five times the value of the goods or services involved
in the breach, as well as to the temporary closure of the premises or the termination of the provision of
the relevant services until the problem is resolved.

_Spanish VAT rate applicable to optical products_

The reduced VAT rate of 10% currently applies to the sale of corrective lenses and contact lenses,
frames and care solutions as well as hearing aid products. The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to
the sale of sunglasses, cosmetic contact lenses, cases, and cords and chains.

**_Reimbursement of optical and hearing aid products in Spain_**

Except for the entities covered by the regime of mutual insurance of public servants (funcionarios), the
Spanish public health system generally does not cover expenditures in respect of optical or hearing aid
products, except in certain exceptional and rare instances. Private health insurance companies may
offer individual or collective vision care policies to cover expenses on optical and hearing aid products.

Optical or hearing aid expenses may be paid in full directly by the insurance company to the optical
center, in case the services or products are purchased in an optical center with which the insurance
company has entered into an agreement. In case the services or products are delivered in an optical or
hearing aid center which is not affiliated with the insurance company, a percentage (50 to 90%) of the
expenses incurred by the policyholder will be reimbursed to the policyholder by the insurance company.

Agreement within 60 days from the Issue Date.

The new revolving credit facility to be made available under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement (the "New Revolving Credit Facility") may be utilized by any current or future borrower

approved by the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of all the lenders) by the drawing of cash

be applied towards the financing or refinancing of any permitted acquisition, permitted reorganization,
capital expenditure or the working capital and general corporate purposes of the Restricted Group
(being the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries).

In addition, the Issuer may elect to request additional commitments under the New Revolving Credit
Facility Agreement (the "Additional Increase"). The total amount of such indebtedness that may be
incurred by way of Additional Increase shall not exceed €20.0 million, subject to certain conditions

unconditionally guarantees the obligations of the borrowers and each other guarantor under the New

prior to the maturity date of the New Revolving Credit Facility.

**_Interest and fees_**

Loans under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at rates per annum equal
to EURIBOR (provided that EURIBOR shall never be less than zero), plus an initial margin of 3.00%
per annum, which may be reduced by reference to the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio. The margin
on any loans under an Additional Increase will be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant lenders
(subject to the parameters as set out in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement).

Default interest is calculated as an additional 1% per annum on the overdue amount.

A commitment fee is payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of the New Revolving
Credit Facility from the Issue Date to the end of the availability period for the New Revolving Credit
Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment
fee is payable quarterly in arrears, on the last day of availability of the New Revolving Credit Facility
and on the date the New Revolving Credit Facility is cancelled in full or on the date on which the
cancellation is effective. The commitment fee in respect of any Additional Increase shall be agreed
between the Issuer and the relevant lenders (subject to the parameters as set out in the New Revolving
Credit Facility Agreement).

under the New Revolving Credit Facility;

(2) following the occurrence of a "Change of Control" (as defined in the New Revolving Credit

transaction or a series of related transactions, whereupon the New Revolving Credit Facility will

will become immediately due and payable.

**_Guarantees_**

The Guarantors will provide a senior guarantee of all amounts payable to the finance parties under the

arising under or imposed by French law (including those that relate to financial assistance, corporate

limited.

the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of such collateral and certain distressed disposals
only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations, have been repaid in full. The New Revolving
Credit Facility is also secured by certain assets of various subsidiaries of the Issuer, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles.

defease, redeem or otherwise directly or indirectly acquire or retire the principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes (or, in each case, any replacement or refinancing thereof as permitted under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement from time to time) prior to its scheduled maturity date in a manner
which involves the payment of cash consideration to a person which is not a member of the Restricted
Group. The exceptions to such covenant include (among other things) payments that do not exceed
50% of the aggregate original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes as at the Issue Date.

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires certain members of the Restricted Group
to observe certain affirmative covenants, including covenants relating to maintenance of guarantor and
security coverage, further assurances, maintenance of authorizations, compliance with laws and
sanctions, taxation, change of business, restrictions on holdings companies, preservation of assets,
acquisitions, _pari passu ranking, insurance, pensions, access, intellectual property, unrestricted_

the Issuer is required to deliver to the Facility Agent annual financial statements, quarterly financial
statements, compliance certificates and an annual budget.

**_Financial covenant_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires the Issuer to maintain a minimum EBITDA (as
defined in the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) of €58 million if, at 5 p.m. Paris time on the
last day of the relevant measurement period, the aggregate amount of all outstanding utilizations under
the New Revolving Credit Facility, any ancillary facility outstanding, and any amounts outstanding under
letters of credit, exceed 40% of the total commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility
Agreement at that time.

The Issuer is permitted to prevent or cure breaches of the minimum EBITDA (as defined in the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) covenant by amongst other things applying any cure amount
(being amounts received by the Issuer in cash pursuant to any new equity or permitted shareholder
loan) in prepayment of the New Revolving Credit Facility such that the aggregate amount of all
outstanding utilizations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, any ancillary facility outstandings, and
any amounts outstanding under letters of credit are at most 40% of the total commitments under the

215


-----

New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement at that time. No more than three cure amounts may be taken
into account during the term of the New Revolving Credit Facility and not in consecutive quarters.

**_Events of default_**

In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility contains, amongst others, the following events of default
(subject in certain cases to customary grace periods, materiality thresholds and exceptions):

  - non-payment;

  - breach of the financial covenant (subject to equity cure rights);

  - breach of other obligations;

  - litigation; or

  - an event or circumstance occurs which has a material adverse effect on the Issuer's and the
Guarantors' ability to perform their payment obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility
and the Notes (or, in each case, any refinancing thereof).

**_Governing law_**

The New Revolving Credit Facility is governed by and construed in accordance with English law
although the covenants and certain events of default, which are included in the New Revolving Credit
Facility and largely replicate those contained in the Indenture, will be interpreted in accordance with
New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the New Revolving Credit Facility is governed by English
law).

Under the New Intercreditor Agreement, all proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral and certain

**_New money and refinancing_**

The New Intercreditor Agreement contemplates that, to the extent permitted by, and subject to
compliance with the requirements of, the New Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents:

  - the Super Senior Debt Creditors may increase any Super Senior Debt and make further
advances under the Super Senior Debt Documents to members of the Group and each such
advance or increased amount will be deemed to be made under the terms of the relevant Super

notes);

  - the Issuer may incur Pari Passu Debt under a Pari Passu Debt Document;

applicable) senior basis as provided for under the New Intercreditor Agreement.

The creditors in respect of Super Senior Debt Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes
Liabilities, Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, Second Lien Debt Liabilities and Senior Debt Liabilities (together
the "Secured Parties") agree that if any Transaction Security over any asset under the applicable
Transaction Security Documents is amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified, replaced or released to ensure that the additional, increased or refinanced liabilities described
above (the "Additional Secured Liabilities") can be secured with the ranking contemplated as set out
under "—Ranking and priority" above, then the Security Agent is authorized to effect such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or release the applicable
Transaction Security Documents provided that:

220


-----

  - if an event of default under a Super Senior Debt Document (that is not to be refinanced or
replaced in whole) is continuing at that time the requisite consent under the Super Senior Debt
Document is obtained;

  - immediately upon such release of Transaction Security, new Transaction Security shall be
provided in favor of the providers of such Additional Secured Liabilities and the existing Secured
Creditors on terms substantially the same as the terms of the Transaction Security Documents
released and subject to the same ranking as set out under "—Ranking and priority" above; and

  - contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, replacement, restatement, supplement,
modification, renewal or release (followed by an immediate retaking of security of at least
equivalent ranking over the same assets) which has the effect of releasing the relevant
Transaction Security, the Issuer delivers to the Security Agent either (A) a solvency opinion
from an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent confirming the solvency of the person granting
such Transaction Security after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement or release and
retaking; (B) a certificate from the board of directors or chief financial officer of the relevant
person, which certificate confirms the solvency of the person granting such Transaction
Security after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement or release and retaking; or (C) an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Security Agent (subject
to customary exceptions and qualifications), confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification, replacement or release and retaking, the Transaction Security created under the
Transaction Security Documents so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
modified, replaced or released and retaken is valid and perfected Transaction Security not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law,
that such Transaction Security was not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification, replacement or
release and retaking.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the New Intercreditor Agreement, no Secured Party shall
be required to release any Transaction Security under the Transaction Security Documents where the
release described above may result in such Secured Party incurring any hardening period risk in respect
of any such Transaction Security if and to the extent that the relevant Additional Secured Liabilities can
be secured by lower ranking security in favor of the Secured Parties with the ranking described under
"—Ranking and priority" above by virtue of the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement.

subject of Notes Purchases made since the Closing Date (for the avoidance of

Notes as at the Closing Date (without double counting any Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities Refinancing used to refinance or replace Relevant Debt) (the

no acceleration event has occurred in respect of the Super Senior Debt Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities, the Pari Passu Debt Liabilities the Second Lien Debt Liabilities or the Senior Debt

Representative (including the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee); (iii) after the later of the Secured
Debt Discharge Date and the Second Lien Discharge Date but prior to the discharge date in respect of
the Senior Debt Liabilities (the "Senior Debt Discharge Date"), with the consent of the Senior Debt
Representative; or (iv) if that payment is made solely to facilitate payment of the Super Senior Liabilities,
Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Pari Passu Debt Liabilities, Second Lien Debt Liabilities, Senior

Agreement (i) if the payment is a scheduled payment arising under the relevant Hedging Agreement (or
another ordinary course payment under a Hedging Agreement, including any payment in relation to
fees, costs and expenses); (ii) to the extent that the relevant Debtor's obligation to make the payment
arises as a result of the operation of certain provisions relating to non-credit related close-outs under
the Hedging Agreements including, inter alia, in relation to withholding tax, payments in the contractual
currency, judgments and expenses; (iii) to the extent that the relevant Debtor's obligation to make the
payment arises as a result of the operation of a credit related close-out or a permitted automatic early

other similar officer appointed in respect of any Debtor or any of its assets.

_release—Second lien debt protection" below._

**_Manner of enforcement of Transaction Security_**

(a) The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security or taking any
other enforcement action unless instructed otherwise by either the Super Senior Debt
Required Holders or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, whichever at the relevant
time is entitled to give instructions in accordance with the terms of the New Intercreditor
Agreement as described below (each an "Instructing Group") provided _that (i) if such_
enforcement is on or after the Secured Debt Discharge Date but before the Second
Lien Debt Discharge Date, the Instructing Group shall for these purposes be the
Second Lien Debt Required Holders and (ii) if such enforcement is on or after the later
of the Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Second Lien Debt Discharge Date but
before the Senior Debt Discharge Date, the Instructing Group shall for these purposes
be the Senior Debt Required Holders.

(b) Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms:

(i) subject to the enforcement decision requirements described below, an
Instructing Group may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security
Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security as they see
fit provided that the instructions as to enforcement given by the Instructing
Group are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles (as defined
below); or

233


-----

(ii) to the extent permitted to enforce or to require the enforcement of the Senior
Debt Shared Security prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date as described
under "—Permitted senior debt and senior debt security documents
_enforcement" above and except as provided below, the Senior Debt_
Representative (acting on the instruction of the Senior Debt Required Holders)
may give instructions to the Security Agent as to the enforcement of the Senior
Debt Shared Security as they see fit.

(c) Prior to the later of the Secured Debt Discharge Date and the Second Lien Debt
Discharge Date:

(i) if the Instructing Group has instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or to
cease enforcing the Transaction Security; or

(ii) in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group,

and, in each case, the Instructing Group has not required any Debtor to make a
Distressed Disposal (as defined below), the Security Agent shall give effect to any
instructions to enforce the Senior Debt Shared Security which the Senior Debt
Representative(s) (acting on the instructions of the Majority Senior Debt Creditors) are
then entitled to give to the Security Agent as described under "—Permitted senior debt
_and senior debt security documents enforcement "._

(a) Notwithstanding the above, if at any time the Senior Debt Representative(s) are then
entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Senior Debt Shared
Security pursuant to paragraph (iii) above and the Senior Debt Representative(s) either
gives such instruction or indicates any intention to give such instruction, then:

(i) the Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the
Senior Debt Shared Security as the Instructing Group sees fit in lieu of any
instructions to enforce given by the Senior Debt Representative(s) as
described under "—Permitted senior debt and senior debt security documents
_enforcement" above; and_

(ii) if the Instructing Group gives any instructions to enforce any Transaction
Security over shares in a holding company of any member of the Group whose
shares are subject to Transaction Security with respect to which any such
enforcement instructions by a Senior Debt Representative have been given,
the Security Agent may not act on such enforcement instructions from any
Senior Debt Representative(s) unless instructed to do so by the Instructing
Group.

(b) No Secured Party shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have recourse
to any Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the
Transaction Security Documents except through the Security Agent.

If the Transaction Security is being enforced as described above, the Security Agent shall enforce the
Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of
any Debtor to be appointed by the Security Agent) as an Instructing Group (or, in the circumstances
described in paragraph (iii) above and subject to paragraph (iv) above, the Senior Debt
Representatives(s) shall instruct or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees
fit, in each case, so far as is consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles. For the avoidance of
doubt, in the absence of instructions from the Instructing Group, the Security Agent will not be required
to take any action.

**_Enforcement decisions with respect to enforcement of transaction security_**

(a) Prior to the Final Discharge Date and subject to the provisions of the New Intercreditor
Agreement described under (iii) and (iv) below, before the giving of any instructions to
the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as described under "—Manner
_of enforcement of transaction security" above (and before either the Majority Senior_
Secured Creditors or the Super Senior Debt Required Holders shall be considered the
Instructing Group), a Representative for each of the Senior Secured Creditors shall
deliver a copy of its proposed enforcement instructions to the other representatives and

234


-----

the Security Agent (including instructions not to enforce) (the "Proposed Enforcement
**Instructions"). The Security Agent shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify each**
of the representatives of the Super Senior Creditors and the Senior Secured Creditors
upon receipt of such Proposed Enforcement Instructions.

(b) Prior to the Secured Debt Discharge Date and subject to paragraphs (iii), (iv) and
(v) below, if the Security Agent has received any Proposed Enforcement Instruction, it
shall either enforce or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security in accordance
with the instructions of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors (and the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors shall be the Instructing Group for the purposes as described under
"—Manner of enforcement of transaction security" above and in each case, acting
through their respective representative), provided that such instructions are consistent
with the Security Enforcement Principles and failure to give instructions will be deemed
to be an instruction not to take enforcement steps.

(c) In the event that:

(i) from the date that is three (3) months after the first Proposed Enforcement
Instructions (including such instructions not to take enforcement steps) are
delivered to the Security Agent, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors) has not commenced the enforcement
action or either (i) the method of enforcement of Transaction Security as
determined by the Instructing Group or (ii) the appointment of a financial
advisor by the Instructing Group to assist in such determination ("Relevant
**Enforcement Action") of the Transaction Security; or**

(ii) the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six
(6) months of the date the first Proposed Enforcement Instructions (including
such instructions not to take enforcement steps) were delivered to the Security
Agent,

then (with effect from the date of the earlier to occur of such events), the Super Senior Debt Required
Holders shall become the Instructing Group for the purposes as described under "—Manner of
_enforcement of transaction security" above._

(d) If at any time the Security Agent has not taken any Relevant Enforcement Action of the
Transaction Security notwithstanding the Transaction Security having become
enforceable in accordance with its terms, a representative acting on behalf of the Super
Senior Debt Required Holders or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, may at any
time provide immediate instructions as to enforcement to the Security Agent
notwithstanding any instructions given pursuant to paragraph (ii) or (iii) above, if the
Super Senior Debt Required Holders or the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
determine in good faith (and notify the representatives of the other Super Senior
Creditors and the Senior Secured Notes Creditors and the Pari Passu Creditors and
the Security Agent) the delay in taking enforcement action of the Transaction Security
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on:

(i) the Security Agent's ability to enforce the Transaction Security; or

(ii) the realization proceeds of any enforcement of the Transaction Security,

and the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or Debtor that is the subject of
the determination set out in paragraphs (iii)(A) or (iii)(B) above, in accordance with the first such notice
of determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent (provided in each
case that such instructions are consistent with the Security Enforcement Principles).

(e) If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any Debtor (other than
an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent
acting on the instructions of the Super Senior Debt Required Holders or the Majority
Senior Secured Creditors), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Super Senior
Debt Required Holders have provided such instructions, in accordance with the
instructions received from such Super Senior Debt Required Holders, provided that in
the event the Security Agent has previously received Proposed Enforcement
Instructions from the representative for the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and has

235


-----

commenced Relevant Enforcement Action pursuant to such instructions, the Security
Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the representative for
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors until such time as the representatives for the
Super Senior Debt Required Holders issue enforcement instructions to the Security
Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such prior instructions
given by the representative for the Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

(f) Other than where paragraph (iv) or (v) above applies, if, prior to the Super Senior
Discharge Date, the Super Senior Debt Required Holders or the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors (in each case acting reasonably) consider that the Security Agent is
enforcing the security in a manner which is not consistent with the Security
Enforcement Principles, the representatives for the Super Senior Creditors, the Pari
Passu Debt Representatives or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall give notice to
the representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors, and the Pari Passu Debt
Representatives and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as appropriate) after which
the representatives for the other Super Senior Creditors, the Pari Passu Debt
Representatives and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall consult with the Security
Agent for a period of 15 days (or such lesser period as the relevant representatives
may agree) with a view to agreeing the manner of enforcement provided that such
representatives shall not be obliged to consult under this paragraph (vi) more than once
in relation to each enforcement action.

(g) After the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall either enforce or refrain
from enforcing the Transaction Security in accordance with the instructions provided
by the Majority Senior Secured Creditors.

**_Limitation on enforcement of subordinated liabilities_**

Creditors in respect of the Subordinated Liabilities will not be permitted to take any enforcement action
in respect of such liabilities prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain specific enforcement
action that is an acceleration of any liabilities, a declaration that any liability is payable on demand or a
demand in relation to any liability that is payable on demand or an exercise of rights of set-off, in each
case relating to payment of the Subordinated Liabilities which at the time of such enforcement action
would be permitted as described under "—Permitted payments" above unless, at such time, the Super
Senior Creditors, the Senior Secured Creditors, the Second Lien Debt Creditors and the Senior Debt
Creditors (the "Primary Creditors") are or the Security Agent is taking any enforcement action required
by the Instructing Group or following an Acceleration Event) save that, after the occurrence of an
insolvency event in relation to a member of the Group or any Debtor, the Subordinated Creditors may
(unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given
notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of such Subordinated Creditors in accordance with the
terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement), exercise any right it may otherwise have against that
member of the Group or any Debtor to:

(a) accelerate any of that entity's Subordinated Liabilities or declare them prematurely due
and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that entity in respect of any Subordinated Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any
Subordinated Liabilities of that entity; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that entity for the Subordinated Liabilities owing to
it.

**_Limitation on enforcement of intra-group liabilities_**

The Intra-Group Lenders will not be permitted to take any enforcement action in respect of the IntraGroup Liabilities at any time prior to the Final Discharge Date (other than certain specific enforcement
action that is an acceleration of any liabilities, a declaration that any liability is payable on demand or a
demand in relation to any liability that is payable on demand or an exercise of rights of set-off, in each
case relating to payment of the Intra-Group Liabilities which at the time of such enforcement action
would be permitted as described under "—Permitted payments" above) unless, at such time, an
Instructing Group is taking enforcement action or following an Acceleration Event, save that, after the

236


-----

occurrence of an insolvency event in relation to any member of the Group, each Intra-Group Lender
may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has
given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Intra-Group Lender in accordance with the
New Intercreditor Agreement) exercise any right it may otherwise have against that member of the
Group to:

(a) accelerate any of that member of the Group's Intra-Group Liabilities or declare them
prematurely due and payable or payable on demand;

(b) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given
by that member of the Group in respect of any Intra-Group Liabilities;

(c) exercise any right of set-off or take or receive any payment in respect of any IntraGroup Liabilities of that member of the Group; or

(d) claim and prove in the liquidation of that member of the Group for the Intra-Group
Liabilities owing to it.

**_Security enforcement principles_**

The New Intercreditor Agreement shall provide for enforcement instructions in relation to the
Transaction Security to be consistent with the following security enforcement principles (the "Security
**Enforcement Principles"):**

(a) it shall be the primary and overriding aim of any enforcement of the Transaction
Security to achieve the objective of maximizing the recovery of the Secured Parties, to
the extent consistent with (i) a prompt and expeditious enforcement of the Transaction
Security (to the extent reasonably possible) and (ii) the rights and obligations of the
Security Agent under the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement and under
applicable law (the "Security Enforcement Objective");

(b) the Security Enforcement Principles may be amended, varied or waived with the prior
written consent of the Super Senior Debt Required Holders, the Majority Senior
Secured Creditors, the Senior Secured Noteholders, the holders of each tranche of
Pari Passu Debt, the holders of each tranche of Second Lien Debt and the Security
Agent;

(c) except in the case of a Foreclosure, the Transaction Security will be enforced and other
action as to enforcement will be taken such that either:

(i) all proceeds of enforcement are received by the Security Agent in cash for
distribution in accordance with the payment waterfall described in "—
_Application of proceeds" below; or_

(ii) (except in the case of any enforcement which is instructed by the Super Senior
Debt Required Holders) sufficient proceeds from enforcement will be received
by the Security Agent in cash to ensure that when the proceeds are applied in
accordance with the payment waterfall described in "—Application of
_proceeds" below, the Super Senior Liabilities are repaid and discharged in full_
(unless the Super Senior Debt Required Holders agree otherwise);

(d) any Exit Disposal (as defined below) may only be effected upon the instructions of an
Instructing Group and in accordance with these Security Enforcement Principles as if
such Exit Disposal was an enforcement of Transaction Security;

(e) the enforcement action must be prompt and expeditious it being acknowledged that,
subject to the other provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement, the timeframe for
the realization of value from the enforcement of the Transaction Security or Distressed
Disposal (as defined below) or Exit Disposal pursuant to enforcement will be
determined by the Instructing Group _provided that it is consistent with the Security_
Enforcement Objective;

(f) on (i) a proposed enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over assets other
than shares in a member of the Group, where the aggregate book value of such assets
exceeds €5,000,000 (or its equivalent in other currencies) or (ii) a proposed

237


-----

enforcement of any of the Transaction Security over some or all of the shares in a
member of the Group over which Transaction Security exists, the Security Agent shall
if requested by the Super Senior Debt Required Holders or the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, and at the expense of the Issuer, (to the extent that financial advisers have
not adopted a general policy of not providing such opinions) appoint a financial adviser
to opine:

(i) that the consideration received for any disposal is fair from a financial point of
view taking into account all relevant circumstances;

(ii) on the optimal method of enforcing the Transaction Security so as to achieve
the Security Enforcement Principles and maximize the recovery of any such
enforcement action; and

(iii) that such sale is otherwise in accordance with the Security Enforcement
Objective,

(the "Financial Adviser's Opinion") provided that, if the Security Agent is unable to obtain an opinion
from a financial adviser covering the matters set out under (B) and (C) above (and after considering
making such modifications to the enforcement process as may be reasonably available and consistent
with the Security Enforcement Principles to obtain such opinion), then an opinion covering paragraph
(A) above shall be sufficient to constitute a Financial Adviser's Opinion for the purposes of the Security
Enforcement Principles;

(h) the Security Agent shall be under no obligation to appoint a financial adviser or to seek
the advice of a financial adviser, unless expressly required to do so by these Security
Enforcement Principles or any other provision of the New Intercreditor Agreement. Prior
to making any appointment of a financial adviser, the Security Agent is entitled to
ensure that cost cover (at a level it is satisfied with acting reasonably) has been
provided;

(i) the Financial Adviser's Opinion (or any equivalent opinion obtained by the Security
Agent in relation to any other enforcement of the Transaction Security that such action
is fair from a financial point of view after taking into account all relevant circumstances)
will be conclusive evidence that the Security Enforcement Objective has been met;

(j) in the absence of written notice from a creditor or group of creditors that are not part of
the relevant Instructing Group that such creditor(s) object to any enforcement of the
Transaction Security on the grounds that such enforcement action does not aim to
achieve the Security Enforcement Objective, the Security Agent is entitled to assume
that such enforcement of the Transaction Security is in accordance with the Security
Enforcement Objective;

(k) if the Security Agent is unable to obtain a Financial Adviser's Opinion after attempting
to do so (and after considering making such modifications to the enforcement process
as may be reasonably available and consistent with the Security Enforcement
Principles to obtain such opinion) because such opinions are not generally available in
the market in such circumstances it shall notify each Super Senior Debt Representative
and each representative in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities or Pari
Passu Debt or Second Lien Debt and may proceed to enforce the Transaction Security
without needing to demonstrate (by way of a Financial Adviser's Opinion or otherwise)
that such enforcement is aiming to achieve the Security Enforcement Objective; and

(l) if enforcement of any Transaction Security is conducted by way of a public auction or
other competitive sales process specified in the New Intercreditor Agreement, no
financial adviser shall be required to be appointed, and no Financial Adviser's Opinion
shall be required, in relation to such enforcement provided that the Security Agent shall
be entitled (but not obliged) to appoint a financial adviser to provide such advice as the
Security Agent deems appropriate in relation to such enforcement by way of public
auction or other competitive sale process in accordance with the New Intercreditor
Agreement.

Parties SPV receives or recovers (in the case of a Super Senior Creditor or Senior Secured Creditor
only in respect of the fourth paragraph below):

  - any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any liability owed by a member

application of such amount in accordance with the order of priority described under "—
_Application of proceeds" below), any amount by way of set-off in respect of any liability owed_
by a member of the Group under the Debt Documents which does not give effect to a permitted
payment under the New Intercreditor Agreement as described under "—Permitted payments"
above;

-----

in respect of such Debtor), or (ii) by way of set-off in respect of any liability of a member of the
Group under the Debt Documents after the occurrence of a Distress Event;

then that Creditor (or Secured Parties SPV as the case may be):

amount on trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay that amount to the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement; and

pay an amount equal to that receipt or recovery to the Security Agent for application in

Holders (as defined below) in respect of the Foreclosed Assets or Investment Instruments issued by a

connection with a liquidation or a winding-up of a Secured Parties SPV) and (b) all proceeds received
in cash by Foreclosed Assets Holders as a result of an Exit Disposal, in each case before deducting
any liabilities for taxes incurred and required to be paid by Foreclosed Assets Holders in connection
with those distributions but, in the case of either a sale of Foreclosed Assets by a Secured Parties SPV
or a sale of shares in any entity which is a subsidiary of any Debtor whose Investment Instruments are
the object of a Foreclosure or the Secured Parties SPV, after deducting any taxes payable by the seller.

**_Deferral of subrogation rights_**

If any liabilities owed by a Debtor under the Debt Documents to the Secured Creditors ("Secured
**Creditor Liabilities") or any liabilities owed by the Issuer and the Debtors to the Second Lien Debt**
Creditors under the Second Lien Debt Documents ("Second Lien Liabilities") are wholly or partly paid
out of any proceeds received in respect of or on account of the Senior Debt Liabilities owing to one or
more Senior Debt Creditors, those Senior Debt Creditors will to that extent be subrogated to the Secured
Creditor Liabilities or, as the case may be, the Second Lien Liabilities so paid (and all securities and
guarantees for those Secured Creditor Liabilities).

To the extent that a Senior Debt Creditor (a "Subrogated Creditor") is entitled to exercise rights of
subrogation, each other Creditor (subject in each case to it being indemnified, secured and/or prefunded
to its satisfaction against any resulting costs, expenses and liabilities) will give such assistance to
enable such rights so to be exercised as such Subrogated Creditor may reasonably request.

No Creditor, Subordinated Party or Debtor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of the
performance by it of its obligations under the Debt Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part
and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of any
Creditor which ranks ahead of it in accordance with the priorities set out in the New Intercreditor
Agreement as described above under "—Ranking and priority") until such time as all of the liabilities
owing by a member of the Group under the Debt Documents to each prior ranking Creditor (or, in the
case of any Debtor prior to the Final Discharge Date, owing to each Creditor) have been irrevocably
paid in full.

No Subordinated Creditor will exercise any rights which it may have to take the benefit (in whole or in
part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights under the Debt Documents of any
Creditor until such time as all of the liabilities owing by a member of the Group under the Debt
Documents to each Creditor (other than a Subordinated Creditor) have been irrevocably paid in full.

**_Assignment of recourse rights_**

"Recourse Rights" means any and all rights (including accessory rights such as security interests),
actions and claims that any member of the Group, any guarantor or any Debtor which has granted any
Transaction Security or a guarantee in order to secure or guarantee all or part of the secured obligations
may have against any other person (whether a Debtor or not), in each case as a result of an
enforcement action of any Transaction Security, enforcement of that guarantee or otherwise as a result
of the payment of such secured obligations in lieu of such other person, and including any right to be
repaid by, to receive any amount from or to be indemnified by, that other person (whether prior to or
after enforcement), any right of recourse by way of subrogation, _recours subrogatoire, recours_
_personnel, contribution or any other similar right, action or claim under any applicable law, whether such_
right arises by law, contract or otherwise.

Each member of the Group and each Debtor irrevocably and unconditionally assigns under the New

**_Release of the guarantees and the security_**

_Distressed disposals_

The New Intercreditor Agreement provides that in relation to the disposal of an asset of a member of
any Debtor which is subject to Transaction Security and which is being effected: at the request of an
Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; by
enforcement, or simultaneous with the enforcement, of the Transaction Security; or after the occurrence
of a Distress Event by or on behalf of a Debtor to a person outside of the Group (a "Distressed
**Disposal"), an Exit Disposal or a Foreclosure, the Security Agent is authorized to (i) release the**
Transaction Security or any other claim (including any Assigned Recourse Rights) over the relevant
asset; (ii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release that Debtor and
any of its subsidiaries from all or any part of its liabilities in its capacity as a guarantor or a borrower
(and certain other liabilities) under the Super Senior Debt Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents,
the Senior Secured Notes Finance Documents, the Second Lien Debt Documents or the Senior Debt
Documents and to release any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any of its subsidiaries
over any of its assets and to release any other claim of a Subordinated Creditor, an Intra-Group Lender
or another Debtor or other grantor of Transaction Security over that Debtor's assets or over the assets
of any of its subsidiaries; (iii) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a holding company
of a Debtor, to release that holding company and any of its subsidiaries from all or any part of their
liabilities in their capacity as a guarantor or a borrower (and certain other liabilities) under the Super
Senior Debt Documents, the Pari Passu Debt Documents, the Senior Secured Notes Finance
Documents, the Second Lien Debt Documents or the Senior Debt Documents, and to release any

and to release any other claims of a Subordinated Creditor, an Intra-Group Lender or another Debtor
over the assets of that holding company or any of its subsidiaries; (iv) if the relevant asset consists of
shares in the capital of a Debtor or holding company of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to
dispose to another entity all or any part of the liabilities of that first Debtor or holding company or any
subsidiaries of that first Debtor or holding company, then the Security Agent shall enter into any relevant

244


-----

documentation provided that, if it is intended that the transferee Debtor should not be a Primary Creditor
or secured party, the transferee Debtor shall not be treated as a Primary Creditor or secured party, and
if it is intended that the transferee Debtor should be a Primary Creditor or secured party, then all (and
not part) of the liabilities owed to Primary Creditors, and all or part of any other liabilities should be
disposed; and (v) if the relevant asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or holding company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent decides to transfer to another Debtor all or any part of the first
Debtor's obligations or any obligations of any subsidiary of that first Debtor in respect of liabilities owed
to a Debtor, Intra-Group Liabilities or Subordinated Liabilities, transfer all or part of such obligations on
behalf of the person to which they are owed and accept the transfer of those obligations on behalf of
the transferee Debtor.

_The Security Agent must take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market_
conditions and apply the proceeds of such disposal in accordance with "—Application of proceeds"
above.

_Non-distressed disposals_

In addition, if (a) a disposal relates to an asset of a Debtor (other than in respect of any assets subject
to any Transaction Security granted by the Issuer), (b) subject to certification requirements, that
disposal is not prohibited by or permitted under respectively (prior to the Super Senior Debt Discharge
Date) the Super Senior Debt Documents, (prior to the Senior Secured Notes Discharge Date) the Senior
Secured Notes Finance Documents or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee authorizes that release, (prior
to the Pari Passu Debt Discharge Date) the Pari Passu Debt Documents, (prior to the Second Lien Debt
Discharge Date) the Second Lien Debt Documents and (prior to the Senior Debt Discharge Date) the
Senior Debt Documents or the Senior Debt Representative(s) authorizes that release and (c) that
disposal is not a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorized and obliged, at the
cost of the relevant Debtor or the Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further
confirmation from any other party to the New Intercreditor Agreement, (i) to release (or procure that any
other relevant person releases) the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt
Document) over that asset, (ii) where that asset consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor, to release
the Transaction Security or any other claim (relating to a Debt Document) over that Debtor's assets,
and, to the extent that they are at such time being disposed of, the assets of any subsidiary of that
Debtor and, to the extent that they are at such time being disposed of, the subsidiaries of that Debtor
and their respective assets, and (iii) to execute and deliver or enter into any release of the Transaction
Security or any claim described in (i) and (ii) above and issue any certificates of non-crystallization of
any floating charge or any consent to dealing that the Security Agent (acting reasonably) considers to
be necessary or desirable.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Debt Document, nothing in any Security Document shall
operate or be construed so as to prevent any transaction, matter or other step not prohibited by the
terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Debt Financing Agreement (a "Permitted
**Transaction"). The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the Secured Parties) will (and is irrevocably**
authorized and instructed to do so without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any party to the New Intercreditor Agreement) that it shall (at the request and cost of the relevant Debtor
or the Issuer) promptly execute any release or other document and/or take such other action under or
in relation to any Debt Document (or any asset subject or expressed to be subject to any Security
Document) as is requested by the Issuer in order to complete, implement or facilitate a Permitted
Transaction.

released and discharged concurrently with such sale (and are not assumed by
the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all security under the Security

**_Amendment_**

Subject to certain exceptions, usual disenfranchisement provisions and customary "snooze you lose"
provisions (under which creditors may lose their right to vote if they delay doing so within 10 business
days), the New Intercreditor Agreement provides that it may only be amended with the consent of the
Issuer, the Super Senior Debt Required Holders, the requisite majority of Pari Passu Creditors, the
Second Lien Debt Required Holders, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee, each Senior Debt Representative and the Security Agent unless (i) such amendments are
made to cure defects or omissions, resolve ambiguities or inconsistencies or reflect changes of a minor,
technical or administrative nature or as otherwise prescribed by the relevant Debt Documents, which
amendments may be made by the Issuer and the Security Agent or (ii) such amendments are made to
meet the requirements of any person proposing to act as a creditor representative which are customary
for persons acting in such capacity and would not have a material adverse effect on the other parties
to the New Intercreditor Agreement, which amendments may be made by the Issuer and the Security
Agent. No amendment or waiver of the New Intercreditor Agreement may impose new or additional
obligations on or withdraw or reduce the rights of any party to the New Intercreditor Agreement without
their prior consent other than, in the case of a Primary Creditor, in a way which affects or would affect
Primary Creditors of that party's class generally or, in the case of a Debtor, to the extent consented to
by the Issuer.

An amendment or waiver to the New Intercreditor Agreement that relates to, inter alia, certain of the
matters described under "—Manner of enforcement of transaction security" and "—Security
_enforcement principles" and to the Security Enforcement Principles may be made by the Super Senior_
Debt Required Holders and the Majority Senior Secured Creditors acting through the relevant
representative.

The Security Agent may amend the terms of, waive any of the requirements of, or grant consents under,
any of the Transaction Security Documents acting on the instructions of each representative of creditors
that are secured by the relevant Transaction Security Documents, with the consent of the Issuer, unless
provided otherwise under the relevant documents.

**_Governing law_**

The New Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law.

**Shareholder Bonds**

In connection with the acquisition of the Group by the current shareholders on July 17, 2012, the Issuer
issued €203.3 million aggregate principal amount of convertible bonds to Lion / Seneca Lux 2 and
Holding AA-OC S.à r.l., which were convertible into common shares and category D preferred shares
of the Issuer. The Issuer convertible bonds which were convertible into category D preferred shares
were fully reimbursed on July 31, 2019. The Shareholder Bonds bear interest at a fixed rate of 14.0%
per annum, which is capitalized on July 31 of each year and payable in full on the maturity date, July
17, 2027. As of January 31, 2021, €299.9 million, including principal and accrued and unpaid interest,
was outstanding under the Shareholder Bonds.

On or prior to the Issue Date, €135.0 million of the Shareholder Bonds will be repaid by the Issuer to its
shareholders in connection with the partial repayment of the Shareholder Bonds. As of January 31,
2021, as adjusted for the Transactions, €157.8 million of the Shareholder Bonds (€164.9 million
including accrued interest) remained outstanding.

**Assignment of Accounts Receivable**

We use Dailly assignments (cessions Dailly), which is a simplified form of assignment of receivables
under French law, to assign certain accounts receivable to financial institutions in exchange for the
extension of cash advances by such financial institutions. Pursuant to such assignments, franchisees
make direct payments on the accounts receivable to the financial institution. If the relevant franchisee
has not made payment in full on the accounts receivable by the relevant date, we are required to pay
the difference between the amount assigned and the amount already paid to the financial institution by
such franchisee. In the six months ended January 31, 2021, these lines were unutilized. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity
_and capital resources—Off-balance sheet commitments"._

**Guarantee Facilities**

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is party to a number of off-balance sheet guarantee framework agreements
with financial institutions (the "Guarantee Facilities") pursuant to which it has procured financing
facilities making term loans available to franchisees guaranteed by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur up to a
certain amount (referred to as a "bill"). This arrangement facilitates access to credit for franchisees. We
also assist franchisees in collecting and preparing the necessary documentation to obtain the loan,
although the relevant financial institution is responsible for credit approval. Depending on the particular
arrangement, funds borrowed under the guarantee facilities can be used by our franchisees for working
capital or capital expenditure purposes. The guarantees provided thereunder make Alain Afflelou
Franchiseur jointly and severally liable for debt incurred by the relevant franchisees, with our total
aggregate commitment capped at a certain amount. The guarantee facilities do not oblige the relevant
financial institution to approve any loan applications by franchisees. Our most significant guarantee
facilities are only available to our franchisees located in metropolitan France and expressly exclude our
directly-owned stores. Our guarantee facilities are governed by French law. As of January 31, 2021,
securities and bank guarantees granted to banks financing franchisees in France and Spain totaled
€15.0 million.

and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and your rights because they, and not this summary, define
your rights as Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Copies of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
form of Senior Secured Notes and the New Intercreditor Agreement are available as set forth under
"Listing and General Information".

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**GENERAL**

**The Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be general senior secured obligations of the Issuer;

  - be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, subject to the
limitations described in "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity
_and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests";_

  - be secured as set forth below under _"—Security" along with obligations under the New_
Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future
indebtedness; however, Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after
any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future
indebtedness, have been repaid in full;

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior
Subordinated Notes;

250


-----

  - rank _pari passu in right of payment among themselves and with any existing and future_
indebtedness of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes, including the obligations of the Issuer under the New Revolving Credit Facility,
and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations;

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the
Issuer that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors and existing and future of indebtedness
of Senior Secured Notes Guarantors in excess of the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes
guaranteed by such Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, including obligations owed to trade
creditors and, to the extent drawings are borrowed by such non-Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor subsidiaries, obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility; and

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent of the value
of such property and assets securing such indebtedness.

**The Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

The Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (the "Senior Secured Notes
_Guarantees") (i) on the Issue Date by 3AB Optique Développement and Alain Afflelou Franchiseur (the_
"Issue Date Senior Secured Notes Guarantors") and (ii) within 60 days of the Issue Date, by Alain
Afflelou International, 3ABOE, LSFA and L'Opticien Afflelou (the "Post-Issue Date Senior Secured
_Notes Guarantors" and, together with the Issue Date Guarantors, the "Senior Secured Notes_
_Guarantors")._

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be a general senior obligation of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor that granted such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee;

  - be secured by first-priority liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral of that Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor as described below under "—Security" along with obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other
future indebtedness; however, Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after
any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other
future indebtedness, have been repaid in full;

  - rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee, including its obligations under its Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee;

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee, including its obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
certain Hedging Obligations, if any;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor that is secured by property or assets other than the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral of that Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such property
and assets, including the equipment and other assets securing that Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor's lease obligations; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Subsidiaries of that
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (other than Subsidiaries that are or that become Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors), including obligations owed to trade creditors, bilateral facilities
and, to the extent drawings are borrowed by such non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantors
subsidiaries, obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

The obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will be contractually limited under the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws_
_and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral" and "Certain_

251


-----

_Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests". In particular, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes_
Guarantors incorporated in France will be limited to the outstanding amounts under the proceeds loans
extended, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor using the proceeds of
the Senior Secured Notes. Only 3AB Optique Développement, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur and L'Opticien
Afflelou will receive proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes, and these proceeds loans will represent
only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes. In certain cases, these
limitations may apply to the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, but not the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors' obligations under other debt, including the New Revolving Credit Facility. For the twelve
months ended January 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors generated
75.5% of our revenue, 89.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA and as of January 31, 2021, constituted 89.4%
of our total assets (in each case gross of intercompany balances and consolidation eliminations).

Pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, after an acceleration event in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility or other debt subject to the New Intercreditor
Agreement, neither the Issuer nor the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors may make payments in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees except in connection with the
realization or enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral or a transaction in lieu of such
enforcement or all amounts turned over to the Security Agent as described under "Description of Certain
_Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement", in which case such_
payments will be applied in respect of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging
Obligations, if any, and certain other future indebtedness until such obligations are repaid in full prior to
the repayment of the Senior Secured Notes. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other
_Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

**Principal and maturity**

The Issuer will issue €410.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue
Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on     , 2026. The Senior Secured Notes will be issued
in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

_Interest on the Senior Secured Notes_

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of     % per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will:

accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each      and     , commencing on      ,
2021;

be payable to the Holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day immediately
preceding the related interest payment date (except for Definitive Registered Notes, if any are
issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, which will have a record date of 15 days
prior to any interest payment date as further described under "—Transfer and Exchange"); and

be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

_Payments of Interest on the Senior Secured Notes_

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Secured Notes to receive the payments of
interest on such Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear Bank SA/NV
("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking S.A. ("Clearstream"). If the due date for any payment in respect
of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be
paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

**Methods of receiving payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at the specified office or
agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Senior Secured
Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a nominee of

252


-----

Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on any certificated securities ("Definitive Registered Notes") will
be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the United Kingdom. In
addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled
thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "—Paying Agent and Registrar
_for the Senior Secured Notes"._

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes, including in the
United Kingdom. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") with offices in Ireland. The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The initial transfer agent will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes, if issued, outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Upon demand by the Issuer,
the Registrar shall (at the expense of the Issuer) send a copy of the register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time maintained by it to the Issuer and the Issuer
shall keep such copy of the register at its registered office.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to
the Holders. For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin
and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require,
the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a
newspaper having a general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of Euronext
Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin).

**Transfer and exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form
without interest coupons attached, as follows:

Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"). The 144A Global
Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the "Global Notes"). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer
_restrictions". In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the "144A Book-Entry Interests") may be transferred to
a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
"Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in
accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

253


-----

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a
Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of
Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the
transfer restrictions described under "Transfer restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable
securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and
after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer
in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions
on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer restrictions".

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof to Persons who take
delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to,
among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information
regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish
certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any Taxes payable
in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Senior Secured Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured Notes
to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Security Agent, the Registrar and
any transfer agent will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note as the owner
of it for all purposes.

To the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Issuer will make each interest payment
to the Holders of record of such Definitive Registered Notes on the date that is 15 days prior to any
such interest payment date.

**ADDITIONAL SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer's compliance with the covenants described under the headings
"—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" and "—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens",
the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Senior Secured Notes ("Additional Senior Secured Notes"),
which shall have the terms set out in an Officer's Certificate supplied to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee. Such Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated, along with all other series of Senior
Secured Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture with respect
to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series;
_provided that Additional Senior Secured Notes will not be issued with the same CUSIP, ISIN or common_

254


-----

code, as applicable, as existing Senior Secured Notes unless such Additional Senior Secured Notes
are fungible with the existing Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Issuer's
sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer's Certificate may include provisions pertaining to the
redemption of such Additional Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to,
any special mandatory redemption in the event that the release from any escrow into which proceeds
of the issuance of such Additional Senior Secured Notes are deposited is conditioned on the
consummation of any acquisition, Investment, refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a
"Special Mandatory Redemption"). In addition, such Officer's Certificate may include provisions
pursuant to which such Additional Senior Secured Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN
or common code pending the satisfaction of certain conditions, such as the consummation of an
acquisition, and such Additional Senior Secured Notes bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common
code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional Senior Secured Notes bearing the same ISIN
or common code as the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date; provided that such Additional
Senior Secured Notes are fungible with the Senior Secured Notes issued on the relevant issue date for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and this Description of the Senior Secured Notes, references to "Senior
Secured Notes" shall be deemed to include references to the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on
the Issue Date as well as any Additional Senior Secured Notes.

**RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES AND UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's direct and indirect Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In
the circumstances described below under "—Certain definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary", the Issuer
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes.

**SENIOR SECURED NOTES GUARANTEES**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes will be Guaranteed by each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. These Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors. Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is a full and unconditional Guarantee of the Issuer's
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, subject to the contractual limitations discussed below.

The obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will be contractually limited under the
applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law and the Agreed
Security Principles with respect to, among other things, maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference or conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such
contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests"._

Not all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Senior Secured Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of any of these non-Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders of
their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Issuer.

As the Issuer has limited assets of its own other than its shares in its Subsidiaries, the Issuer is
dependent upon its Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Senior
Secured Notes. The operations of the Issuer are conducted primarily through its Subsidiaries and
therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of such Subsidiaries to possess adequate cash to ensure
it can meet its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and
other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer's nonSenior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiaries upon that
non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation, winding up or reorganization (and the
consequent right of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes to participate in those assets) will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiary's
creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is itself
recognized as a creditor of the non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the
claims of the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be

255


-----

subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-Senior Secured Notes Guarantor Subsidiary
senior to that held by the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated_
_to the liabilities of the Issuer's non-guarantor subsidiaries"._

**Subsequent Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

The Issuer may from time to time designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an additional guarantor of the
Senior Secured Notes (an "Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor") by causing it to execute and
deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will become a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor.

Each Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will, jointly and severally with the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors and each other Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, irrevocably Guarantee
(each Guarantee, an "Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee"), as primary obligor and not merely
as surety, on a senior basis the full and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, whether for payment of principal of, or interest on or in respect
of, the Senior Secured Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. The obligations of any
Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will be contractually limited under its Additional Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee to reflect limitations under applicable law and the Agreed Security Principles,
including restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be
restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, "thin capitalization" rules, maintenance of share capital, retention of title
claims and similar principles applicable to such Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and its
shareholders, directors and general partner. Any Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee shall be
issued on substantially the same terms as the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (subject to the
foregoing contractual limitations). For purposes of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and this
Description of the Senior Secured Notes, references to the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees include
references to any Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and references to the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors include references to any Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantors.

**Releases**

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (except for the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of 3AB
Optique Développement) will be released:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock
of the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the "—
_Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below and such that the relevant_
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor no longer remains a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) in connection with any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate
the "—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of such Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in "—Defeasance"
and "—Satisfaction and discharge";

(5) in accordance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement relating to the release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee on an
enforcement sale or other disposal of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(6) as described under "—Amendments and waivers";

(7) with respect to an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee given under the "—Additional
_Senior Secured Notes Guarantees" covenant below, upon release of the Senior Secured Notes_

256


-----

Guarantee that gave rise to the requirement to issue such Additional Senior Secured Notes
Guarantee so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no other Indebtedness
that would give rise to an obligation to give an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is
at that time Guaranteed by the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(8) with respect to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor which is not the continuing or surviving
Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a Permitted Reorganization or a
transaction permitted by the "—Merger and consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes
_Guarantors" covenant below and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; or_

(9) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes.

The Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of 3AB Optique Développement will be released upon the
occurrence of any event described in clauses (4), (5), (6), (8) or (9) above.

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall, subject to receipt of
certain documents from the Issuer and/or Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, and subject to the terms
of the New Intercreditor Agreement, each take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the
Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the New Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee without the consent of
the Holders or any action on the part of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee. Neither the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Senior Secured Notes to reflect
any such release, termination or discharge.

**SECURITY**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by shared firstranking security interests (A) as of the Issue Date, over collateral consisting of (i) pledges of certain
securities accounts relating to all securities issued by or held in 3AB Optique Développement, Alain
Afflelou Franchiseur, L'Opticien Afflelou, 3ABOE and Lion / Seneca France Audio, (ii) pledges of certain
bank accounts of the Issuer and the Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors and (iii) pledges
of certain intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer and the Issue Date Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors (collectively, the "Issue Date Senior Secured Notes Collateral") and (B) within 60 days of
the Issue Date, over collateral consisting of (i) all shares issued by or held in Alain Afflelou International
and (ii) pledges of certain bank accounts of the Post-Issue Date Senior Secured Notes Guarantors
(collectively, the "Post-Issue Date Senior Secured Notes Collateral" and, together with the Issue Date
Senior Secured Notes Collateral, the "Senior Secured Notes Collateral"), along with obligations under
the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations. However, pursuant to the
New Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after any
obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and certain Hedging Obligations and, if any, certain other Indebtedness, have been repaid in
full.

The liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively as the "Security Interest". Any other
property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted to secure obligations under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute "Senior
Secured Notes Collateral".

The Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable
law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to security providers and their shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency Law
_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests". The grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles._
The Agreed Security Principles provide that certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not
perfected), including:

257


-----

if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders;

if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will
be subject to security;

if providing such security would require consent of any person, subject to certain obligations to take
steps to obtain such consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such
security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend to the material
detriment of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require
any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain
conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

if providing such security (i) would be prohibited by statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, transfer pricing rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (after the use of reasonable endeavors to
overcome the relevant legal limitation, if possible), (ii) would be outside the applicable pledgor's
capacity or conflict with its fiduciary duties, or (iii) could result in any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or shareholders;

if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets; and

no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is not
located but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor in relation to security granted by another Senior Secured Notes Guarantor located
in a different jurisdiction and (where otherwise consistent with the Agreed Security Principles)
in any supranational registries agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent from time to
time.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be interpreted and applied
in good faith by the Issuer.

The Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will also
secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, the Senior Subordinated Notes on a second-priority
basis and certain other future Indebtedness; provided, however, that Holders of the Senior Secured
Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and certain
distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations
under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations or certain other future
Indebtedness, have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance
with the "—Impairment of Security Interest" covenant below, each of the Issuer and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors is permitted to pledge the Senior Secured Notes Collateral in connection with future
Incurrences of Indebtedness, including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, in each case, permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and other Indebtedness of members of the Group and on
terms consistent with the relative priority in right of payment of such Indebtedness under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by
operation of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or
discharge of the Senior Secured Notes as provided in "—Defeasance" or _"—Satisfaction and_
_discharge", in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture.

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be
reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior Secured
Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, subject to the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. No appraisals of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior Secured Notes. By its nature, some or all
of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market
value. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of

258


-----

time, or at all. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The
_value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_
_and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances" and "Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the_
_Collateral securing the Notes". In addition, the New Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the_
ability of the Security Agent to release the Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other
creditors. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation.
See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor
_Agreement"._

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, as the case may be, will have
the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in
respect of the shares that are part of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, will be entitled to exercise
any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating
dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights
issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations
secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, if any, and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee have,
and by accepting a Senior Secured Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed
the Security Agent to act as its agent and security agent under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the New Revolving
Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral, if any, and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Secured Note,
each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties
and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the New
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and
discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or
replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

Further, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Senior
Secured Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the New
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or
entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein). See "Description of Certain Other
_Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will grant security
over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the obligations of the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, _inter alios, the relevant security_
provider and the Security Agent.

The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under
the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, (who
will have the equal and ratable benefit of the same Senior Secured Notes Collateral) and the holders of
the Senior Subordinated Notes issued pursuant to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture (as defined
in "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes"). The Security Agent will also act on behalf of certain
future secured creditors.

The Security Documents provide that the rights with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral
must be exercised by the Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders
are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act
through the Security Agent.

259


-----

The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents
that is in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement
without requiring any consent of the Holders. See _"—Release of Liens" and "Risk Factors—Risks_
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than_
_repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees_
_will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without_
_your consent or the consent of the Trustee". In addition, the terms of the Security Documents_
themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without
need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge, or the exclusion of
certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example,
assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). The Security
Agent will commence enforcement action under the Security Documents only in accordance with the
terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement. See "—Enforcement of Security Interest".

In the event that the Issuer or any of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors enters into insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, gestion controlée, liquidation judiciaire, faillite déclarée or similar proceedings,
the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the New Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity
of the Security Interest or the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders
might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws_
_and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral"._

**Release of Liens**

The Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will be entitled, in addition to the circumstances
described above, to require the Security Agent to release the Security Interest in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in the case of Senior Secured Notes Collateral owned by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
of the Issuer, in connection with any sale or disposition of such property or assets to (a) any
Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary either before or after giving effect to
such transaction, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the "—Limitation on sales of
_assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below or (b) to the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes_
Guarantor; _provided_ that such transfer is otherwise in compliance with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and, in the case of clause (b), immediately following such sale or disposition,
a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets or property exists or is granted in
favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
for the Holders);

(2) in connection with the release of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor from its Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of
the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor;

(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release
of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and discharge";

(5) in compliance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement relating to disposals of assets subject to security (see "Description of
_Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement");_

(6) (i) in accordance with "—Amendments and waivers", (ii) in accordance with the "—Impairment
_of Security Interest" covenant below and (iii) in accordance with the second paragraph under_
the "—Limitation on Liens" covenant below so long as immediately after the release there is no
other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the property or assets that was the subject of the
Initial Lien that would result in the requirement for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

260


-----

(7) in order to effectuate a Permitted Reorganization or a merger, consolidation, conveyance or
transfer conducted in compliance with the "—Merger and consolidation" covenant below;
_provided that following such Permitted Reorganization or merger, consolidation, conveyance or_
transfer, a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets or property is granted in
favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
for the Holders) to the extent such assets or property continue to exist as assets or property of
the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(8) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes; or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

The Security Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (only if required) will take all necessary
action reasonably requested by the Issuer required to effectuate any release of Senior Secured Notes
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, in accordance
with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Documents. Each of the releases set forth
above shall be permitted to be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any
action on the part of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

**Enforcement of Security Interest**

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce any Security Interest is restricted by the terms of the New
Intercreditor Agreement by reference to the interests of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations. See "Description of Certain Other
_Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement". It may also be restricted by_
similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured by the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement.

Similar provisions may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance
with the "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" covenant below.

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors under our financing arrangements, including, without limitation, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Subordinated Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging
Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors, the agent under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
trustee under the Senior Subordinated Indenture and the Security Agent will enter into the New
Intercreditor Agreement. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—
_New Intercreditor Agreement". Pursuant to the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement, any liabilities_
in respect of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and any Credit Facilities Incurred
pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant below,
any Hedging Obligations Incurred pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation
_on Indebtedness" covenant below and any liabilities in respect of obligations Incurred pursuant to clause_
(7) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant below and permitted to be
secured on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (see "—Certain definitions—Permitted Collateral
_Liens") will receive priority with respect to any proceeds received upon enforcement of any Senior_
Secured Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals; provided, however, that as long as the New
Revolving Credit Facility has not been cancelled, discharged or otherwise terminated, the amount of
Hedging Obligations permitted to receive such priority will be limited. Any proceeds received upon any
enforcement over any Senior Secured Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals, after all
obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid and such Hedging Obligations
and other obligations, if any, have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and any other obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Senior Secured Notes Collateral on a
_pari passu basis pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement._

**OPTIONAL REDEMPTION**

**Optional redemption of Senior Secured Notes**

Except as described below and except as described under "—Redemption for taxation reasons", the
Senior Secured Notes are not redeemable until     , 2023. On and after     , 2023, the Issuer

261


-----

may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount)
_plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable_
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
for the years indicated below:


**Year**


**Redemption**
**Price**


2023 ........................................................................................................................       %

2024 %

2025 and thereafter ................................................................................................. %

Prior to     , 2023, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the aggregate principal amount of
any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, with funds
in an aggregate amount (the "Redemption Amount") not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or
more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of      % of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 60% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
the aggregate principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) remains outstanding
after each such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 120 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

Any redemption notice given in respect of the redemption referred to in the preceding paragraph may
be given prior to completion of the related Equity Offering, and any such redemption or notice may, at
the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, including the
completion of the related Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to     , 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Senior
Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date). Any such redemption and notice may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent.

**General**

The Issuer may repurchase Senior Secured Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market
or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under "—Selection and notice" below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any
such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may
be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been
satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case shall
the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such
redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be
performed by another Person.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Senior Secured Notes, it will, for so long as the Senior
Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for trading on the Global

262


-----

Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the applicable redemption date inform Euronext Dublin of such optional redemption and confirm the
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after
such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior
Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will
be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

**SINKING FUND**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**REDEMPTION AT MATURITY**

On     , 2026, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount _plus accrued and unpaid_
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**SELECTION AND NOTICE**

If less than all the Senior Secured Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar or the Paying
Agent will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the
principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Secured Notes are listed, and in compliance
with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Senior Secured Notes are not so listed or
such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Secured Notes are not held through
Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of selection based on a
method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Registrar or the Paying Agent (as
applicable) deems fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Senior Secured Note of €100,000
in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples
of €1,000, will be redeemed. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for
trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, any such notice to
the Holders of the relevant Senior Secured Notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted by
such rules, be posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin) concurrently with the notice delivered via mail or through
Euroclear and Clearstream or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter and in addition to such
release, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer shall mail such
notice to Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may also be posted on the website
of Euronext Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of Euronext Dublin. For Senior Secured Notes which are represented by Global
Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant
notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the
aforesaid mailing.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case
of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of
the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global
Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date
fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured
Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

263


-----

**REDEMPTION FOR TAXATION REASONS**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (which notice
will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax
_Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due and
which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) which change or amendment
is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, on or after
such later date); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application, administration
or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which
change or amendment is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date
(or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the
Issue Date, on or after such later date) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change
_in Tax Law"),_

the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect
of the Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this
would be reasonable). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with
the procedures described under "—Selection and notice".

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Issuer or Senior Secured Notes Guarantor would be obliged to pay
Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
such Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and that it
or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent
tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to
the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Law. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will accept such Officer's Certificate and opinion
as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above and compliance
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply (a) to any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor only if the payment giving rise to
such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Senior Secured Notes Guarantor without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person and to any
jurisdiction in which any successor Person is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered to be
a tax resident or maintaining a permanent establishment or doing business for Tax purposes or any
jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such successor Person and any political subdivision or
taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**WITHHOLDING TAXES**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor thereto (each,
a "Payor") on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any Taxes imposed or levied by:

264


-----

(1) any jurisdiction in which a Payor is then incorporated, organized, or otherwise considered to be
a tax resident or maintaining a permanent establishment or doing business for tax purposes, or
any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax;
or

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on any such Senior Secured Note or Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such Payor (including, without limitation,
the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent for the Senior Secured Notes), or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of clauses (1) and
(2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),

will at any time be required in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor under or with
respect to any Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, including, without limitation,
payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, premium, if any, or interest, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as may be
necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holder after such
withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such deduction, withholding or imposition in respect
of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such
payments in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition; provided, however, that no such
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any actual or deemed present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the
beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner,
member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial owner,
if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability
company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or
resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment, place of business or place of management in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction)
but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition or ownership of
a Senior Secured Note or the receipt of any payment in respect of, or the enforcement of, the
Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of
any Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable
the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to comply with
any certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements, which are
required by applicable law, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes imposed by the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to provide such certification, information or documentation;

(c) any Taxes that are required to be paid other than by deduction or withholding from a payment
on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(e) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Senior Secured Note presented for payment (where
presentation is permitted or required for payment) to a Holder or beneficial owner who would
have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Secured Note to another
Paying Agent;

(f) any Taxes imposed pursuant to or in connection with Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
(or any amended or successor version of such sections), the Treasury regulations thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof or any similar law or regulations adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with
respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code; or

(g) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for
payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant

265


-----

payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day
of such 30-day period).

In addition, such Additional Amounts shall not be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who
is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured
Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner of such Senior Secured Notes would not have been entitled to such
Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured
Notes directly.

The Payor or the applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and
(ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance
with applicable law. The Payor will (i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment by the Payor of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction or, if notwithstanding such Payor's efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not obtained, then such other evidence of payment of such Taxes by the Payor as is
reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and (ii) provide such certified copies or
such evidence of payment to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date
the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made. Copies of such documentation will be
available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
by the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Listing Agent if the Senior
Secured Notes are then listed on Euronext Dublin.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to
any payment made on any Senior Secured Note or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days
prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer's
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such
other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders or the
beneficial owner on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises,
or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date,
in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date
that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be entitled to rely
solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever there are mentioned, in any context in any of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees or this Description of the Senior Secured Notes: (1) the payment of
principal, (2) purchase price in connection with a purchase of Senior Secured Notes, (3) interest, or (4)
any other amount payable on or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, such reference shall be
deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that,
in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise, property or similar Taxes (including any reasonable expenses related thereto) that arise
in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, initial resale, or registration
or any payments under or with respect to any Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto, or in any tax jurisdiction on the enforcement of any of the foregoing (other than on a transfer of
Senior Secured Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers or any payments under or
with respect thereto, and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to any payments under or with
respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded
under clauses (a), (b) and (d) through (f) above, under the second and third paragraphs under this
heading or any combination thereof) and the Payor agrees to indemnify the Holders for any such Taxes
paid by or on behalf of such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Senior Secured Notes, and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to a Payor and to any jurisdiction in which any successor to
the Payor is incorporated or otherwise considered to be a tax resident or maintaining a permanent
establishment or doing business for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment
on the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such
successor and any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under
this heading "Change of Control", each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all
or any part (equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's
Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of each Note,
_plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the_
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Senior Secured
Notes as described under this heading, "Change of Control", in the event and to the extent that it has
unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes as described under "—
_Optional redemption" and has not defaulted in the payment of the applicable redemption price or all_
conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Secured Notes as
described under "—Optional redemption" and has not defaulted in the payment of the applicable
redemption price or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the
date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send a notice (the
"Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of any such Senior Secured Notes, by mail or otherwise in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with a copy to the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such
Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Senior
Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior
Secured Notes _plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not_
including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to
receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control Payment");

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Payment Date") and the record date;

(3) stating that any Senior Secured Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change
of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Secured Notes or part thereof not tendered
will continue to accrue interest;

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Secured Notes repurchased;
and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred,
the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate
stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior
Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof
that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

267


-----

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to
be delivered), at the Issuer's expense, to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the
Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will,
at the Issuer's expense, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to
each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount
to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such
new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and
admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, the
Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,
post such notices on the official website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin).

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with
respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain
provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right
to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a
Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering
Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive
agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control
Offer is made.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations
conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the
Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control
Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the
New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event under the New Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of
Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also
contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or
require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event.
Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the
Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be
available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
_Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to_
_finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change_
_of control triggering event as required by the Indentures, and the change of control provision contained_
_in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate_
_events"._

268


-----

In addition, the definitions of "Change of Control Triggering Event" and "Permitted Holders" expressly
permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction (i) which is a Specified Change of
Control Event or (ii) which is a Change of Control but not a Change of Control Triggering Event, in each
case without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise
established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an
offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may
be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for
the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have
been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Debt that
may be Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Secured Notes Guarantors pursuant to
this paragraph (1) shall not exceed €50.0 million at any time outstanding.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding
the greater of (x) €50 million and (y) 48.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, _provided,_ that any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such
refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with
an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including
any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing);

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
(other than pursuant to this clause (2)); _provided that, if Indebtedness being_
Guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes or a Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated or pari passu, as
applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness Guaranteed; and

(b) without limiting the "—Limitation on Liens" covenant, Indebtedness arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (other than pursuant
to this clause (2));

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

269


-----

(a) (1) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (2) any sale or other transfer of any
such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be; and

(b) if the Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness
and the obligee is not the Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, such
Indebtedness must be (a) unsecured and (b) except in respect of intercompany current
liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business, if the aggregate principal amount
of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor exceeds
€2.5 million, to the extent legally permitted expressly subordinated to the prior payment
in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the
applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors and such condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if each such obligee
accedes to the New Intercreditor Agreement as an Intra-Group Lender (as defined in
the New Intercreditor Agreement);

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior
Secured Notes) and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees thereof and Indebtedness
represented by the Senior Subordinated Notes (other than any Additional Senior Subordinated
Notes, as defined in "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes") and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantees (as defined in "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes")
thereof, (b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (3), (4)(a) and
(16) of this paragraph) entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date, (c) Refinancing
Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in sub- clauses (a), (b) and (c)
of this clause (4) or clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of
this covenant and (d) Management Advances;

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred to finance an
acquisition or (y) Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
or merged, consolidated, amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; provided,
_however, that after giving effect to such acquisition or merger, consolidation or amalgamation_
either: (a) the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness
pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of this
covenant; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or merger, consolidation or amalgamation;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for _bona fide_ hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the
Board of Directors of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase
Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of
the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement of property, plant or equipment used
in a Similar Business or (B) Indebtedness otherwise Incurred to finance the purchase, lease,
rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal)
or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase
of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which
refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness (provided that, in each case, the
Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental, construction, design,
installation or improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter), in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any
time outstanding the greater of (x) €15 million and (y) 14.4% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers' compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other

and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value), actually received by the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

that such Issuer Proceeds Loan has been Incurred in compliance with this covenant other than
this clause (12); provided, further, that such Guarantees are subordinated to the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, as applicable, pursuant to the New

(15) Indebtedness (including any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together
with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (15) and
then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of (x) €40 million and (y) 38.4% of Consolidated
EBITDA; and

(16) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of leases (including

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided_ that (a) all Indebtedness
outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially Incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b)
of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant, and may not be reclassified and
(b) all Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph
of this covenant that is secured by Liens on Senior Secured Notes Collateral that is accorded
super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Senior Secured Notes
Collateral under the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
pursuant to clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph may not be reclassified;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (7), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greatest of (x) the maximum
mandatory redemption, (y) repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) and (z) the liquidation preference thereof;

(5) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of
determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option

272


-----

of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are
entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for
purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x)
if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio
(including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to
such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of
such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition
and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not
be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the
time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date
the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating
any baskets or ratios under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition; and

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under
this "—Limitation on Indebtedness". The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will
be: (i) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS and (ii) the principal amount of the Indebtedness,
in the case of any other Indebtedness. For the purposes of determining any particular amount of
Indebtedness under this "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, obligations with respect to letters of
credit, Guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the
determination of such particular amount will not be included.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date
(and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under this "—Limitation on Indebtedness", the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would
cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with
respect to euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the

273


-----

Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

"Investment") not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the Issuer

Specified Change of Control Event; further provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) any amounts (such amounts, the "Excluded Amounts") that would otherwise be

receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or marketable securities received from the Initial
Investors in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, (2) the purpose of the receipt of such
Net Cash Proceeds or marketable securities was to reduce the Consolidated Net
Leverage Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control
Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in
connection with such Change of Control Triggering Event in accordance with the

Issuer acting in good faith; provided that any determination of the fair market value of such property or
assets in excess of €10 million shall be made solely by the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, "Permitted Payments"):

Issuer; provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market
value of property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of
the first paragraph describing this covenant or to be net cash proceeds from an Equity Offering

fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face amount, and the fair market value of
any non-cash Restricted Payment shall be determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of

Directors of the Issuer acting in good faith, provided that any determination of the fair market value of a
non-cash Restricted Payment in excess of €10 million shall be made solely by the Board of Directors of

**Limitation on Liens**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur

or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is
securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the "Initial Lien"), except (a) in the case of any property or asset
that does not constitute Senior Secured Notes Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property
or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, or in the case of Liens securing Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses
(1), (6) or (7) of the second paragraph of the "Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, pari passu with
(except that such Indebtedness may receive priority in respect of distributions of proceeds of any
enforcement of Collateral) the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Senior Secured
Notes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Secured Notes will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates, and (ii)
otherwise as set forth under "—Security—Release of Liens".

**Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock to the
Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_

(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the New Revolving
Credit Facility); or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered
into on the Issue Date, and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals,
supplements, refunding, replacements or refinancings of those agreements referred to in

(as determined in good faith by the Issuer) or (ii) are customary in comparable financings and
where, in the case of this sub-clause (ii), the Issuer determines at the time of Incurrence of such

**Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in
good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and/or assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, and for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments.

After the receipt of Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash (at the option
of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1)
of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant or any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof within 365 days from the later of (A) the
date of such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided,
_however, that in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of_
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (a) (except in the case of any revolving
Indebtedness, including but not limited, to the New Revolving Credit Facility), the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary will be required to retire such Indebtedness or cause the
related commitment to be permanently reduced; (ii) unless included in (a)(i), to prepay,
repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu Indebtedness that is secured in whole or in part
by a Lien on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral which Lien ranks pari passu with the
Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees
at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness _plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,_

282


-----

repayment, purchase or redemption so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
makes an offer on a _pro rata_ basis to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes at a
purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes,
_plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not_
including) the date of purchase; (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Senior Secured
Notes Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute
Senior Secured Notes Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (iv) to purchase the Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to an offer to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
at least 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date);

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase
or commit to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an
investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash
received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) within 365 days from
the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; _provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets_
made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or pursuant to a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within
such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated
within 180 days of such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or
a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or
approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is
consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the
difference will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds". On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the
case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clauses (b) or
(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant), after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€20 million, the Issuer will be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset
_Disposition Offer") to all Holders of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to all_
holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer
applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price
of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes and 100% of the principal
amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not
including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in the case of
the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior
to the expiration of the 365-day period mentioned above.

283


-----

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes,
subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other
Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of
tendered Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, or by such other method as (i) the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or similar representative of such Pari Passu
Indebtedness, after consultation with the Issuer, deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as
complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange requirements). For the purposes of calculating
the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be
calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date
selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The
Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall not have any liability in connection with any method elected under
this paragraph.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed
the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is
actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such
currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer
_Period"). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period_
(the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by it
pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior
Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer,
or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn,
all Senior Secured Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an
Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for
payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agent,
as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of
the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Senior Secured Notes
an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue
a new Senior Secured Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or
cause to be transferred by book entry) such new Senior Secured Note to such Holder, in a principal
amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Note surrendered; provided that each
such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000
and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be
promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or other liabilities (other than
contingent liabilities) recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary or other liabilities (other

284

than contingent liabilities) recorded on the balance sheet of such Restricted Subsidiary and the
release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer are released from any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of payment of such
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are
not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, as determined in good faith
by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not
to exceed the greater of (x) €10 million and (y) 9.6% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being "Affiliate Transactions") involving aggregate value in
excess of €5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm's length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €10 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution
of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the "—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments" covenant, any Permitted Payments or any Permitted Investment (other than_
Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity related interests or other securities,

reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would

(12) the undertaking of a Permitted Reorganization;

(13) activities specifically permitted in connection with a Permitted Investment, other than the

_and consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Guarantors" covenant and the Senior Secured_

Person and/or Indebtedness and other obligations) for the purpose of transferring such
properties and assets to any Parent Entity, any Subsidiary or any other Person, so long as in
any case such further transfer is made promptly by the Issuer.

**Reports**

For so long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the year ending
July 31, 2021, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a)
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal
years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer
for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements
and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma

288


-----

income statement information and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) description of the business, management and
shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material
contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material
risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the quarter ending April 30, 2021, all quarterly reports of the Issuer containing
the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end
of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most
recent year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the
comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro
_forma income statement information and balance sheet information, together with explanatory_
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the relevant fiscal quarter (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably
available); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including
a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course
of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material
recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or
similar transaction, or any change in the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer, or any
other material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of
such event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above may in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied
to such periods. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Except as provided for above, no report need include
separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect
to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the
Offering Memorandum. In addition, no financial information required pursuant to clause (1) above need
be audited if not presented on an audited basis by the Issuer in its financial statements included in the
Offering Memorandum.

At any time that any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by the
first two clauses of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on
the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Group separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) standalone audited or unaudited financial statements, as
the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise)
together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets,
total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly
reports of any Parent Entity or any new holding company created following a Permitted Reorganization.

289


-----

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee of the reports
specified in (1), (2) and (3) above, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as
determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it
cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders
and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes. In the event that (i) the
Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or
elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section
13 (a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee reports
which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of IFRS
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as
it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC
pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding five paragraphs.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin for trading on
the Global Exchange Market, and the rules of that exchange so require, copies of the Issuer's
organizational documents and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the most recent consolidated
financial statements published by the Issuer may be inspected and obtained at the office of the Paying
Agent in Ireland. See "—Listing and general information".

In addition, so long as the Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which
the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to
Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers
of the Senior Secured Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under
the Securities Act.

In the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity are listed
on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (or one of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the
UK) and the Issuer or such Parent Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris
(or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more
of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the UK), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer
or such Parent Entity is, or would be, required to file with Euronext Paris pursuant to such Admission
and Disclosure Standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets in the EU or the UK, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
provided, that such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the regulated market of Euronext Paris, or one
or more of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the UK, as applicable, and provided that the
Issuer or such Parent Entity additionally provides the reports set forth in paragraph (2) above with
respect to its first and third fiscal quarters, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**Merger and consolidation**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") (if not the Issuer) will
be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the Pre-Expansion
European Union, Switzerland, Canada or the United States of America, any State of the United
States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, all the obligations
of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (b)

290


-----

all obligations of the Issuer under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
"—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and that all
conditions precedent in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to such consolidation,
merger or transfer have been satisfied and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal,
valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company and that all
conditions precedent in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to such consolidation,
merger or transfer have been satisfied (in each case, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee); _provided_ that in giving an Opinion of
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result
of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant._

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of the Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, notwithstanding clause (4)
of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
any other Restricted Subsidiary that is a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and (c) any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with,
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary that is
not a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3) (which does not apply
to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with
or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of
the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
"—Merger and consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

291


-----

_The Senior Secured Notes Guarantors_

None of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (other than a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor whose
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor is the surviving corporation),

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as
an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or becomes a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor is the continuing
Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes
all of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under its Senior
Secured Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (pursuant
to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee) and all obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents to which it is a
party; and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way
of consolidation or merger) of a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the sale
or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary)
otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the proceeds
therefrom are applied as required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the Issuer and
(b) any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the
Issuer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this "—Merger and consolidation" covenant
will not apply to any transaction or arrangement that is a Permitted Reorganization.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

**Suspension of covenants on achievement of investment grade status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then,
the Issuer shall notify the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in writing of these events and beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have
Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes: "—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments", "—Limitation on Indebtedness", "—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from_
_Restricted Subsidiaries", "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions", "—Limitation on sales of assets and_
_subsidiary stock", "—Impairment of Security Interest" and the provisions of clause (3) of the first_
paragraph of the "—Merger and consolidation" covenant and, in each case, any related default provision
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess
Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

292


-----

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during
the continuance of the Suspension Event, and (i) the "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant
will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture other
than during the period beginning with the Suspension Event and ending on the Reversion Date, (ii) any
transactions prohibited by the "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" covenant entered into after such
reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension Event
shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions" covenant, (iii) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of the Issuer or any_
Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the first paragraph of
the "—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries" covenant that becomes
effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (1) or (12)
of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted
_Subsidiaries" covenant and (iv) all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension_
Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph
of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant or one of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph
of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred thereunder as of
the Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred prior to the Suspension Event
and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so permitted
to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, such
Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as
permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant.
The Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall not be obliged to notify holders of a Suspension Event or
Reversion Date.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Issuer and any other Senior Secured Notes Guarantor shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially
impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (it being understood
that the Incurrence of Liens on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral permitted by the definition of
"Permitted Collateral Liens" and the implementation of any Permitted Reorganization shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes Collateral); and the Issuer and any other Senior Secured Notes Guarantor shall not, and the
Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent,
for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Holders and/or the other beneficiaries
described in the Security Documents and the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien in any of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral; provided that (a) the
Issuer and the Issuer's Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens or implement any
Permitted Reorganization and (b) the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may be discharged, amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or released in accordance with the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents and the New Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that, subject to the foregoing proviso, the
Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated or otherwise modified or replaced
to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral
Liens or implement any Permitted Reorganization; (iii) amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement,
release or otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents, for the purposes of undertaking a
Permitted Reorganization; (iv) provide for the release of any Security Interest on any properties and
assets constituting Senior Secured Notes Collateral from the Lien of the Security Documents; provided
that such release is followed by the substantially concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent
priority over the same properties and assets securing the Senior Secured Notes or any Senior Secured
Notes Guarantee; (v) add to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral; (vi) comply with the terms of the New
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) evidence the succession of
another Person to the Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor and the assumption by such
successor of the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes, the
applicable Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance
with the "—Merger and consolidation" covenant; or (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the
appointment of a successor trustee or Security Agent; provided that, contemporaneously with any such
action in clauses (ii) and (iii), the Issuer delivers to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, (1) a solvency
opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee from an

293


-----

Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest,
after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
modification, replacement or release, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person
which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification, replacement
or release, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification, replacement or release, the Lien or Liens
created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, modified, replaced
or released are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period,
in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification, replacement or release. In the event that
the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the
Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with
the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Indebtedness that is permitted to share
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral pursuant to the definition of "Permitted Collateral Lien", the Issuer,
the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security
Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives)
an intercreditor agreement, or a restatement, amendment or other modification of an existing
intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement"), on substantially the same terms as
the New Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including with
respect to the subordination, payment blockage, limitation on enforcement and release of Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees, priority and release of any Security Interest in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral; provided, further, that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose
any personal obligations on the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect
the personal rights, duties, liabilities, powers, protections or immunities of the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the foregoing and the succeeding paragraph, any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement may provide for pari passu security interests in respect of any
such Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted to share the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral pursuant to the definition of "Permitted Collateral Liens").

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
and the Security Agent will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the New Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein; (ii) add Senior Secured Notes Guarantors or other parties (such as
representatives of new issuances of Indebtedness) thereto; (iii) further secure the Senior Secured Notes
(including Additional Senior Secured Notes); (iv) make provision for equal and ratable grants of Liens
on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes or to implement any
Permitted Collateral Liens; (v) to enable any Permitted Reorganization; (vi) subject to the preceding
paragraph, to provide for additional Indebtedness (including with respect to any New Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes) to the extent permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or any other obligations that are permitted by the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to be Incurred and secured by a Lien on the Senior Secured Notes
Collateral on a senior, pari passu or junior basis with the Liens securing the Senior Secured Notes or
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees; (vii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the New Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (viii) amend the New Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; (ix) increase the amount
of the Credit Facilities covered by any such agreement, the Incurrence of which is not prohibited by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture; or (x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect
the rights of the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes in any material respect. The Issuer will not
otherwise direct the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment
to the New Intercreditor Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, without the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under "—Amendments and waivers", and the Issuer
may only direct the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment

294


-----

to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Security Agent,
adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, powers, protections or immunities under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

Each Holder of a Senior Secured Note, by accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed to
have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent from time
to time to give effect to such provisions;

(2) authorized each of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent from time to time
to become a party to any additional intercreditor arrangements described above;

(3) agreed to be bound by such provisions and the provisions of any additional intercreditor
arrangements described above; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent to act on its
behalf from time to time to enter into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of any
additional intercreditor arrangements described above, in each case, without the need for the
consent of the Holders.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the New Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (and the
Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; _provided, however, that such transaction would_
comply with the "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant.

**Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantees**

No Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor) shall Guarantee the payment
of, assume or in any manner become obligated under or with respect to any Indebtedness of the Issuer
or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes an Additional
Senior Secured Notes Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee or Indebtedness is
Incurred (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter) and, if applicable, executes and delivers to
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide an Additional
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee (which Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee shall be senior to
or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness).

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs in this covenant,

(1) an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor's Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
shall not be required to the extent it could result in (A) any breach or violation of statutory
limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization
rules, transfer pricing rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the
laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (B) any risk or
liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a
partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
(C) any material cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but
excluding any obligation under the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee itself) that cannot be
avoided by commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer other than reasonable
out of pocket expenses; or (D) any inconsistency with the Agreed Security Principles (but, in
the case of (A), each of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to overcome the relevant legal limitation and will procure that the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally
available to eliminate the relevant limit); and

(2) for so long as it is not permissible under applicable law or regulation for a Restricted Subsidiary
to become an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary need not
become an Additional Senior Secured Notes Guarantor (but, in such a case, each of the Issuer
and the Restricted Subsidiaries will use their commercially reasonable efforts to overcome the

295


-----

relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Guarantee and will procure that the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally
available to eliminate the relevant legal prohibition, and shall give such Guarantee at such time
(and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible).

The first paragraph of this covenant shall not apply to: (1) the granting by such Restricted Subsidiary of
a Permitted Lien under circumstances which do not otherwise constitute the Guarantee of Indebtedness
of the Issuer; (2) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness that refinances
Indebtedness which benefited from a Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in compliance
with this covenant immediately prior to such refinancing; (3) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary
that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the Guarantee was not Incurred
in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and the terms
of such Guarantee prohibit the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from becoming an Additional Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor; (4) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness Incurred under
the New Revolving Credit Facility which are in effect on the Issue Date; (5) Guarantees given by any
Restricted Subsidiary to a bank or trust company incorporated in any member state of the European
Union as of the date of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any commercial banking institution that
is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof), in each
case having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than €500 million, whose
debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof by S&P
and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash
management programs established for the Issuer's benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary and (6)
the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, including in respect of Additional Senior Subordinated
Notes, which are in effect on the Issue Date.

Each such Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws,
regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Each Senior Secured Notes Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement described under "—Senior Secured
_Notes Guarantees" and "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New_
_Intercreditor Agreement"._

**LIMITATION ON ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 3AB** **OPTIQUE DÉVELOPPEMENT PROCEEDS LOAN**
(1) The Issuer shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer or forgive or waive any principal amount
of the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan (other than to secure the Senior Secured
Notes, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or to grant
Permitted Collateral Liens);

(2) Neither the Issuer nor 3AB Optique Développement shall (i) amend the 3AB Optique
Développement Proceeds Loan in a manner adverse in any material respect to the Holders (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer), other than any amendment to the interest terms
including the interest rates payable thereunder or (ii) shorten the maturity of the 3AB Optique
Développement Proceeds Loan to a date prior to the Stated Maturity of the Senior Secured
Notes unless the maturity of the corresponding Senior Secured Notes is also similarly
shortened; provided that any amendment to the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan
shall be permitted from time to time to align the redemption provisions, maturity, covenants or
any other terms thereof to the corresponding terms of the Senior Secured Notes initially issued
on the Issue Date (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time);
and

(3) The Issuer shall not receive or accept any repayment or prepayment of principal in respect of
the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan prior to its maturity or convert the 3AB Optique
Développement Proceeds Loan into equity of 3AB Optique Développement or otherwise reduce
the outstanding principal amount thereof except to pay interest, premium or Additional Amounts
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes or to facilitate or
accommodate or reflect a repayment, redemption or repurchase of outstanding Senior Secured
Notes or Senior Subordinated Notes; provided that the amount of any such repayment,
prepayment, conversion or reduction of principal amount of the 3AB Optique Développement

296


-----

Proceeds Loan shall be no greater than the interest, premium, Additional Amounts or principal
amount of any corresponding Senior Secured Notes or Senior Subordinated Notes being paid,
repaid, redeemed or prepaid.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan may be
canceled, forgiven or otherwise repaid, released or discharged upon:

(a) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the
Capital Stock of 3AB Optique Développement (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and 3AB Optique Développement ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of the sale
or other disposition;

(b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of 3AB Optique
Développement (other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or
other disposition does not violate the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(c) [Reserved];

(d) defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes, as provided in “—
_Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;_

(e) in accordance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and consolidation”; and

(h) to the extent such cancellation, forgiveness, repayment, release or discharge,
whether by capitalization or otherwise, is necessary to pay any applicable Taxes or to comply
with applicable tax regulations regarding the deductibility of interest expense (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer).

The Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions reasonably
requested by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the New Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any repayment or release of the
3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent (except to the extent required under
clause (f) above) of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee or the Security Agent.

**PAYMENTS FOR CONSENT**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Secured Notes for or as
an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless such consideration is offered to be paid
and is paid to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in the
time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer
or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of
the terms or provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes, to exclude
holders of Senior Secured Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the solicitation of such consent, waiver or
amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for cash, or (b) the payment of the
consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration
statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable securities laws (including, but not
limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of the European Union or its member
states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) (x) would be materially

297


-----

burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially burdensome to file the consent
document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar documents or any summary thereof
with the securities or financial services authorities in such jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would
otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured
Note issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its stated maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
to comply for 30 days after notice by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with any of
its obligations under "—Change of Control" above or under the covenants described under "—
_Certain covenants" above (in each case, other than a failure to purchase Senior Secured Notes_
which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above);

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount
of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and Security Documents;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Senior Secured Notes Guarantee now exists, or is
created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
("payment default"); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross
_acceleration provision"),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €20
million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
"bankruptcy provisions");

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €20 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final (the "judgment default provision");

(8) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the New
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) with respect to Senior Secured Notes Collateral having a fair market value in excess
of €30 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in accordance with the

298


-----

terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents or any such Security Interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or any grantor of a Lien over the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral shall assert in writing that any such Security Interest is invalid or
unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the "security default provisions");
and

(9) any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Senior Secured Notes Guarantors that, taken together (as of the latest
audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or is declared invalid
or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor denies or
disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Senior Secured Notes Guarantee and any such
Default continues for 10 days (the "guarantee provisions").

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture notify the
Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure such
default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, may, and the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and
unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the
Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under "—Events of Default"
has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be
automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days
after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of
the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest
on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the New Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except
with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any, which may
only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Senior Secured Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior
Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to

299


-----

the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee has received, indemnity
and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in its
sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal, interest or premium, if any, when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Senior Secured Notes Trustee notice that an Event of
Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
have requested the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, and the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding)
reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the
receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
have not given the Senior Secured Notes Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Secured Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to
use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or that the Senior Secured Notes Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to
the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee will be entitled to receive indemnification and/or security satisfactory (including by way of prefunding) to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not
taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is
continuing and a responsible officer of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee is informed in writing of such
occurrence by the Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment
of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee in
good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to
deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an
Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the
previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, within 30 days
after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes provide for the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to take action on behalf of the
Holders in certain circumstances, but only if Holders have offered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee,
and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion. It may not be possible for the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior Secured Notes and, accordingly, in such
circumstances the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the
provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Secured Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented
or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any
default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a

300


-----

majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior
Secured Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% (or in the case of
clause (8) below, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of Senior Secured Notes affected,
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
Senior Secured Notes), an amendment or waiver may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes
held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the
time at which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above
under "—Optional Redemption" or "—Redemption for taxation reasons";

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured
Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or
to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's
Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under "—
_Withholding taxes" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes_
in any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would
result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Payor
agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Security Interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security
Documents, the New Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a
rescission of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default
that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor from any of its obligations (or modify such
obligations in any manner adverse to the Holders) under any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee
or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as applicable, except in accordance with the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior Secured Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor under any Senior Secured Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the
Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or the Holders or does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Senior Secured

301


-----

Notes Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Senior Secured Notes
Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance
of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee in
accordance with the "Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, to add Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security to or for
the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or Lien (including the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof
with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge
or retaking or amendment is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security
Documents, the New Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this
Description of the Senior Secured Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of
the Senior Secured Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, a Senior Secured Notes Guarantee, the Security Documents or the
Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a
successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the
accession by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior Secured Notes
Document; or

(9) as provided in "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" and "—Impairment of Security Interest".

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall be entitled to require
and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel, which shall be conclusive.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of
the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's
Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin
and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will inform Euronext Dublin of any of the foregoing
amendments, supplements and waivers and publish a notice of any of the foregoing amendments,
supplements and waivers on the website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
of Euronext Dublin.

**ACTS BY HOLDERS**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Issuer or by any
Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with,
the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its and each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor's obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture ("legal defeasance") and cure
all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting
the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith
and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior Secured
Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer

302


-----

exercises its legal defeasance option, the Security Documents will terminate (other than with respect to
the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and each Restricted Subsidiary's obligations under the
covenants described under "—Certain covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) of "—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation") and "—Change of Control" and the default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under "—Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross default upon
a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the
Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the
security default provision described under "—Events of Default" above ("covenant defeasance").

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to
such Senior Secured Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the "—Merger
_and consolidation—The Issuer" covenant), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) under "—Events of Default"_
above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
"defeasance trust") with the Senior Secured Notes Trustee cash in euro or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Senior Secured Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply
with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders and beneficial owners of
the Senior Secured Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income
tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance
only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the
Holders under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights
of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when (1) either (a) all the
Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain lost, stolen or
destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for payment
was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered
to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously
delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii)

the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Senior

303


-----

Secured Notes Trustee, cash in euro or euro-denominated European Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness
on the Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior
Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as
the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable (i) under the

Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents; and (4)
the Issuer has delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and discharge" section
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's
Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under the Senior Secured Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note
waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance
of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION**

Application will be made to list the Senior Secured Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to
admit the Senior Secured Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market. The Issuer may also choose
to list on another recognized stock exchange. There can be no assurance that the application to list the
Senior Secured Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and to admit the Senior
Secured Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market will be approved, and settlement of the Senior
Secured Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. If and so long as the Senior Secured Notes
are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market,
the Issuer will maintain a listing, paying and transfer agent in Ireland with respect to the Senior Secured
Notes. See "—Certain covenants—Maintenance of Listing".

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin and
the rules of Euronext Dublin shall so require, copies, current and future, of all of the Issuer's annual
audited consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements, the Issuer's unaudited consolidated
interim quarterly financial statements and this Offering Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge,
during normal business hours at the registered office of the Issuer.

**CONCERNING THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES TRUSTEE AND CERTAIN AGENTS**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Senior Secured Notes Trustee under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the
continuance of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee
has been informed in writing, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee will perform only such duties as are set
forth specifically in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of
which a responsible officer of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee has been informed in writing, the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its
own affairs. The permissive rights of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee to take or refrain from taking
any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or
duty. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Secured
Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of the Holders, subject
to certain exceptions.

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee with thirty (30) days of
becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, should it become a
creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property

304


-----

received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee will
be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

Any removal or resignation of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee shall not become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain
provisions for the indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) of the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee by the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors for any loss, liability, taxes or
expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or
in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**NOTICES**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register
of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the Senior Secured
Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such Stock Exchange shall so require, notices with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be published in a newspaper having general circulation in
Ireland (which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such
rules, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin).
In addition, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to
Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the
holders of Book-Entry Interests. Such notices may also be published on the website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
of Euronext Dublin. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such other
manner, and shall be deemed to have given, on such date, as the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may
approve.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder
if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any
defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**PRESCRIPTION**

Claims against the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date
for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor for the payment
of interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for
payment of interest.

**CURRENCY INDEMNITY AND CALCULATION OF EURO-DENOMINATED RESTRICTIONS**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered
in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a
court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Senior Secured Notes
Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, in respect of any sum
expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will only constitute a
discharge to the Issuer or such Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the
euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that
other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase
on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors will
indemnify the recipient or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost
of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima
facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Senior

305


-----

Secured Notes Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply
irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due
under any Note, any Senior Secured Notes Guarantee or to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a non- euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are located
outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any Senior
Secured Notes Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium,
interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, may not be collectable within the
United States.

**CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Issuer and
each Senior Secured Notes Guarantor will, in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, appoint an agent
for service of process and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**GOVERNING LAW**

Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

The New Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

**Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Description of the Senior Subordinated_
_Notes under the heading "Certain definitions". For purposes of this Description of the Senior_
_Subordinated Notes, (i) references to the "Issuer" refer only to Afflelou and not to any of its subsidiaries_
_and (ii) references to "we", "our", "us" or "Group" refer to the Issuer and the Issuer's Restricted_
_Subsidiaries._

Afflelou (the "Issuer") will issue €75.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated floating
rate notes due 2027 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes") under an indenture to be dated    , 2021 (the
"Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture"), among, inter alios, itself, certain subsidiaries of the Issuer that
Guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes ("Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors"), U.S. Bank
Trustees Limited, as trustee (the "Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee") and as security agent (the
"Security Agent"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. See "Notice to investors".

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which
€75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes will be issued in this offering.
We may issue an unlimited aggregate principal amount of additional Senior Subordinated Notes subject
to the provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, including the covenant restricting the
Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under "Certain covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness") and the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "Certain covenants—Limitation_
_on Liens") and the provisions described below under "Additional Senior Subordinated Notes". Unless_
the context otherwise requires, in this Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes, references to the
"Senior Subordinated Notes" include the Senior Subordinated Notes and any Additional Senior
Subordinated Notes that are actually issued. The terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes include those
set forth in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will not
be qualified under, or incorporate or include any of the provisions of, or be subject to, the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

This Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes is intended to be an overview of the material
provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. Since the
following description is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture,
the form of Senior Subordinated Notes and the New Intercreditor Agreement for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors and your rights because
they, and not this summary, define your rights as Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Copies of
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, form of Senior Subordinated Notes and the New Intercreditor
Agreement are available as set forth under "Listing and General Information".

The registered Holder of a Senior Subordinated Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.
Only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture.

**GENERAL**

**The Senior Subordinated Notes**

The Senior Subordinated Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be general senior subordinated obligations of the Issuer;

  - be guaranteed on a subordinated basis by the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors, subject
to the limitations described in "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the
_Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests";_

  - be secured on second-priority basis as set forth below under "—Security";

  - be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior indebtedness
of the Issuer, including the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the New
Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any;

  - rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer_
(other than Senior Indebtedness) that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
Senior Subordinated Notes;

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Subsidiaries of the
Issuer that are not Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors and existing and future of

339


-----

indebtedness of Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors in excess of the principal amount of
Senior Subordinated Notes guaranteed by such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors,
including obligations owed to trade creditors and bilateral facilities and, to the extent drawings
are borrowed by such non-Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor subsidiaries, obligations
under the New Revolving Credit Facility; and

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Subordinated Notes or that secure the
Senior Subordinated Notes on a junior ranking basis, to the extent of the value of such property
and assets, including the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, which also secures the Senior
Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, if any, on a
first-ranking basis.

**The Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees**

The Senior Subordinated Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the "Senior
_Subordinated Notes Guarantees") (i) on the Issue Date by 3AB Optique Développement and Alain_
Afflelou Franchiseur (the "Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors") and (ii) within 60 days
of the Issue Date, by Alain Afflelou International, 3ABOE, LSFA and L'Opticien Afflelou (the "Post-Issue
_Date Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors" and, together with the Issue Date Guarantors, the "Senior_
_Subordinated Notes Guarantors")._

Each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of the Senior Subordinated Notes will, upon issuance:

  - be a general senior subordinated obligation of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor that
granted such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee;

  - be secured by second-priority liens on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral of that Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor as described below under "—Security";

  - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future indebtedness of that Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor (other than Senior Indebtedness) that is not subordinated in
right of payment to its Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee;

  - be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future Senior
Indebtedness of the Issuer, including that Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor's obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging
Obligations, if any;

  - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor that is secured by property or assets of that Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor, to the extent of the value of such property and assets that do not secure its Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantee or that secure the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee on a
junior ranking basis, including the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, which also secures
the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations,
if any, on a first-ranking basis and the equipment and other assets securing that Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor's lease obligations; and

  - be structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of Subsidiaries of that
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor (other than Subsidiaries that are or that become Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors), including obligations owed to trade creditors, bilateral
facilities and, to the extent drawings are borrowed by such non-Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor's subsidiaries, obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility.

The obligations of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors will be contractually limited under the
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Senior Subordinated Notes—Pursuant to the subordination provisions in the New_
_Intercreditor Agreement, there is doubt as to the ability of holders of Senior Subordinated Notes to_
_recover in relation to an enforcement action premised on the Senior Subordinated Guarantees" and_
"Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit,
_financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests may adversely_
_affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral"_
and "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Guarantees and the Security Interests". In particular, the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of the_
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors incorporated in France will be limited to the outstanding

340


-----

amounts under the proceeds loans extended, directly or indirectly, to the relevant Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor using the proceeds of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Only 3AB Optique
Développement, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur and L'Opticien Afflelou will receive proceeds of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, and these proceeds loans will represent only a portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes. In addition, any claim under a Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor's guarantee of the Senior Secured Notes will reduce that Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor's Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee by the same amount. In certain cases, these
limitations may apply to the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, but not the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantors' obligations under other debt, including the New Revolving Credit Facility. For the
twelve months ended January 31, 2021, the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors
generated 75.5% of our revenue, 89.5% of our Adjusted EBITDA and as of January 31, 2021,
constituted 89.4% of our total assets (in each case gross of intercompany balances and consolidation
eliminations).

Pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, after an acceleration event in respect of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility or other debt subject to the New Intercreditor
Agreement, neither the Issuer nor the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors may make payments in
respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees except in
connection with the realization or enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral or a
transaction in lieu of such enforcement or all amounts turned over to the Security Agent as described
under "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor
_Agreement", in which case such payments will be applied in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the_
New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and certain other future
indebtedness until such obligations are repaid in full prior to the repayment of the Senior Subordinated
Notes. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor
_Agreement"._

**Principal and maturity**

The Issuer will issue €75.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes on the
Issue Date. The Senior Subordinated Notes will mature on     , 2027. The Senior Subordinated
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

**Interest**

_Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes_

Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the "Applicable Rate"), reset
quarterly, equal to three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus      basis points, as determined
by the calculation agent (the "Calculation Agent"), which shall initially be Elavon Financial Services
DAC. Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes will:

accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

be payable in cash quarterly in arrears on each     ,     ,       and     , commencing
on     , 2021;

be payable to the Holder of record of such Senior Subordinated Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date (except for Definitive Registered
Notes, if any are issued under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, which will have a
record date of 15 days prior to any interest payment date as further described under "—Transfer
_and Exchange"); and_

be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in the Interest
Period.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes.

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Interest Calculation Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount
of interest payable on the Senior Subordinated Notes in respect of the following Interest Period
(the “Interest Amount”) and notify the Issuer in writing thereof. The Interest Amount shall be
calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated

341


-----

Notes outstanding on the Interest Calculation Date, multiplying each such amount by the actual
number of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360; provided, however, that
interest shall only be paid in respect of Senior Subordinated Notes outstanding on the
applicable interest payment date. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations
will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point,
with five one millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or
.04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting
from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one half euro cent being
rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the
Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, fraud or manifest error, be final and
binding on all parties. The Trustee and any Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur
any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be
made, by the Calculation Agent.

As used herein:

“Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Issuer to calculate the interest
rate payable on the Senior Subordinated Notes in respect of each Interest Period, which shall
initially be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

“EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per
annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date that appears on Reuters page EURIBOR01
as of 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Interest Calculation Date; provided, however, that
EURIBOR shall never be less than 0%. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a
rate or is unavailable on an Interest Calculation Date, the Issuer or an agent of the Issuer will
request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the euro zone inter-bank
market, as selected by the Issuer or an agent of the Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered
quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels
time) on such Interest Calculation Date, to prime banks in the euro zone inter-bank market for
deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that
is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least two such offered
quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of
such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Issuer or an agent of
the Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Issuer or an
agent of the Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of
approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on such Interest Calculation Date, for loans in a
Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning
on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Interest Calculation Date. If at least
two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean
of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then EURIBOR in respect of such
Interest Period will be the EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest
Period.

If the Issuer determines, prior to any Interest Calculation Date, that:

(1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR;

(2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently;

(3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR;

(4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the
international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or

(5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Issuer or a third party agent
of the Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR,

a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner,
shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that
has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or
working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is
expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or
comparable to the Senior Subordinated Notes (and any applicable adjustment spread required
to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic

prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR
(the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”),

Calculation Agent and the Paying Agents, at least five Business Days prior to any Interest
Calculation Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the
Trustee, the Calculation Agent and Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and
absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever),
which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be
bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or
consent by the Holders or the Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor
Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Issuer shall
promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread).
Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to
“EURIBOR” in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such
Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread).

_Payments of Interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes_

The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Senior Subordinated Notes to receive the payments
of interest on such Senior Subordinated Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear Bank
SA/NV ("Euroclear") and Clearstream Banking S.A. ("Clearstream"). If the due date for any payment in
respect of any Senior Subordinated Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment
as a result of any such delay.

**Methods of receiving payments on the Senior Subordinated Notes**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes will be payable at the specified office or
agency of one or more Paying Agents; _provided_ that all such payments with respect to Senior
Subordinated Notes represented by one or more Global Notes registered in the name of or held by a
nominee of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on any certificated securities ("Definitive Registered Notes") will
be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the United Kingdom. In
addition, interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the Person entitled
thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "—Paying Agent and Registrar
_for the Senior Subordinated Notes"._

343


-----

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Senior Subordinated Notes**

The Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Subordinated Notes, including in the
United Kingdom. The initial Paying Agent will be Elavon Financial Services DAC.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a "Registrar") with offices in Ireland. The
initial Registrar will be Elavon Financial Services DAC. The initial transfer agent will be Elavon Financial
Services DAC. The Registrar and the transfer agent will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes, if issued, outstanding from time to time and will make payments on and
facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Issuer. Upon demand by the Issuer,
the Registrar shall (at the expense of the Issuer) send a copy of the register reflecting ownership of
Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time maintained by it to the Issuer and the Issuer
shall keep such copy of the register at its registered office.

The Issuer may change the Paying Agents, the Registrars or the transfer agents without prior notice to
the Holders. For so long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext
Dublin and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so
require, the Issuer will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent in a
newspaper having a general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notice on the official website of Euronext
Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin).

**Transfer and exchange**

The Senior Subordinated Notes will be issued in the form of one or more registered notes in global form
without interest coupons attached, as follows:

Senior Subordinated Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes"). The 144A
Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Senior Subordinated Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global
Notes, the "Global Notes"). The Regulation S Global Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited
with and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to Persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or Persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer
_restrictions". In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or_
participants in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary
procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream
and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes (the "144A Book-Entry Interests") may be transferred to
a Person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the
"Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to
a Person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning
of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with
the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable
securities law of any other jurisdiction.

344


-----

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note from which it was transferred and
will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and
after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, upon receipt by the
Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required
by the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon
directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant which owns the
relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest
will, except as set forth in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarized below and described more fully under "Transfer restrictions".

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Subordinated Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof to Persons who take
delivery thereof in the form of Definitive Registered Notes. In connection with any such transfer or
exchange, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder
to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or
exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any
Taxes payable in connection with such transfer or exchange.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any
Senior Subordinated Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Senior Subordinated
Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Subordinated
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change
of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Security Agent, the Registrar
and any transfer agent will be entitled to treat the registered Holder of a Senior Subordinated Note as
the owner of it for all purposes.

To the extent Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Issuer will make each interest payment
to the Holders of record of such Definitive Registered Notes on the date that is 15 days prior to any
such interest payment date.

**ADDITIONAL SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES**

From time to time, subject to the Issuer's compliance with the covenants described under the headings
"—Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" and "—Certain covenants—Limitation on Liens",
the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Senior Subordinated Notes ("Additional Senior Subordinated
_Notes"), which shall have the terms set out in an Officer's Certificate supplied to the Senior Subordinated_
Notes Trustee. Such Additional Senior Subordinated Notes will be treated, along with all other series of
Senior Subordinated Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series; provided that Additional Senior Subordinated Notes will not be issued
with the same CUSIP, ISIN or common code, as applicable, as existing Senior Subordinated Notes
unless such Additional Senior Subordinated Notes are fungible with the existing Senior Subordinated
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the Issuer's sole discretion, the aforementioned Officer's
Certificate may include provisions pertaining to the redemption of such Additional Senior Subordinated
Notes, in whole or in part, including, but not limited to, any special mandatory redemption in the event
that the release from any escrow into which proceeds of the issuance of such Additional Senior

345


-----

Subordinated Notes are deposited is conditioned on the consummation of any acquisition, Investment,
refinancing or other transaction (such redemption, a "Special Mandatory Redemption"). In addition,
such Officer's Certificate may include provisions pursuant to which such Additional Senior Subordinated
Notes are issued bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code pending the satisfaction of certain
conditions, such as the consummation of an acquisition, and such Additional Senior Subordinated Notes
bearing a temporary CUSIP, ISIN or common code may be automatically exchanged for new Additional
Senior Subordinated Notes bearing the same ISIN or common code as the Senior Subordinated Notes
issued on the Issue Date; provided that such Additional Senior Subordinated Notes are fungible with
the Senior Subordinated Notes issued on the relevant issue date for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and
this Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes, references to "Senior Subordinated Notes" shall be
deemed to include references to the Senior Subordinated Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as
well as any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes.

**RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES AND UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES**

On the Issue Date, all of the Issuer's direct and indirect Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries. In
the circumstances described below under "—Certain definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary", the Issuer
will be permitted to designate Restricted Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants contained in the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not Guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes.

**SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES GUARANTEES**

**General**

The Senior Subordinated Notes will be Guaranteed by each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor.
These Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors. Each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee is a full and unconditional
Guarantee of the Issuer's obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes, subject to the contractual
limitations discussed below.

The obligations of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors will be contractually limited under the
applicable Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees to reflect limitations under applicable law and the
Agreed Security Principles with respect to, among other things, maintenance of share capital, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference or conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For
a description of such contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests"._

Not all of the Issuer's Subsidiaries will Guarantee the Senior Subordinated Notes. In the event of a
bankruptcy, liquidation, winding up or reorganization of any of these non-Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor Subsidiaries, the non-Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiaries will pay the holders
of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the
Issuer.

As the Issuer has limited assets of its own other than its shares in its Subsidiaries, the Issuer is
dependent upon its Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Senior
Subordinated Notes. The operations of the Issuer are conducted primarily through its Subsidiaries and
therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of such Subsidiaries to possess adequate cash to ensure
it can meet its obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes. The Senior Subordinated Notes and
the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all
Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of
the Issuer's non-Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Issuer or any
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiary's liquidation,
winding up or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes
to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiary's creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer or such Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Issuer or such Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the
assets of the non-Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the nonSenior Subordinated Notes Guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer or such Senior

346


-----

Subordinated Notes Guarantor. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and
_the Collateral—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer's non-guarantor_
_subsidiaries"._

**Subsequent Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees**

The Issuer may from time to time designate a Restricted Subsidiary as an additional guarantor of the
Senior Subordinated Notes (an "Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor") by causing it to
execute and deliver to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form
attached to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will
become a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor.

Each Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor will, jointly and severally with the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors and each other Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor,
irrevocably Guarantee (each Guarantee, an "Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee"), as
primary obligor and not merely as surety, on a senior subordinated basis the full and punctual payment
when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all payment obligations of the
Issuer under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes, whether for
payment of principal of, or interest on or in respect of, the Senior Subordinated Notes, fees, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise. The obligations of any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
will be contractually limited under its Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee to reflect
limitations under applicable law and the Agreed Security Principles, including restrictions on the granting
of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other
legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, "thin
capitalization" rules, maintenance of share capital, retention of title claims and similar principles
applicable to such Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor and its shareholders, directors and
general partner. Any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee shall be issued on substantially
the same terms as the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees (subject to the foregoing contractual
limitations). For purposes of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and this Description of the Senior
Subordinated Notes, references to the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees include references to
any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees and references to the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantors include references to any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors.

**Releases**

Each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee (except for the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of
3AB Optique Développement) will be released:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of Capital Stock
of the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the "—
_Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below and such that the relevant_
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor no longer remains a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) in connection with any sale, disposition, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor (including by way of merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving
effect to such transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the "—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below;

(3) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture of such
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(4) upon defeasance or discharge of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as provided in "—
_Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and discharge";_

(5) in accordance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement relating to the release of a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee on
an enforcement sale or other disposal of such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor;

(6) as described under "—Amendments and waivers";

(7) with respect to an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee given under the _"—_
_Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees" covenant below, upon release of the Senior_
Subordinated Notes Guarantee that gave rise to the requirement to issue such Additional Senior

347


-----

Subordinated Notes Guarantee so long as no Event of Default would arise as a result and no
other Indebtedness that would give rise to an obligation to give an Additional Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantee is at that time Guaranteed by the relevant Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor;

(8) with respect to any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor which is not the continuing or
surviving Person in the relevant consolidation or merger, as a result of a Permitted
Reorganization or a transaction permitted by the "—Merger and consolidation—The Senior
_Subordinated Notes Guarantors" covenant below and the Senior Subordinated Notes_
Indenture; or

(9) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the Senior
Subordinated Notes.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of 3AB Optique Développement will be released upon the
occurrence of any event described in clauses (4), (5), (6), (8) or (9) above.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent (as applicable) shall, subject to receipt
of certain documents from the Issuer and/or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors, and subject to the
terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement, each take all necessary actions reasonably requested by the
Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the New Intercreditor Agreement, to
effectuate any release of a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of a Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.
Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee without
the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee. Neither
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee nor the Issuer will be required to make a notation on the Senior
Subordinated Notes to reflect any such release, termination or discharge.

**SECURITY**

**General**

The Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees will be secured by
shared second-ranking security interests (A) as of the Issue Date, over collateral consisting of (i)
pledges of certain securities accounts relating to all securities issued by or held in 3AB Optique
Développement, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, L'Opticien Afflelou, 3ABOE and Lion / Seneca France
Audio, (ii) pledges of certain bank accounts of the Issuer and the Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantors and (iii) pledges of certain intercompany receivables owed to the Issuer and the Issue Date
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors (collectively, the "Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes
_Collateral") and (B) within 60 days of the Issue Date, over collateral consisting of (i) all shares issued_
by or held in Alain Afflelou International and (ii) pledges of certain bank accounts of the Post-Issue Date
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors (collectively, the "Post-Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes
_Collateral" and, together with the Issue Date Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, the "Senior_
_Subordinated Notes Collateral"), along with obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the New_
Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations. However, pursuant to the New
Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes will receive proceeds from
enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after the
lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, counterparties to certain Hedging
Obligations, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the holders of any other Indebtedness
permitted to be incurred and secured by the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral on a senior priority
basis to the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement have been repaid in full.

The liens on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral to secure the Senior Subordinated Notes and
the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively as the "Security Interest".
Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted to secure
obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture would
also constitute "Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral".

The Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under
applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to security providers and their shareholders, directors
and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency Law

348


-----

_Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests". The grant and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles._
The Agreed Security Principles provide that certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not
perfected), including:

if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders;

if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in
that category will be subject to security;

if providing such security would require consent of any person, subject to certain obligations to take
steps to obtain such consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such
security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend to the material
detriment of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require
any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain
conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors;

if providing such security (i) would be prohibited by statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial
assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, transfer pricing rules, capital
maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or
analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (after the use of reasonable endeavors to
overcome the relevant legal limitation, if possible), (ii) would be outside the applicable pledgor's
capacity or conflict with its fiduciary duties, or (iii) could result in any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or shareholders;

if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain
categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets; and

no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
is not located but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor in relation to security granted by another Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor located in a different jurisdiction and (where otherwise consistent with the
Agreed Security Principles) in any supranational registries agreed between the Issuer and the
Security Agent from time to time.

The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes will be interpreted and
applied in good faith by the Issuer.

The Liens securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees will
also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors under the
Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility, certain Hedging Obligations, if any, and
certain other future Indebtedness; provided, however, that Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes
will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral and certain
distressed disposals only after the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any,
counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the holders
of any other Indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured by the Senior Subordinated Notes
Collateral on a senior priority basis to the Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement have been repaid in full. Furthermore, pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, the
Senior Subordinated Notes will be subject to certain payment blockage, standstill and turnover
provisions. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the "—Impairment of
_Security Interest" covenant below, each of the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors_
is permitted to pledge the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral in connection with future Incurrences
of Indebtedness, including any Additional Senior Subordinated Notes, in each case, permitted under
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and other Indebtedness of members of the Group and on
terms consistent with the relative priority in right of payment of such Indebtedness under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement.

In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by
operation of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or
discharge of the Senior Subordinated Notes as provided in "—Defeasance" or _"—Satisfaction and_
_discharge", in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Senior Subordinated Notes_
Indenture.

349


-----

There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral
would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees may
be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Senior
Subordinated Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral,
subject to the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. No appraisals of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Senior
Subordinated Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral will be illiquid
and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes_
_may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or_
_diluted under certain circumstances" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees_
_and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes". In_
addition, the New Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security Agent to
release the Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other creditors. These limitations may
include requirements that some or all of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral be disposed of only
pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See "Description of Certain Other
_Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral, the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors, as the case
may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral and to collect, invest and
dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Senior Subordinated
Notes Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and
all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting
from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether
similar or dissimilar to the foregoing).

The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations
secured by the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, if any, the trustee under the indenture governing
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior
Subordinated Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to
act as its agent and security agent under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the
counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, if any,
the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee have, and by accepting a Senior Subordinated Note, each Holder will be deemed to have,
irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the New Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each
Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be
executed by the Security Agent on its behalf.

Further, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a
Senior Subordinated Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions
of the New Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered
into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein). See "Description of Certain
_Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors will grant
security over the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral to secure the obligations of the Issuer under the
Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the obligations of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors under their respective Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees
and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into by, inter
_alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent._

The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders

350


-----

under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if
any, and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes issued pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (as defined in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes") (who will each have prior-ranking
security interests over the same Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral). The Security Agent will also act
on behalf of certain future secured creditors.

The Security Documents provide that the rights with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral
must be exercised by the Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders
are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act
through the Security Agent and only in compliance with the standstill provisions of the New Intercreditor
Agreement..

The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents
that is in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor
Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. See "—Release of Liens" and "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than_
_repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees_
_will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without_
_your consent or the consent of the Trustees". In addition, the terms of the Security Documents_
themselves provide for assets to cease to become subject to security in certain circumstances without
need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge, or the exclusion of
certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example,
assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). The Security
Agent will commence enforcement action under the Security Documents only in accordance with the
terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement. See "—Enforcement of Security Interest".

In the event that the Issuer or any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors enters into insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, gestion controlée, liquidation judiciaire, faillite déclarée or similar proceedings,
the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in
the New Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity
of the Security Interest or the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders
might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws_
_and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests may adversely affect the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral"._

**Release of Liens**

The Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors will be entitled, in addition to the
circumstances described above, to require the Security Agent to release the Security Interest in respect
of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantees under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in the case of Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral owned by the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Issuer, in connection with any sale or disposition of such property or assets
to (a) any Person that is not the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary either before or after giving
effect to such transaction, if such sale or other disposition does not violate the "—Limitation on
_sales of assets and subsidiary stock" covenant below or (b) to the Issuer or any Senior_
Subordinated Notes Guarantor; provided that such transfer is otherwise in compliance with the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and, in the case of clause (b), immediately following such
sale or disposition, a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets or property exists
or is granted in favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee for the Holders);

(2) in connection with the release of a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor from its Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor;

(3) if the Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the
release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

351


-----

(4) upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and
_discharge";_

(5) in compliance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement relating to disposals of assets subject to security (see "Description of
_Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement");_

(6) (i) in accordance with "—Amendments and waivers", (ii) in accordance with the "—Impairment
_of Security Interest" covenant below and (iii) in accordance with the second paragraph under_
the "—Limitation on Liens" covenant below so long as immediately after the release there is no
other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the property or assets that was the subject of the
Initial Lien that would result in the requirement for the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantees to be secured equally and ratably with, or prior to, such Lien;

(7) in order to effectuate a Permitted Reorganization or a merger, consolidation, conveyance or
transfer conducted in compliance with the "—Merger and consolidation" covenant below;
_provided that following such Permitted Reorganization or merger, consolidation, conveyance or_
transfer, a Lien of at least equivalent ranking over the same assets or property is granted in
favor of the Security Agent (on its own behalf and on behalf of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee for the Holders) to the extent such assets or property continue to exist as assets or
property of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(8) upon the full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture and the Senior Subordinated Notes; or

(9) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture.

The Security Agent and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee (only if required) will take all necessary
action reasonably requested by the Issuer required to effectuate any release of Senior Subordinated
Notes Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Documents. Each of the releases set forth above shall be permitted to be effected by the Security Agent
without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee.

**Enforcement of Security Interest**

The ability of the Security Agent to enforce any Security Interest is restricted by the terms of the New
Intercreditor Agreement by reference to the interests of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit
Facility and the counterparties to certain Hedging Obligations. See "Description of Certain Other
_Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement". It may also be restricted by_
similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured by the Senior Subordinated
Notes Collateral in compliance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor
Agreement.

Similar provisions may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance
with the "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" covenant below.

To establish the relative rights of certain creditors of the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantors under our financing arrangements, including, without limitation, the Senior Subordinated
Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging
Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness, the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantors, the agent under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee,
the trustee under the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes and the Security Agent will enter
into the New Intercreditor Agreement. See "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other
_Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement". Pursuant to the terms of the New Intercreditor_
Agreement, any liabilities in respect of obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes, and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other future Indebtedness
benefitting from Liens on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral that rank senior to the Liens on the
Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral that secure the Senior Subordinated Notes will receive priority
with respect to any proceeds received upon enforcement of any Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral
and certain distressed disposals. Any proceeds received upon any enforcement over any Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral and certain distressed disposals, after all obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes and the New Revolving Credit Facility have been repaid and such Hedging Obligations

352


-----

and other obligations, if any, have been discharged from such recoveries, will be applied pro rata in
repayment of all obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated
Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees and any other obligations of the Issuer and the
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors permitted to be Incurred and secured by the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis pursuant to the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement.

**Subordination**

The Senior Subordinated Notes constitute senior subordinated indebtedness, which means that,
pursuant to the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture,
the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees rank junior, and are
expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors, including any obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees.

Pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, the ability to take enforcement action against the Issuer
and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the New
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date.
In addition, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement permit the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries to Incur additional Indebtedness to which the Senior Subordinated
Notes may be subordinated under the New Intercreditor Agreement. For a description of the restrictions
imposed by the New Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness and Other
_Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement” and “Risk Factors—The rights to enforce remedies with_
_respect to the Collateral securing the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes_
_Guarantees are limited as long as any senior secured debt is outstanding”._

In addition, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will provide that the Senior Subordinated Notes
may be subordinated to additional Senior Indebtedness, even with respect to creditors that have not
entered into the New Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Senior
_Subordinated Notes—The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and New Intercreditor Agreement will_
_contain provisions that subordinate our obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes”._

Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of the
Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors would recover disproportionately more than the
holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes recover in any insolvency or similar proceeding relating to
such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the
principal of or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes.

See also “Description of Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement”
elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

**OPTIONAL REDEMPTION**

**Optional redemption of Senior Subordinated Notes**

Except as described below and except as described under "—Redemption for taxation reasons", the
Senior Subordinated Notes are not redeemable until     , 2023. On and after     , 2023, the
Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Subordinated Notes upon not less than
10 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of
principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including,
the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the twelve-month period
beginning on       for the years indicated below:


**Year**

In addition, prior to     , 2023, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the Senior
Subordinated Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right

353


-----

of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment
date). Any such redemption and notice may, at the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent.

**General**

The Issuer may repurchase Senior Subordinated Notes at any time and from time to time in the open
market or otherwise.

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under "—Selection and notice" below.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the
Senior Subordinated Notes or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date.
Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer's discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed; provided that in no case
shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which
such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the
redemption price and performance of the Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be
performed by another Person.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of the Senior Subordinated Notes, it will, for so long as the
Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for trading on
the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the applicable redemption date inform Euronext Dublin of such optional redemption
and confirm the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes that will remain
outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior
Subordinated Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest
will be payable to Holders whose Senior Subordinated Notes will be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

**SINKING FUND**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes.

**REDEMPTION AT MATURITY**

On     , 2027, the Issuer will redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount _plus accrued and unpaid_
interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**SELECTION AND NOTICE**

If less than all the Senior Subordinated Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Registrar or the Paying
Agent will select Senior Subordinated Notes for redemption in compliance with the requirements of the
principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed, and in
compliance with the requirements of Euroclear or Clearstream, or if the Senior Subordinated Notes are
not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Senior Subordinated Notes
are not held through Euroclear or Clearstream, or Euroclear or Clearstream prescribes no method of
selection based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection as the Registrar or the
Paying Agent (as applicable) deems fair and appropriate; _provided, however, that no Senior_
Subordinated Note of €100,000 in principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior
Subordinated Notes in integral multiples of €1,000, will be redeemed. Neither the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance
with this paragraph.

So long as any Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted
for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, any such notice
to the Holders of the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes shall to the extent and in the manner permitted
by such rules, be posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin

354


-----

(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin) concurrently with the notice delivered via mail or through
Euroclear and Clearstream or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter and in addition to such
release, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date, the Issuer shall mail such
notice to Holders by first class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as they appear on
the registration books of the Registrar. Such notice of redemption may also be posted on the website
of Euronext Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner
permitted by the rules of Euronext Dublin. For Senior Subordinated Notes which are represented by
Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the
relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in
substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

If any Senior Subordinated Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to
that Senior Subordinated Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.
In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal
to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the
name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of
a Global Note, an appropriate notation will be made on such Senior Subordinated Note to decrease the
principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms
of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Subordinated Notes called for redemption become due on
the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior
Subordinated Notes or portions of Senior Subordinated Notes called for redemption.

**REDEMPTION FOR TAXATION REASONS**

The Issuer may redeem the Senior Subordinated Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving
not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes (which
notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption
(a "Tax Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts, if any, then due
and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) which change or amendment
is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, on or after
such later date); or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official position regarding the application, administration
or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or rulings (including by virtue of a holding,
judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which
change or amendment is publicly announced and becomes effective on or after the Issue Date
(or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the
Issue Date, on or after such later date) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change
_in Tax Law"),_

the Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in
respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Issuer or such Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying
Agent where this would be reasonable). Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in
accordance with the procedures described under "—Selection and notice".

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior
to the earliest date on which the Issuer or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor would be obliged to
pay Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of
such Senior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption
and that it or the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor would not be able to avoid the obligation
to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an
independent tax counsel of recognized standing and reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts

355


-----

as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will accept such Officer's
Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described
above and compliance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, without further inquiry, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing will apply (a) to any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor only if the payment giving rise
to such requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person and
to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person is incorporated or organized or otherwise considered
to be a tax resident or maintaining a permanent establishment or doing business for Tax purposes or
any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such successor Person and any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**WITHHOLDING TAXES**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor thereto
(each, a "Payor") on the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee will
be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by:

(1) any jurisdiction in which a Payor is then incorporated, organized, or otherwise considered to be
a tax resident or maintaining a permanent establishment or doing business for tax purposes, or
any political subdivision or Governmental Authority thereof or therein having the power to tax;
or

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which any payment on any such Senior Subordinated Note or
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such Payor (including, without
limitation, the jurisdiction of any Paying Agent for the Senior Subordinated Notes), or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each
of clauses (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),

will at any time be required in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of a Payor under or with
respect to any Senior Subordinated Note or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee, including, without
limitation, payments of principal, redemption price, purchase price, premium, if any, or interest, the
Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the Holder
after such withholding, deduction or imposition (including any such deduction, withholding or imposition
in respect of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received in
respect of such payments in the absence of such withholding, deduction or imposition; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(a) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any actual or deemed present or former connection between the relevant Holder or the
beneficial owner of a Senior Subordinated Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary,
partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder or beneficial
owner, if the relevant Holder or beneficial owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited
liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including being a citizen
or resident or national or domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment, place of business or place of management in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction)
but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition or ownership of
a Senior Subordinated Note or the receipt of any payment in respect of, or the enforcement of,
the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee;

(b) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Subordinated Note to comply with a written request
of any Payor addressed to the Holder or beneficial owner (and made at a time that would enable
the Holder or beneficial owner acting reasonably to comply with that request) to comply with
any certification, information, documentation or other reporting requirements, which are
required by applicable law, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from all or part of such Taxes imposed by the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, but only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally
entitled to provide such certification, information or documentation;

356


-----

(c) any Taxes that are required to be paid other than by deduction or withholding from a payment
on the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, value added, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Tax;

(e) any Taxes imposed on a payment on a Senior Subordinated Note presented for payment
(where presentation is permitted or required for payment) to a Holder or beneficial owner who
would have been able to avoid such Taxes by presenting the relevant Senior Subordinated
Note to another Paying Agent;

(f) any Taxes imposed pursuant to or in connection with Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code
(or any amended or successor version of such sections), the Treasury regulations thereunder,
any official interpretations thereof or any similar law or regulations adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with
respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code; or

(g) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Subordinated Note
for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant
payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would
have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Subordinated Note been presented on the last
day of such 30-day period).

In addition, such Additional Amounts shall not be paid with respect to any payment to any Holder who
is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the beneficial owner of such Senior Subordinated
Notes to the extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such
partnership or the beneficial owner of such Senior Subordinated Notes would not have been entitled to
such Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Senior
Subordinated Notes directly.

The Payor or the applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and
(ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance
with applicable law. The Payor will (i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment by the Payor of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction or, if notwithstanding such Payor's efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not obtained, then such other evidence of payment of such Taxes by the Payor as is
reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and (ii) provide such certified copies
or such evidence of payment to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, within a reasonable time after
the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made. Copies of such documentation will
be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee by the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Listing Agent if the
Senior Subordinated Notes are then listed on Euronext Dublin.

If any Payor becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to
any payment made on any Senior Subordinated Note or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee, at least
30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount
so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts
to Holders or the beneficial owner on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises, or the Payor becomes aware of such obligation, less than 45 days prior to the relevant
payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable
after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will
be entitled to rely solely on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are
necessary.

Wherever there are mentioned, in any context in any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees or this Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes: (1) the
payment of principal, (2) purchase price in connection with a purchase of Senior Subordinated Notes,
(3) interest, or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, such

reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading
to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any
other excise, property or similar Taxes (including any reasonable expenses related thereto) that arise
in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, initial resale, or registration
or any payments under or with respect to any Senior Subordinated Notes, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture, any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto, or in any tax jurisdiction on the enforcement of any of the foregoing (other than on a
transfer of Senior Subordinated Notes other than the initial resale by the Initial Purchasers or any
payments under or with respect thereto, and limited, solely in the case of Taxes attributable to any
payments under or with respect thereto, to any such Taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
that are not excluded under clauses (a), (b) and (d) through (f) above, under the second and third
paragraphs under this heading or any combination thereof) and the Payor agrees to indemnify the
Holders for any such Taxes paid by or on behalf of such Holders.

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture, and any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Senior
Subordinated Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to a Payor and to any jurisdiction
in which any successor to the Payor is incorporated or otherwise considered to be a tax resident or
maintaining a permanent establishment or doing business for Tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment on the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee is made by or on behalf of such successor and any political subdivision or taxing authority
or agency thereof or therein.

**CHANGE OF CONTROL**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under
this heading "Change of Control", each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all
or any part (equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof) of such Holder's
Senior Subordinated Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of each
Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Senior
Subordinated Notes as described under this heading, "Change of Control", in the event and to the extent
that it has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Senior Subordinated Notes as
described under "—Optional redemption" and has not defaulted in the payment of the applicable
redemption price or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Subordinated Notes
as described under "—Optional redemption" and has not defaulted in the payment of the applicable
redemption price or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the
date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send a notice (the
"Change of Control Offer") to each Holder of any such Senior Subordinated Notes, by mail or otherwise
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, with a copy to
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such
Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Senior
Subordinated Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such
Senior Subordinated Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any,
to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record
date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the "Change of Control
_Payment");_

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from
the date such notice is mailed) (the "Change of Control Payment Date") and the record date;

(3) stating that any Senior Subordinated Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the
Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Senior Subordinated Notes or part thereof
not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

358


-----

(4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event;

(5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Senior Subordinated Notes
repurchased; and

(6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating
that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control
Triggering Event.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred,
the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Subordinated Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect
of all Senior Subordinated Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee an Officer's
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes or portions of
the Senior Subordinated Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global
Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Subordinated Notes or portions
thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to
be delivered), at the Issuer's expense, to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the
Change of Control Payment for such Senior Subordinated Notes, and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee will, at the Issuer's expense, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book
entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal
amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Notes surrendered, if any; provided that
each such new Senior Subordinated Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and
integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

If and for so long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and
admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, the
Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Change of Control Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland
(which is expected to be The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules,
post such notices on the official website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin).

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other
provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with
respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Senior
Subordinated Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of
a Holder's right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Senior Subordinated Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the
Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering
Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Senior Subordinated Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a
definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of
Control Offer is made.

359


-----

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior
Subordinated Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Issuer will comply
with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture by virtue
of the conflict.

The Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Subordinated Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that
constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of
Indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a
Change of Control Triggering Event under the New Revolving Credit Facility or the indenture governing
the Senior Secured Notes and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such
agreements may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture restricts the ability of the Issuer to
repurchase Senior Subordinated Notes unless the Issuer has complied, or will substantially concurrently
with the repurchase of the Senior Subordinated Notes comply, with the applicable change of control
offer provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control
Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control
Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase
the Senior Subordinated Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect
of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance
that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral— We may not have the ability_
_to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain_
_events constituting a change of control as required by the Indentures, and the change of control_
_provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain_
_important corporate events"._

In addition, the definitions of "Change of Control Triggering Event" and "Permitted Holders" expressly
permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction (i) which is a Specified Change of
Control Event or (ii) which is a Change of Control but not a Change of Control Triggering Event, in each
case without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all", there is no precise
established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
a disposition of "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be
unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make
an offer to repurchase the Senior Subordinated Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering
Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes.

**CERTAIN COVENANTS**

**Limitation on Indebtedness**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); _provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted_
Subsidiaries may Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect
thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for
the Issuer for the most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred would have
been at least 2.0 to 1.0; provided, however, that the maximum aggregate principal amount of Debt that

360


-----

may be Incurred by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors
pursuant to this paragraph (1) shall not exceed €50.0 million at any time outstanding.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and Guarantees in respect of such
Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding
the greater of (x) €50 million and (y) 48.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, _provided,_ that any
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) may be refinanced at any time if such
refinancing does not exceed the greater of (I) the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness
permitted to be Incurred pursuant to this clause (1) on the date of such refinancing and (II) the
aggregate principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced at such time (together with
an amount necessary to pay accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including
any premium and defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premiums and other costs and
expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) Incurred or payable in
connection with such refinancing);

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary in each case, so long as the Incurrence of such
Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
(other than pursuant to this clause (2)); _provided that, if Indebtedness being_
Guaranteed is subordinated to or pari passu with the Senior Subordinated Notes or a
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee, then the Guarantee must be subordinated or
_pari passu, as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness Guaranteed; and_

(b) without limiting the "—Limitation on Liens" covenant, Indebtedness arising by reason
of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person securing Indebtedness of the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is
permitted under the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture (other than
pursuant to this clause (2));

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) (1) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which
results in any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and (2) any sale or other transfer of any
such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such
Indebtedness not permitted by this clause by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary,
as the case may be; and

(b) if the Issuer or a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor is the obligor on such
Indebtedness and the obligee is not the Issuer or a Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor, such Indebtedness must be (a) unsecured and (b) except in respect of
intercompany current liabilities Incurred in the ordinary course of business, if the
aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness of the Issuer or such Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor exceeds €2.5 million, to the extent legally permitted
expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect
to the Senior Subordinated Notes or the applicable Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee, in the case of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors and such
condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if each such obligee accedes to the New
Intercreditor Agreement as an Intra-Group Lender (as defined in the New Intercreditor
Agreement);

(4) (a) Indebtedness represented by the Senior Subordinated Notes (other than any Additional
Senior Subordinated Notes) and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees thereof and
Indebtedness represented by the Senior Secured Notes (other than any Additional Senior
Secured Notes, as defined in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes") and the Senior
Secured Notes Guarantees (as defined in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes") thereof,
(b) any Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1), (3), (4)(a) and (16) of
this paragraph) entered into or outstanding on the Issue Date, (c) Refinancing Indebtedness

Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in sub- clauses (a), (b) and (c) of this clause
(4) or clause (5) of this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant

(5) Indebtedness of (x) the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries Incurred to finance an
acquisition or (y) Persons that are acquired by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
or merged, consolidated, amalgamated with or into the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture;
_provided, however, that after giving effect to such acquisition or merger, consolidation or_
amalgamation either: (a) the Issuer would be permitted to Incur at least €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph
of this covenant; or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Issuer would not be less than
it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or merger, consolidation or
amalgamation;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for _bona fide_ hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by an Officer or the
Board of Directors of the Issuer);

(7) Indebtedness consisting of (A) Capitalized Lease Obligations, mortgage financings, Purchase
Money Obligations or other financings, Incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of

rental or cost of design, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal)
or equipment that is used or useful in a Similar Business, whether through the direct purchase
of assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets, and any Indebtedness which
refinances, replaces or refunds such Indebtedness (provided that, in each case, the
Indebtedness exists on the date of such purchase, lease, rental, construction, design,
installation or improvement or is created within 180 days thereafter), in an aggregate
outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any
time outstanding the greater of (x) €15 million and (y) 14.4% of Consolidated EBITDA;

the equity (other than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference
Shares, an Excluded Contribution or a Parent Debt Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case,

-----

(16) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consisting of leases (including

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion,
will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the
second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided_ that (a) all Indebtedness
outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially Incurred under
clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b)
of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant, and may not be reclassified and
(b) all Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph
of this covenant that is secured by Liens on Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral that is
accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral under the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph may not be
reclassified;

(2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments
are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause
(1), (7), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters
of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then
such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greatest of (x) the maximum
mandatory redemption, (y) repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or
repurchase premium) and (z) the liquidation preference thereof;

(5) when calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture, in each case in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of
determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option
of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are
entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of
determining the ability to consummate any such Limited Condition Acquisition (and not for
purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the avoidance of doubt, (x)
if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio
(including due to fluctuations in EBITDA of the Issuer or the target company) subsequent to
such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited Condition
Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of
such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition
and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not
be tested at the time of consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related
transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer elects to have such determinations occur at the
time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions (including any Incurrence of
Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date
the definitive agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating
any baskets or ratios under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition; and

364


-----

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and
in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment
of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the
reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under
this "—Limitation on Indebtedness". The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will
be: (i) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in
respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS and (ii) the principal amount of the Indebtedness,
in the case of any other Indebtedness. For the purposes of determining any particular amount of
Indebtedness under this "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, obligations with respect to letters of
credit, Guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the
determination of such particular amount will not be included.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date
(and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described
under this "—Limitation on Indebtedness", the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in
another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of
Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would
cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency
exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness
does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the Euro Equivalent
of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such
Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with
respect to euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of
any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to
the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

**Limitation on Layered Indebtedness**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor to, Incur any
Indebtedness that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Issuer
or such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor, unless (a) if such Indebtedness is only contractually
subordinated to Indebtedness to which the Senior Secured Notes or such Subsidiary Guarantor’s
Guarantee is contractually subordinated, such Indebtedness ranks _pari passu with the Senior_
Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of such Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor, as applicable, or (b) such Indebtedness is contractually subordinated in right of payment to
the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of such Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor, as applicable; provided that (i) no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness solely by virtue of being
unsecured or (ii) no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment
to any other Indebtedness, subject to the priority with respect to distributions of proceeds of any
enforcement of Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral or any other collateral of secured Indebtedness
as set out in the New Intercreditor Agreement.

disposition to a Person other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary

Subsidiaries (valued, in each case, as provided in the definition of
"Investment") not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted
Subsidiary, the amount of Investments previously made by the Issuer

employees to the extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary) of Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer; and

_provided,_ _however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer's option)

Specified Change of Control Event; further provided that notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) any amounts (such amounts, the "Excluded Amounts") that would otherwise be
included in the calculation of the amount available for Restricted Payments pursuant to
the preceding clause (c) will be excluded to the extent (1) such amounts result from the
receipt of Net Cash Proceeds or marketable securities received from the Initial
Investors in contemplation of, or in connection with, an event that would otherwise
constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event, (2) the purpose of the receipt of such

Leverage Ratio so that there would be an occurrence of a Specified Change of Control
Event that would not have been achieved without the receipt of such Net Cash
Proceeds or marketable securities and (3) no Change of Control Offer is made in
connection with such Change of Control Triggering Event in accordance with the
requirements of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and (y) Excluded Amounts

received in excess thereof shall not constitute Excluded Amounts.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be
the fair market value thereof as determined conclusively by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the
Issuer acting in good faith; provided that any determination of the fair market value of such property or
assets in excess of €10 million shall be made solely by the Board of Directors of the Issuer.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, "Permitted Payments"):

Issuer; provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net Cash Proceeds, or fair market

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur
or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property or assets (including
Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), in each case whether owned on the Issue Date
or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is
securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the "Initial Lien"), except (a) in the case of any property or asset
that does not constitute Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on
property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture (or a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens of a
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or, if such
Indebtedness constitutes Senior Indebtedness, subordinated to, or, in the case of Liens with respect to
Subordinated Indebtedness, prior to the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as such
Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Senior Subordinated Notes will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which
it relates, and (ii) otherwise as set forth under "—Security—Release of Liens".

**Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit

Issuer or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall
not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the New Revolving
Credit Facility); or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect at or entered
into on the Issue Date, and any amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals,
supplements, refunding, replacements or refinancings of those agreements referred to in
clauses (a) and (b); provided that such amendments, restatements, modifications, renewals,
supplements, refunding, replacements or refinancings are not materially more restrictive, taken
as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payments restrictions than those contained
in those agreements on the Issue Date, as applicable (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer);

**Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be
determined on the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in
good faith by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and/or assets
subject to such Asset Disposition (including, and for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset
Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap); and

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by
the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash
Equivalents or Temporary Cash Investments.

After the receipt of Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition, the Issuer (or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply an amount equal to such Net Available Cash (at the option
of the Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary):

(a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary; (ii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Pari Passu
Indebtedness that is secured in whole or in part by a Lien on the Senior Subordinated
Notes Collateral which Lien ranks _pari passu_ with the Liens securing the Senior
Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees at a price of no
more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or
redemption so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes an offer on a
_pro rata basis to all Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes at a purchase price equal_
to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to (but not including) the date
of purchase; (iii) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Issuer or a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); or (iv) to purchase the Senior Subordinated Notes
pursuant to an offer to all Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes,
_plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to_
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date);

374


-----

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or purchase
or commit to invest in or purchase Additional Assets (including by means of an
investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash
received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer) within 365 days from
the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and (ii) the receipt of such Net
Available Cash; _provided, however, that any such reinvestment in Additional Assets_
made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or pursuant to a commitment
approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within
such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated
within 180 days of such 365th day;

(c) to make a capital expenditure within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of such
Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that any such capital expenditure made pursuant to a definitive binding agreement or
a commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or
approved within such time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is
consummated within 180 days of such 365th day; or

(d) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a), (b), (c) or (d) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness
or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture.

If an amount less than the Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions is applied or invested or
committed to be applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph, an amount equal to the
difference will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds". On the 366th day (or the 546th day, in the
case of any Net Available Cash committed to be used pursuant to pursuant to a definitive binding
agreement or commitment approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer pursuant to clauses (b) or
(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant), after the later of (A) the date of such Asset Disposition
and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds
€20 million, the Issuer will be required within ten Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset
_Disposition Offer") to all Holders of Senior Subordinated Notes and, to the extent the Issuer elects, to_
all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount
of Senior Subordinated Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition
Offer applies that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the
Senior Subordinated Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness,
an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes and
100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, _plus accrued and unpaid_
interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth
in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness,
as applicable, and in the case of the Senior Subordinated Notes, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Disposition Offer prior
to the expiration of the 365-day period mentioned above.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes,
subject to other covenants contained in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by
Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Senior
Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of
the aggregate principal amount of tendered Senior Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness,
or by such other method as (i) the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and (ii) the trustee, agent or
similar representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, after consultation with the Issuer, deem fair
and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal, depositary and exchange
requirements). For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not
denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts
into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset

375


-----

Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount
of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall not have any
liability in connection with any method elected under this paragraph.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Subordinated
Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Subordinated
Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Subordinated Notes shall
not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Subordinated Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available
Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Senior Subordinated Notes, will remain open
for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition
_Offer Period"). No later than five (5) Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer_
Period (the "Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior
Subordinated Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be purchased by
it pursuant to this covenant (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition
Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior
Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Subordinated Notes and Pari
Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition
Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn, all Senior Subordinated Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Senior Subordinated Notes, in minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Subordinated Notes or
portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant.
The Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five
Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering
Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Subordinated
Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for
purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Senior Subordinated Note (or amend the applicable
Global Note), and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer's Certificate from
the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book entry) such new
Senior Subordinated Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of
the Senior Subordinated Note surrendered; provided that each such new Senior Subordinated Note will
be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000
in excess thereof. Any Senior Subordinated Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered
(or transferred by book entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to
be cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer or other liabilities (other than
contingent liabilities) recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary or other liabilities (other
than contingent liabilities) recorded on the balance sheet of such Restricted Subsidiary and the
release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in
connection with such Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into
cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result
of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer are released from any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of payment of such
Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition;

376


-----

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons
who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, as determined in good faith
by an Officer or the Board of Directors of the Issuer, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not
to exceed the greater of (x) €10 million and (y) 9.6% of Consolidated EBITDA (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior
Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**Limitation on Affiliate Transactions**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being "Affiliate Transactions") involving aggregate value in
excess of €5 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in
a comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement
providing for such transaction in arm's length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate;
and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €10 million, the
terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution
of the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer resolving that such
transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the "—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments" covenant, any Permitted Payments or any Permitted Investment (other than_
Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect in the good faith
judgment of the Issuer and the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other

or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable than those that could
reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would

_and consolidation—The Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors" covenant and the Senior_
Subordinated Notes Indenture;

(14) other activities not specifically enumerated above that are incidental to the foregoing or are de
_minimis in nature or consistent with activities undertaken on the Issue Date; or_

(15) from time to time, receipt in a transaction otherwise permitted under the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents or the security
documents with respect to the Senior Secured Notes of properties and assets (including cash,
Cash Equivalents, Temporary Cash Investments, shares of Capital Stock of another Person
and/or Indebtedness and other obligations) for the purpose of transferring such properties and
assets to any Parent Entity, any Subsidiary or any other Person, so long as in any case such
further transfer is made promptly by the Issuer.

**Reports**

For so long as any Senior Subordinated Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Issuer beginning with the year ending
July 31, 2021, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a)
audited consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal
years and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer
for the three most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements
and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) unaudited pro forma
income statement information and balance sheet information of the Issuer (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall not include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet
to the extent not reasonably available), together with explanatory footnotes, for any material
acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred since the beginning of the most
recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity
and capital resources of the Issuer, and a discussion of material commitments and
contingencies and critical accounting policies; (d) description of the business, management and
shareholders of the Issuer, all material affiliate transactions and a description of all material

380


-----

contractual arrangements, including material debt instruments; and (e) a description of material
risk factors and material recent developments;

(2) within 60 days following the end of the first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year of the Issuer
beginning with the quarter ending April 30, 2021, all quarterly reports of the Issuer containing
the following information: (a) an unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of the end
of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most
recent year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, and the
comparable prior year periods, together with condensed footnote disclosure; (b) unaudited pro
_forma income statement information and balance sheet information, together with explanatory_
footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalizations that have occurred
since the beginning of the relevant fiscal quarter (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not
include the provision of a full income statement or balance sheet to the extent not reasonably
available); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including
a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition, EBITDA and material changes in
liquidity and capital resources, and a discussion of material changes not in the ordinary course
of business in commitments and contingencies since the most recent report; and (d) material
recent developments and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent
annual report; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of any material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or
similar transaction, or any change in the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer or
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Issuer or change in auditors of the Issuer, or any
other material event that the Issuer announces publicly, a report containing a description of
such event.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS as in effect on the date
of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of IFRS as then in effect) and on a
consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above may in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied
to such periods. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Except as provided for above, no report need include
separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect
to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in the
Offering Memorandum. In addition, no financial information required pursuant to clause (1) above need
be audited if not presented on an audited basis by the Issuer in its financial statements included in the
Offering Memorandum.

At any time that any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by the
first two clauses of this covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on
the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of
operations of the Group separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or (ii) standalone audited or unaudited financial statements, as
the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise)
together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries,
which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue, EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets,
total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may satisfy its obligations under clauses (1) and (2) of the
first paragraph of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly
reports of any Parent Entity or any new holding company created following a Permitted Reorganization.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee of the reports
specified in (1), (2) and (3) above, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
post copies of such reports on such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as
determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it
cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding clause (a) owing to
applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish such reports to the Holders
and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes. In the event that (i)
the Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange

381


-----

Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by
Section 13 (a) with the SEC or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee
reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting
requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of IFRS
information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as
it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC
pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding five paragraphs.

For so long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin for trading
on the Global Exchange Market, and the rules of that exchange so require, copies of the Issuer's
organizational documents and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the most recent
consolidated financial statements published by the Issuer may be inspected and obtained at the office
of the Paying Agent in Ireland. See "—Listing and general information".

In addition, so long as the Senior Subordinated Notes remain outstanding and during any period during
which the Issuer is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom
pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective
purchasers of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule
144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

In the event that, and for so long as, the equity securities of the Issuer or any Parent Entity are listed
on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (or one of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the
UK) and the Issuer or such Parent Entity is subject to the Admission and Disclosure Standards
applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris
(or the equivalent standards applicable to issuers of equity securities admitted to trading on one or more
of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the UK), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make
available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Issuer
or such Parent Entity is, or would be, required to file with Euronext Paris pursuant to such Admission
and Disclosure Standards (or the applicable standards of one or more of the equivalent regulated
markets in the EU or the UK, as applicable). Upon complying with the foregoing requirements, and
provided, that such requirements require the Issuer or any Parent Entity to prepare and file annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the regulated market of Euronext Paris, or one
or more of the equivalent regulated markets in the EU or the UK, as applicable, and provided that the
Issuer or such Parent Entity additionally provides the reports set forth in paragraph (2) above with
respect to its first and third fiscal quarters, the Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

**Merger and consolidation**

_The Issuer_

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose all or substantially all its assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction
or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") (if not the Issuer) will
be a Person organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the Pre-Expansion
European Union, Switzerland, Canada or the United States of America, any State of the United
States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Issuer) will expressly
assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, all
the obligations of the Issuer under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the New Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a
result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such
Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing;

382


-----

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
"—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be
less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and
such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and
that all conditions precedent in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture relating to such
consolidation, merger or transfer have been satisfied and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered
and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company and
that all conditions precedent in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture relating to such
consolidation, merger or transfer have been satisfied (in each case, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee); provided that in giving an
Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is
deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result
of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant._

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which
properties and assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to
be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of the Issuer under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, notwithstanding clause (4)
of the first paragraph of this covenant (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this sentence),
(a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer and (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may
consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to
any other Restricted Subsidiary that is a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor and (c) any Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine
with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted Subsidiary that
is not a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor. Notwithstanding the preceding clause (3) (which does
not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise
combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal
domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of
the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
"—Merger and consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to the creation of a new subsidiary as a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

_The Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors_

None of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors (other than a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
whose Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor is the surviving corporation),

383


-----

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all its assets as
an entirety or substantially as an entirety, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
to any Person, or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless

(A) the other Person is the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor or becomes a Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor; or

(B) (1) either (x) a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor is the continuing
Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person expressly assumes
all of the obligations of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor under its
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee) and all
obligations of the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor under the New
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents to which it is a party; and (2) immediately after giving effect
to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is
continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way
of consolidation or merger) of a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor or the
sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantor (in each case other than to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
and the proceeds therefrom are applied as required by the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture.

Notwithstanding the preceding clause (B)(2) (which does not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence), (a) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor or the Issuer
and (b) any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge
into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
or the Issuer.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this "—Merger and consolidation" covenant
will not apply to any transaction or arrangement that is a Permitted Reorganization.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

**Suspension of covenants on achievement of investment grade status**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Subordinated Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then,
the Issuer shall notify the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee in writing of these events and beginning
on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Subordinated Notes cease to
have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Subordinated Notes: "—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments", "—Limitation on Indebtedness", "—Limitation on restrictions on_
_distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries", "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions", "—Limitation on_
_sales of assets and subsidiary stock", "—Impairment of Security Interest" and the provisions of clause_
(3) of the first paragraph of the "—Merger and consolidation" covenant and, in each case, any related
default provision of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event,
the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset to zero.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of
any effect with regard to actions of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during
the continuance of the Suspension Event, and (i) the "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant
will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture

384


-----

other than during the period beginning with the Suspension Event and ending on the Reversion Date,
(ii) any transactions prohibited by the "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" covenant entered into after
such reinstatement pursuant to an agreement entered into during the continuance of the Suspension
Event shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (6) of the second paragraph of the "—
_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" covenant, (iii) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of the_
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of the first
paragraph of the "—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries" covenant
that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to
clause (1) or (12) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on restrictions on distributions from
_Restricted Subsidiaries" covenant and (iv) all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the_
Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer's option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant or one of the clauses set forth in the second
paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be Incurred
thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to the Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not
be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the "—Limitation on Indebtedness"
covenant, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is
classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the "—Limitation on
_Indebtedness" covenant. The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall not be obliged to notify holders_
of a Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**Impairment of Security Interest**

The Issuer and any other Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the result of materially
impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral (it being
understood that the Incurrence of Liens on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral permitted by the
definition of "Permitted Collateral Liens" and the implementation of any Permitted Reorganization shall
under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral); and the Issuer and any other Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor
shall not, and the Issuer shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Holders and/or the
other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the New Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any Lien in any of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral;
_provided_ that (a) the Issuer and the Issuer's Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral
Liens or implement any Permitted Reorganization and (b) the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral
may be discharged, amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, replaced or released in
accordance with the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents and the
New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; _provided, however, that,_
subject to the foregoing proviso, the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed,
restated or otherwise modified or replaced to (i) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
therein; (ii) provide for Permitted Collateral Liens or implement any Permitted Reorganization; (iii)
amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents, for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization; (iv) provide for the release of
any Security Interest on any properties and assets constituting Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral
from the Lien of the Security Documents; provided that such release is followed by the substantially
concurrent retaking of a Lien of at least equivalent priority over the same properties and assets securing
the Senior Subordinated Notes or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee; (v) add to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Collateral; (vi) comply with the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; (vii) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor and the assumption by such successor of the obligations under
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes, the applicable Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantee and the Security Documents, in each case, in accordance with the "—
_Merger and consolidation" covenant; or (viii) evidence and provide for the acceptance of the_
appointment of a successor trustee or Security Agent; provided that, contemporaneously with any such
action in clauses (ii) and (iii), the Issuer delivers to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, (1) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the person granting such
Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, modification, replacement or release, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the
relevant Person which confirms the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest after giving

385


-----

effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification,
replacement or release, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification, replacement or release, the Lien or
Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, modified,
replaced or released are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new
hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately
prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, modification, replacement or release. In the
event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent
to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection
with the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Designated Senior Indebtedness
or any Indebtedness that is permitted to share the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral pursuant to
the definition of "Permitted Collateral Lien", the Issuer, the relevant Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantors, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the
holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized Representatives) an intercreditor agreement, or
a restatement, amendment or other modification of an existing intercreditor agreement (an "Additional
_Intercreditor Agreement"), on substantially the same terms as the New Intercreditor Agreement (or_
terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including with respect to the subordination, payment
blockage, limitation on enforcement and release of Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, priority and
release of any Security Interest in respect of the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral; provided, further,
that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Security Agent or adversely affect the personal rights, duties,
liabilities, powers, protections or immunities of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security
Agent under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, subject to the foregoing and the succeeding paragraph, any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement may provide for _pari passu_ security interests in respect of any such
Indebtedness (to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted to share the Senior Subordinated Notes
Collateral pursuant to the definition of "Permitted Collateral Liens").

At the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of the Holders, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent will from time to time enter into one or more amendments to the New
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (i) cure any ambiguity, omission,
defect or inconsistency therein; (ii) add Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors or other parties (such
as representatives of new issuances of Indebtedness) thereto; (iii) further secure the Senior
Subordinated Notes (including Additional Senior Subordinated Notes); (iv) make provision for equal and
ratable grants of Liens on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral to secure Additional Senior
Subordinated Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens; (v) to enable any Permitted
Reorganization; (vi) subject to the preceding paragraph, to provide for additional Indebtedness
(including with respect to any New Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior
Subordinated Notes) to the extent permitted under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) or any
other obligations that are permitted by the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture to be
Incurred and secured by a Lien on the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral on a senior, pari passu or
junior basis with the Liens securing the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantees; (vii) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the New Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement; (viii) amend the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof; (ix) increase the amount of the Credit Facilities
covered by any such agreement, the Incurrence of which is not prohibited by the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture; or (x) make any other change thereto that does not adversely affect the rights of the
Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes in any material respect. The Issuer will not otherwise direct
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the New
Intercreditor Agreement or, if applicable, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, without the consent of
the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then
outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below under "—Amendments and waivers", and the Issuer
may only direct the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Senior Subordinated Notes

386


-----

Trustee or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, powers, protections
or immunities under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the New Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Each Holder of a Senior Subordinated Note, by accepting such Senior Subordinated Note, will be
deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent from
time to time to give effect to such provisions;

(2) authorized each of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent from time to
time to become a party to any additional intercreditor arrangements described above;

(3) agreed to be bound by such provisions and the provisions of any additional intercreditor
arrangements described above; and

(4) irrevocably appointed the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent to act on
its behalf from time to time to enter into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of
any additional intercreditor arrangements described above, in each case, without the need for
the consent of the Holders.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the New Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee (and the
Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment,
purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations
subordinated to the Senior Subordinated Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would
comply with the "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant.

**Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees**

No Restricted Subsidiary (other than a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor) shall Guarantee the
payment of, assume or in any manner become obligated under or with respect to any Indebtedness of
the Issuer or a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes
an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor on the date on which such other Guarantee or
Indebtedness is Incurred (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter) and, if applicable, executes
and delivers to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the
form attached to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary
will provide an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee (which Additional Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantee shall be senior to or _pari passu_ with, or, if such Indebtedness constitutes Senior
Indebtedness, subordinated to, such Restricted Subsidiary's Guarantee of such other Indebtedness).

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraphs in this covenant,

(1) an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor's Additional Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee shall not be required to the extent it could result in (A) any breach or violation of
statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalization rules, transfer pricing rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination
rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (B)
any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
(C) any material cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but
excluding any obligation under the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee itself) that cannot be
avoided by commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer other than reasonable
out of pocket expenses; or (D) any inconsistency with the Agreed Security Principles (but, in
the case of (A), each of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to overcome the relevant legal limitation and will procure that the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures which are legally
available to eliminate the relevant limit); and

(2) for so long as it is not permissible under applicable law or regulation for a Restricted Subsidiary
to become an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor, such Restricted Subsidiary
need not become an Additional Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor (but, in such a case,
each of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will use their commercially reasonable efforts
to overcome the relevant legal prohibition precluding the giving of the Guarantee and will

387


-----

procure that the relevant Restricted Subsidiary undertakes all whitewash or similar procedures
which are legally available to eliminate the relevant legal prohibition, and shall give such
Guarantee at such time (and to the extent) that it thereafter becomes permissible).

The first paragraph of this covenant shall not apply to: (1) the granting by such Restricted Subsidiary of
a Permitted Lien under circumstances which do not otherwise constitute the Guarantee of Indebtedness
of the Issuer; (2) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness that refinances
Indebtedness which benefited from a Guarantee by any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in compliance
with this covenant immediately prior to such refinancing; (3) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary
that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary if the Guarantee was not Incurred
in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and the terms
of such Guarantee prohibit the relevant Restricted Subsidiary from becoming an Additional Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor; (4) Guarantees by any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness Incurred
under the New Revolving Credit Facility which are in effect on the Issue Date; (5) Guarantees given by
any Restricted Subsidiary to a bank or trust company incorporated in any member state of the European
Union as of the date of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or any commercial banking institution
that is a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (or any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof), in
each case having combined capital and surplus and undivided profits of not less than €500 million,
whose debt has a rating, at the time such Guarantee was given, of at least A or the equivalent thereof
by S&P and at least A2 or the equivalent thereof by Moody's, in connection with the operation of cash
management programs established for the Issuer's benefit or that of any Restricted Subsidiary and (6)
the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, including in respect of Additional Senior Secured Notes, which
are in effect on the Issue Date.

Each such Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defenses generally available to
the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar
laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under
applicable law.

Each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee shall be released in accordance with the provisions of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement described under "—Senior
_Subordinated Notes Guarantees" and "Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other_
_Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement"._

**LIMITATION ON ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 3AB** **OPTIQUE DÉVELOPPEMENT PROCEEDS LOAN**

(1) The Issuer shall not sell, assign or otherwise transfer or forgive or waive any principal amount of the
3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan (other than to secure the Senior Subordinated Notes, any
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee or the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or to grant Permitted
Collateral Liens);

(2) Neither the Issuer nor 3AB Optique Développement shall (i) amend the 3AB Optique Développement
Proceeds Loan in a manner adverse in any material respect to the Holders (as determined in good faith
by the Issuer), other than any amendment to the interest terms including the interest rates payable
thereunder or (ii) shorten the maturity of the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan to a date
prior to the Stated Maturity of the Senior Subordinated Notes unless the maturity of the corresponding
Senior Subordinated Notes is also similarly shortened; _provided that any amendment to the 3AB_
Optique Développement Proceeds Loan shall be permitted from time to time to align the redemption
provisions, maturity, covenants or any other terms thereof to the corresponding terms of the Senior
Subordinated Notes initially issued on the Issue Date (as may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time); and

(3) The Issuer shall not receive or accept any repayment or prepayment of principal in respect of the
3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan prior to its maturity or convert the 3AB Optique
Développement Proceeds Loan into equity of 3AB Optique Développement or otherwise reduce the
outstanding principal amount thereof except to pay interest, premium or Additional Amounts with
respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Secured Notes or to facilitate or accommodate
or reflect a repayment, redemption or repurchase of outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes or Senior
Secured Notes; provided that the amount of any such repayment, prepayment, conversion or reduction
of principal amount of the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan shall be no greater than the
interest, premium, Additional Amounts or principal amount of any corresponding Senior Subordinated
Notes or the Senior Secured Notes being paid, repaid, redeemed or prepaid.

388


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan may be canceled,
forgiven or otherwise repaid, released or discharged upon:

(a) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital
Stock of 3AB Optique Développement (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture and 3AB Optique Développement ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary as a
result of the sale or other disposition;

(b) the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of 3AB Optique Développement
(other than to the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), if the sale or other disposition
does not violate the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture;

(c) [Reserved];

(d) defeasance or discharge of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as provided in “—Defeasance”
and “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(e) in accordance with the provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as described under “—Amendments and waivers”;

(g) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Merger and consolidation”; and

(h) to the extent such cancellation, forgiveness, repayment, release or discharge, whether by
capitalization or otherwise, is necessary to pay any applicable Taxes or to comply with
applicable tax regulations regarding the deductibility of interest expense (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of senior management of the Issuer).

The Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all necessary actions
reasonably requested by the Issuer, including the granting of releases or waivers under the New
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any repayment or
release of the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan in accordance with these provisions,
subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be
effected by the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent without the consent (except
to the extent required under clause (f) above) of or liability to the Holders or any other action or consent
on the part of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Security Agent.

**PAYMENTS FOR CONSENT**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any holder of Senior Subordinated Notes for
or as an inducement to any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms of the provisions of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes unless such consideration is
offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes that consent, waive or
agree to amend in the time frame set forth in the solicitation documents relating to such consent, waiver
or agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be
permitted, in any offer or payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or
amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the Senior
Subordinated Notes, to exclude holders of Senior Subordinated Notes in any jurisdiction where (a) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an offer to purchase for
cash, or (b) the payment of the consideration therefor would require the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document under any applicable
securities laws (including, but not limited to, the United States federal securities laws and the laws of
the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer in its sole discretion determines (acting in
good faith) (x) would be materially burdensome (it being understood that it would not be materially
burdensome to file the consent document(s) used in other jurisdictions, any substantially similar
documents or any summary thereof with the securities or financial services authorities in such
jurisdiction); or (y) such solicitation would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such
jurisdiction.

**EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture:

389


-----

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Subordinated Note issued under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days, whether or not
prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the
New Intercreditor Agreement;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Subordinated
Note issued under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture when due at its stated maturity,
upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, whether
or not prohibited by the subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
or the New Intercreditor Agreement;

(3) failure by the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors, the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to comply for 30 days after notice by the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or
the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Subordinated Notes with any of its obligations under "—Change of Control" above or under the
covenants described under "—Certain covenants" above (in each case, other than a failure to
purchase Senior Subordinated Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2)
above);

(4) failure by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes with its other agreements contained in
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and Security Documents;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by
which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee now exists,
or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness,
immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness
("payment default"); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross
_acceleration provision"),_

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
payment default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €20
million or more;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
"bankruptcy provisions");

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer), would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of €20 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for),
which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment
becomes final (the "judgment default provision");

(8) any Security Interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the New
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture) with respect to Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral having a fair market
value in excess of €30 million for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations
under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the release of any such Security Interest in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents or any such
Security Interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or any grantor

390


-----

of a Lien over the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral shall assert in writing that any such
Security Interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for 10 days (the
"security default provisions"); and

(9) any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (or a group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that are Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors that, taken together (as of the
latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer) would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary) ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of such
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee or the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) or is
declared invalid or unenforceable in a judicial proceeding or any Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee and any such Default continues for 10 days (the "guarantee provisions").

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure
such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after
receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least
25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee, may, and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare
the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Subordinated Notes
under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such
principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event
of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes because an Event of Default described
in clause (5) under "—Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration
of the Senior Subordinated Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have
been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if
(1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except
nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Subordinated Notes will become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not enforce the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
or the Senior Subordinated Notes except as provided in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and
may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the New
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes
under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of
Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if
any, which may only be waived with the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes) and rescind any such acceleration with
respect to such Senior Subordinated Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with
any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders
have offered to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee
has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce

391


-----

the right to receive payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, when due, no Holder may pursue
any remedy with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or the Senior Subordinated Notes
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee notice that an Event
of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated
Notes have requested the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered in writing the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after
the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Subordinated
Notes have not given the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Senior Subordinated Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or of exercising any
trust or power conferred on the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee.

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers
to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the
Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture or that the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee determines is
unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture,
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will be entitled to receive indemnification and/or security
satisfactory (including by way of pre-funding) to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and
expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will
provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer.
Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any
Note, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust
officers of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in
the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee,
within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of
any events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer
is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Subordinated Notes provide for the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee to take action on
behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if Holders have offered to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee, and the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee has received, indemnity
and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion. It may not be
possible for the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Senior
Subordinated Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee
will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders
to take action directly.

**AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Senior Subordinated Notes Documents may be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection
with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Subordinated Notes) and, subject to

392


-----

certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or
exchange offer for, Senior Subordinated Notes). However, without the consent of Holders holding not
less than 90% (or in the case of clause (8) below, 80%) of the then outstanding principal amount of
Senior Subordinated Notes affected, (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Subordinated Notes), an amendment or waiver may not, with
respect to any Senior Subordinated Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Subordinated Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Subordinated Note or change
the time at which any Senior Subordinated Note may be redeemed, in each case as described
above under "—Optional Redemption" or "—Redemption for taxation reasons";

(5) make any Senior Subordinated Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior
Subordinated Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Senior Subordinated Notes on or after the due dates therefor
or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's
Senior Subordinated Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture described under
"—Withholding taxes" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Subordinated
Notes in any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Subordinated Notes in a way
that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an
exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the
Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) release all or substantially all the Security Interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the
Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Security
Documents, the New Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Subordinated Notes (except pursuant to a
rescission of acceleration of the Senior Subordinated Notes by the Holders of at least a majority
in aggregate principal amount of such Senior Subordinated Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(10) release any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor from any of its obligations (or modify such
obligations in any manner adverse to the Holders) under any Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee or the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, as applicable, except in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement
and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Senior
Subordinated Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer or any Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor under any Senior Subordinated Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee for the benefit of
the Holders or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

393


-----

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee or the Holders or does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee or any of the Holders in any material respect under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance
of Additional Senior Subordinated Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee in
accordance with the "Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" covenant, to add Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes, to add security
to or for the benefit of the Senior Subordinated Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release,
termination, discharge or retaking of any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee or Lien
(including the Senior Subordinated Notes Collateral and the Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Subordinated Notes when
such release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is permitted under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the New Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Senior Subordinated Notes to any provision of this
Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes to the extent that such provision in this
Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes was intended to be a verbatim recitation of a
provision of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, a Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantee,
the Security Documents or the Senior Subordinated Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture, the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of
a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for
the accession by the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee or Security Agent to any Senior
Subordinated Notes Document; or

(9) as provided in "—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" and "—Impairment of Security Interest".

In formulating its decision on such matters, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall be entitled to
require and rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel, which shall be conclusive.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture to approve
the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance
of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Subordinated Notes given in connection with a tender of such
Holder's Senior Subordinated Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext
Dublin and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will inform Euronext Dublin of any of the
foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and publish a notice of any of the foregoing
amendments, supplements and waivers on the website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
of Euronext Dublin.

**ACTS BY HOLDERS**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Notes
have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Subordinated Notes owned by the Issuer
or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common
control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**DEFEASANCE**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all of its and each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor's
obligations under the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture ("legal
_defeasance") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations,_
including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and
indemnities of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and the Security Agent and the obligations of the
Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Subordinated

394


-----

Notes, registration of Senior Subordinated Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior
Subordinated Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security
payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the
Security Documents will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its and each Restricted Subsidiary's obligations under the
covenants described under "—Certain covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) of "—Certain
_covenants—Merger and consolidation") and "—Change of Control" and the default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under "—Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross default upon
a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the
Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the
security default provision described under "—Events of Default" above ("covenant defeasance").

The Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior
exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment
of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect
to such Senior Subordinated Notes. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect
to the Senior Subordinated Notes, payment of the Senior Subordinated Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of
the "—Merger and consolidation—The Issuer" covenant), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) under "—Events
_of Default" above._

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the
"defeasance trust") with the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee cash in euro or euro-denominated
European Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if
any, and interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and

income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have
been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law);

**SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE**

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee and
the Holders under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents will be discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights
of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Subordinated Notes, as expressly provided for in
the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes when (1)
either (a) all the Senior Subordinated Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain
lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Subordinated Notes, and certain Senior Subordinated Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer)

to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Senior

or caused to be deposited with the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, cash in euro or eurodenominated European Government Obligations, or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Subordinated Notes not previously
delivered to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Subordinated Notes that have become due and

Subordinated Notes Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each to the effect that
all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and discharge" section of the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture
have been complied with; provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to
matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

**NO PERSONAL LIABILITY OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS**

No director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary under the Senior Subordinated Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior
Subordinated Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive
liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is
against public policy.

**LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION**

Application will be made to list the Senior Subordinated Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin
and to admit the Senior Subordinated Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market. The Issuer may
also choose to list on another recognized stock exchange. There can be no assurance that the
application to list the Senior Subordinated Notes on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin
and to admit the Senior Subordinated Notes to trading on the Global Exchange Market will be approved,
and settlement of the Senior Subordinated Notes is not conditioned on obtaining this listing. If and so
long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to
trading on the Global Exchange Market, the Issuer will maintain a listing, paying and transfer agent in
Ireland with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes. See "—Certain covenants—Maintenance of
_Listing"._

So long as the Senior Subordinated Notes are listed on the Global Exchange Market of Euronext Dublin
and the rules of Euronext Dublin shall so require, copies, current and future, of all of the Issuer's annual
audited consolidated and unconsolidated financial statements, the Issuer's unaudited consolidated
interim quarterly financial statements and this Offering Memorandum may be obtained, free of charge,
during normal business hours at the registered office of the Issuer.

**CONCERNING THE SENIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES TRUSTEE AND CERTAIN AGENTS**

U.S. Bank Trustees Limited is to be appointed as Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee under the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture. The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will provide that, except
during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Senior Subordinated
Notes Trustee has been informed in writing, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee has been informed in writing, the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee will exercise such of the
rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture and use the same degree
of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the
Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior
Subordinated Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Subordinated Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to
the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee on behalf of the Holders, subject to certain exceptions.

396


-----

The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee with thirty (30) days of
becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee, should
it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and
Subsidiaries.

Any removal or resignation of the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee shall not become effective until
the acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee. The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture will
contain provisions for the indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) of the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee by the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors for any loss,
liability, taxes or expenses Incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior Subordinated Notes
Indenture.

**NOTICES**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register
of the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any of the Senior
Subordinated Notes are listed on Euronext Dublin and the rules of such Stock Exchange shall so
require, notices with respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes will be published in a newspaper having
general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be _The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the_
manner permitted by such rules, posted on the official website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin). In addition, for so long as any Senior Subordinated
Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders will be delivered to Euroclear and
Clearstream, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests. Such notices
may also be published on the website of Euronext Dublin
(https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules
of Euronext Dublin. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such other
manner, and shall be deemed to have given, on such date, as the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee
may approve.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to
such Person by first class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder
if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any
defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is
mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

**PRESCRIPTION**

Claims against the Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Subordinated Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due
date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer or any Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor for
the payment of interest on the Senior Subordinated Notes will be prescribed five years after the
applicable due date for payment of interest.

**CURRENCY INDEMNITY AND CALCULATION OF EURO-DENOMINATED RESTRICTIONS**

Euro is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuer and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Subordinated Notes and the
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received
or recovered in a currency other than euro, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or
order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Senior Subordinated Notes
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuer or a Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer or such Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor,
as applicable, to the extent of the euro amount, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount
so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not
practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

397


-----

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Senior
Subordinated Notes Trustee under any Senior Subordinated Note, the Issuer and the Senior
Subordinated Notes Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee on a joint or
several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity
provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior
Subordinated Note or the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any
such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer's
and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and
independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior
Subordinated Note or the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof
for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Senior Subordinated Notes
Guarantee or to the Senior Subordinated Notes Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in
a non- euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the
date such non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**ENFORCEABILITY OF JUDGMENTS**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantors are
located outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer or any
Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal,
premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase price with
respect to the Senior Subordinated Notes or the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, may not be
collectable within the United States.

**CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Subordinated
Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantees, the
Issuer and each Senior Subordinated Notes Guarantor will, in the Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture,
appoint an agent for service of process and irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United
States.

**GOVERNING LAW**

The Senior Subordinated Notes Indenture, the Senior Subordinated Notes and the Senior Subordinated
Notes Guarantees, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

The New Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.

**Book-Entry, Delivery and Form**

**General**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to QIBs pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
"144A Global Notes"). Each series of Notes sold outside the United States in offshore transactions
pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A
Global Notes, the "Global Notes"). The Global Notes will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a
common depository and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depository for the
accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes ("Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests") and ownership
of interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests" and, together
with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons who have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons who may hold interests through such
participants. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through,
records maintained in book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The
Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant's account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states
of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such
securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer
or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, owners of interests in
the Global Notes will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of
the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or "holder" of Notes
under the Indentures for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or their or its respective nominee), will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes
under the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and
the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders
of the Notes under the Indentures.

None of the Issuer and no Trustee under the Indentures, Agent nor any of the Issuer's respective agents
will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive registered notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in
registered form (the "Definitive Registered Notes"):

  - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as
depository for the Global Notes and a successor depository is not appointed by the Issuer;

  - if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indentures; or

  - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interests requests such exchange in writing delivered through
Euroclear or Clearstream following an event of default under the Indentures and enforcement
action is being taken in respect thereof under the Indentures.

In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names
and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from
participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in "Transfer Restrictions" unless such legend is not
required by the Indentures or applicable law.

**Redemption of global notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, will distribute the amount received in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders

432


-----

of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by them or it in respect of the
redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of
such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer
understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes
are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants'
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other
basis as they deem fair and appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than
€100,000 principal amount at maturity may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on global notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts then required to be paid under the Notes) will be made by
the Issuer to the Paying Agent. In turn, the Paying Agent will make such payments to Euroclear and
Clearstream, which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective
procedures. We expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern
payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuer, the relevant Trustee and the relevant Agent will treat the
registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear or Clearstream (or its
nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes.
Consequently, none of the Issuer and no Trustee or Agent or any of their respective agents has or will
have any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments
made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

  - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

  - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants.

**Currency and payment for the global notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by owners of book-entry interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear
and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of
any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the Notes,
each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive
Registered Notes in certificated form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their
respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear's and Clearstream's rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder of
Notes requires the physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell
Notes to persons in states that require the physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indentures.

433


-----

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth under "Transfer Restrictions". Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed under "Transfer Restrictions".

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A BookEntry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the
form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with
Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person whom the transferor
reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements
of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer
_Restrictions" and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction._

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a
Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount
of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and exchange" and
"Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes—Transfer and exchange", and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the relevant Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to such Notes. See "Transfer Restrictions".

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in
the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note,
and accordingly will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry
Interest.

**Information concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are
controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither the Issuer nor any of the
Initial Purchasers, any Trustee or any Agent is responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through
electronic book entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide
various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement,
lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as
underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations.
Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or
Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account
holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on
behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge
such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of
securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may
be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will

434


-----

receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream
participants.

**Global clearance and settlement under the book-entry system**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to trading on the Global
Exchange Market and listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin. The Issuer expects that secondary
trading in any Notes will be settled in accordance with rules and operating procedures of Euroclear,
Clearstream and/or Euronext Dublin.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to
facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as
the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and
such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of us and no Trustee or Agent will
have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear, Clearstream or their respective participants
or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their
operations.

**Initial settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value
on the settlement date.

**Secondary market trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those
systems are open for business.

**Certain Tax Considerations**

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes_
_including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale_
_or redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

**Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain US federal income tax considerations related to the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. This discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a US holder (as defined below) except
for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under "—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"), and does not
address the effects of any US federal tax laws other than US federal income tax laws (such as estate
and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-US tax laws. This discussion is based upon the US Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the
"Treasury Regulations"), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on
the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No rulings from
the US Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") have been or are expected to be sought with respect to
the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position
concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any
such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the US federal income tax consequences that may be relevant
to a holder in light of such holder's particular circumstances, including the impact of the unearned
income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial
institutions, US expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities
or currencies, traders in securities, US holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar, taxexempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other
pass through entities and investors in such entities, holders of Existing Notes that are redeemed in the
substantially simultaneous redemption transactions, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, US
holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United
States, persons holding the Notes as part of a "straddle," "hedge," "conversion transaction" or other
integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, and persons subject to special tax
accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into
account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who
purchase the Notes for cash at original issue and at their "issue price" (i.e. the first price at which a
substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally for investment).

For purposes of this discussion, a "US holder" is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for US federal
income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
or any entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes created or organized in or
under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the
income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a
court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a
valid election is in place to treat the trust as a US person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the US tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the Notes, and
partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the US federal income tax
consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the**
**application of the US federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the**
**application of other federal, state, local, non-US or other tax laws.**

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

436


-----

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (as well as any additional amounts paid with respect to
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the
gross income of a US holder as ordinary income at the time that such payments are received or accrued,
in accordance with such US holder's method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes.

A US holder that uses the cash method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes and that
receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the US dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on
the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to US dollars
at such time. A cash method US holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with
respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposition of the euro so received.

A US holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes (or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary
income) the US dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with
respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The US dollar value of such euro denominated accrued
interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the
accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot
rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An accrual basis US holder may elect,
however, to translate such accrued interest income into US dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the
last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years,
at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual
period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a US holder that has
made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments
held by an electing US holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A US holder
that uses the accrual method of accounting for US federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange
gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received. The amount
of exchange gain or loss recognized will equal the difference, if any, between the US dollar value of the
euro payment received (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such interest is received)
with respect to such accrual period and the US dollar value of the interest income that has accrued
during such accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact
converted to US dollars at such time. Any such exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary
income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and
generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount ("OID") for US federal income tax purposes. A
series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series of Notes
exceeds its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined
_de minimis_ amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of
complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event a series of Notes is issued with OID, US holders of such series of Notes generally will be
required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for US federal income tax purposes
on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of
accounting for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, US holders of such series of Notes
generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Note includible in income by a US holder is the sum of the
"daily portions" of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof
in which such US holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any
"accrual period" a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note
may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual
period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on
the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual
period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note's "adjusted issue price" at the beginning of such
accrual period and its "yield to maturity", determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each
accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest
allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period
generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The

437


-----

yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all
principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue
price of the Note. For purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price with respect to
the Senior Subordinated Notes only, the amounts of stated interest and OID are determined by
assuming that the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of
the floating rate applicable to such Notes as of the issue date.

OID, if any, on a Note will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into US
dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under
"—Payments of Stated Interest". A US holder of such Note will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of such Note, the receipt of proceeds that
include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any,
between the US dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on
the date such payment is received, and the US dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on such Note will be viewed first, as payment
of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent
thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of
principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult
their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to any series of Notes as well as the interplay
between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated,
for foreign tax credit purposes, as US source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to
interest income or expense.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Stated interest income (and OID, if any) on a Note generally will constitute foreign source income and
generally will be considered "passive category income" in computing the foreign tax credit allowable to
US holders under US federal income tax laws. Any non-US withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a US
holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu
of such credits) for US federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding
period and at risk rules). There are significant complex limitations on a US holder's ability to claim
foreign tax credits. US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility
of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder
generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon
such disposition (less any amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included in income by the US holder)
and such US holder's adjusted tax basis in the Note.

A US holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such US holder,
increased by any OID previously accrued by such US holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a
Note purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the foreign currency
purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as
traded on an established securities market and the relevant US holder is either a cash basis taxpayer
or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such US holder will
determine the US dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate
of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase.

If a US holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the US dollar value of such
foreign currency translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of disposition. In the case of a Note
that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis US holder and, if it so
elects, an accrual basis US holder, will determine the US dollar value of such foreign currency by
translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The
special election available to accrual basis US holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes
traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by
the US holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis US holder that
does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent

438


-----

that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and
such gain or loss generally will constitute US source ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal
amount of such Note generally will be US source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be
treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any,
between the US dollar value of the US holder's foreign currency purchase price for the Note, translated
at the spot rate of exchange on the date principal is received from the Issuer or the US holder disposes
of the Note, and the US dollar value of the US holder's foreign currency purchase price for the Note,
translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the US holder purchased such Note. In addition,
upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder
may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to
accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under "—
_Payments of Stated Interest" or "—Original Issue Discount", as applicable. However, upon a sale,_
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a US holder will recognize any
foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued stated interest and accrued
OID, if any) only to the extent of total gain or loss realized by such US holder on such disposition.

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note in excess of foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to such disposition
generally will be US source gain or loss and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of noncorporate US holders (including individuals) derived with respect to capital assets held for more than
one year are generally eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to limitations.

US holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of stated interest (and the accrual
of OID, if any) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition (including a retirement
or redemption) of a Note paid to a US holder unless such US holder is an exempt recipient, and, when
required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply to such payments if the
US holder fails to provide a correct taxpayer identification number or a certification that it is not subject
to backup withholding, or otherwise fails to comply with the applicable requirements of the backup
withholding rules.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a US holder's US federal income tax liability
provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations require the reporting to the IRS of certain foreign currency transactions giving rise
to losses in excess of a certain minimum amount, such as the receipt or accrual of interest on or a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received with respect to a foreign currency note. US holders should consult their tax advisors
to determine the tax return disclosure obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes,
including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

US holders who are individuals and who own "specified foreign financial assets" with an aggregate
value in excess of certain minimum thresholds at any time during the tax year generally are required to
file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax returns. If a US
holder does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and
the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all US federal income taxes of such holder
for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such
report is filed. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these
reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions. Under
certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules.

439


-----

US holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as "FATCA") and
subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a "foreign financial institution" may be required to
withhold US tax on certain "foreign passthru payments" to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain US source payments. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months
after applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal
Register generally would be "grandfathered" unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if
the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only
if there is a significant modification of the Notes for US federal income tax purposes after the expiration
of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru
payments on the Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made
on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable
final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed
regulations until final regulations are issued. No such final regulations defining foreign passthru
payments have been issued as of the date hereof. Non-US governments including France have entered
into agreements with the United States (and additional non-US governments are expected to enter into
such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders
should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In
the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there
will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IS A GENERAL SUMMARY. IT DOES NOT COVER ALL TAX MATTERS
THAT MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE TO A PARTICULAR INVESTOR. EACH PROSPECTIVE
INVESTOR IS URGED TO CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR ABOUT THE TAX CONSEQUENCES
TO IT OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF THE INVESTOR'S OWN
CIRCUMSTANCES.

**Certain French tax considerations**

The following is a summary of certain French withholding tax considerations pertaining to the ownership
of the Notes by a holder of the Notes that is (i) not a shareholder of the Issuer and (ii) not related to the
Issuer within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the French Tax Code. Comments which are included
therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at giving a complete analysis of the
tax rules that may affect the investors.

This summary is based on provisions of French tax laws and regulations, as in force and applied by the
French tax authorities at the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of which are subject to change,
possibly with retrospective effect, or to different interpretations. Any investor contemplating to acquire
the Notes should therefore consult its own tax adviser about the tax consequences that may arise for it
as a result of the acquisition, the ownership, the disposal or the redemption of the Notes.

**Withholding Taxes on Payments Made Outside France**

Holders of the Notes who concurrently hold shares of the Issuer may also be impacted by other rules
not described in this section.

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes, as
applicable, will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Tax
Code unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou
_territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code (a "Non-_
Cooperative State") other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article
238-0 A, irrespective of the holder's fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are
made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2°
of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments
(subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by
virtue of Article 125 A III of the French Tax Code. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a
ministerial executive order (arrêté) and amended from time to time. The list of Non-Cooperative States
other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the French Tax Code was last published
on March 4, 2021, and currently includes Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Panama, the Seychelles
and Vanuatu.

440


-----

Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the French Tax Code,
interest and assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer's
taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative
State or paid on an account held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State
(the "Deductibility Exclusion"). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and
assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 _et_
_seq. of the French Tax Code, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under_
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code, at (i) the standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the
first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219-I of the French Tax Code (i.e. 26.5% for fiscal
years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022)
for payments benefiting legal persons which are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for
payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments
made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article
238-0 A of the French Tax Code (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable
provisions of an applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the
French Tax Code nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine
transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the
related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French Tax Code that may be levied as a
result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the Issuer can prove that the
main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and assimilated
revenues in a Non-Cooperative State (the "Exception"). Pursuant to the administrative guidelines
published by the French tax authorities regarding this legislation (BOI-INT-DG-20-50-30 dated
24/02/2021, § 150 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50-20 dated 24/02/2021, § 290 (the "BOFIP")), the Notes will
benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main
purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, and accordingly will be able to automatically benefit from
the Exception (the "Safe Harbor"), if the Notes are:

    - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code for which the publication of a prospectus is mandatory or
pursuant to an equivalent offer in a state other than a Non-Cooperative State (for this
purpose, an "equivalent offering" means any offering requiring the registration or
submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or

    - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral financial
instruments trading facility _provided that such market or facility is not located in a Non-_
Cooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment
services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market
operator, investment services provider, or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State;
and/or

    - admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities
delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French
Monetary and Financial Code, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators
_provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State._

The Notes issued by the Issuer under this Offering Memorandum qualify as debt securities under
French commercial law. Considering that: (i) as of the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will
be admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin in the Republic of Ireland which does not qualify as a NonCooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator which is not located in a NonCooperative State and/or (ii) the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a
central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of
Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative
State, payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe
Harbor and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French
Tax Code, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP. Moreover, under the same
conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated
revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest
and assimilated revenues paid by the Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility
Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2
of the French Tax Code solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a financial institution

441


-----

established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a
Non-Cooperative State.

**Withholding Taxes on Payments Made to Individuals Fiscally Domiciled in France**

Pursuant to Article 125 A I of the French Tax Code, when the paying agent (établissement payeur) is
established in France and subject to certain exceptions, interest and similar income received by
individuals fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France may be subject to a 12.8% withholding
tax, which is deductible from their personal income tax liability in respect of the year in which the
payment has been made. Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and solidarity levy) are also levied by way
of withholding at an aggregate rate of 17.2% on such interest and similar income received by individuals
fiscally domiciled (domiciliés fiscalement) in France, subject to certain exceptions.

**Certain Other Tax Considerations; Payments by a Guarantor**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes it is possible that such payments
may be subject to withholding tax at applicable rates subject to such relief as may be available under
the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or to any other exemption which may apply.
Holders may be eligible to receive a gross up from the payer with respect to the amounts withheld,
subject to certain exceptions, as described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes–Withholding
_Taxes" and "Description of the Senior Subordinated Notes–Withholding Taxes". Holders of Notes_
should consult with their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences if a Guarantor makes any
payments with respect to the Notes.

**Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of**
**the Guarantees and the Security Interests**

Set forth below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the Guarantees and the
security interests in each of the jurisdictions in which security interests in the Collateral are being, or
are expected to be, provided. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy or insolvency or of
a similar nature could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The application of these various laws in
multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction's law should apply and could
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes and the
security interests in the Collateral.

Also set forth below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in the European Union
and France. In the event that the Issuer or any of their subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is
not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

**European Union**

**_EU Insolvency Regulation_**

The Issuer is organized under the laws of Member States of the European Union.

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency
proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2018 published in the Official Gazette of the European Union
on July 6, 2018, (the "EU Insolvency Regulation") was published in the Official Gazette of the
European Union on June 5, 2015.

The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public
collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts
of the Member State in which a debtor's "center of main interests" (as that term is used in Article 3(1)
of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency
proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests
is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even
conflicting views.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings
is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such
decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction.

Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or COMI of a
"debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular
basis and which is ascertainable by third parties". It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable
presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the
absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal
person has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request
for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this
presumption if a debtor's central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its
registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor's actual center of management and supervision
and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU
insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI
in similar terms, the courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining a debtor's
COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts
the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor's
creditors are established. A debtor's COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time
but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence
insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition.

If a debtor's COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark), in which it has
its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency
Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would
be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU
Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU

443


-----

Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark),
although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State.

If a debtor's COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence
"territorial proceedings" (before the opening of the main insolvency proceedings) or "secondary
proceedings" (after the opening of the main insolvency proceedings) against that debtor only if such
debtor has an "establishment" (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member
State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings.
An "establishment" is defined to mean "any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has
carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets".

Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI,
any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an
establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such proceedings are
restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main
proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced,
pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only
be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a)
insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor's COMI is
situated under that Member State's law; or (b) the commencement of territorial insolvency proceedings
is requested by (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an
establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial
proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the
law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency
proceedings are main or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain
exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has
assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6
of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency
proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that
derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance
actions.

The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation
shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable
or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change
from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State
at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include:

- the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the
proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage;

- the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of
the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee;

- the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or
use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled;

- a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long
as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there.

Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court
in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor's COMI
is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another
Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State, subject to Articles
8 and 10) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced
in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a
request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets.

444


-----

However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in
another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member
State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets
or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority
rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened
in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a
qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other
Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is
requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency
practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that
the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors.

Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual
enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between the debtor and
its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor in possession or the insolvency practitioner in the
main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period
not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of
local creditors.

Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency
proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a
request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three
months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency
proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the
process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main
insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the
secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors.

The EU Insolvency Regulation provides:

(a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency
proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the
coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same
debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners
and courts;

(b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the
efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part
of the same group;

(c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and

(d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection
of such insolvency registers.

**_EU Directive on preventive restructuring frameworks_**

The EU directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 on preventive
restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and disqualifications, and on measures to increase the
efficiency of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending
Directive (EU) 2017/1132 (Directive on restructuring and insolvency) (the "EU Restructuring
**Directive") was published on June 26, 2019.**

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and
entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring
frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs
(i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby
affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring,
insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length.

The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of
restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum
standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of
debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to

445


-----

address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented
and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for
a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors
must be introduced by Member States' national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into
separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of
secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be
restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount
of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected
parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may,
under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more
classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the
plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the
protection of each type of creditors' rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption
of the plan. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new
financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted
in the context of the restructuring.

The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States
by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of
communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 17,
2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum 1 year extension of the transposition period
for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.

Although which proceedings will be affected by the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into
French law has not yet been determined, it seems likely that safeguard, accelerated safeguard,
accelerated financial safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings will be substantially amended
to take into consideration the provisions of the Directive.

The major differences between the Directive and current French insolvency law lie in:

- the introduction of classes of creditors into French law based on a commonality of interests as
opposed to the current classification of creditors in accordance with the nature of their
contractual relationship with the debtor and irrespective of their actual chances of repayment,
_i.e., as credit institutions, main suppliers or bondholders; and_

- the possibility to set up shareholders as one specific class when their rights may be impaired,
allowing other classes of creditors to impose a plan on shareholders, which can only occur in
very restrictive circumstances under current French law.

**France**

**_Insolvency_**

We conduct part of our business activity in France and, to the extent that the registered office of the
Issuer is deemed to be located in France, it could be subject to confidential French court-assisted
proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings (which do not fall within
the scope of the EU Insolvency Regulation). In addition, to the extent that their COMI or, in cases where
the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, their main center of interests within the meaning of article
R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France or they have an establishment in
France, they could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e.,
either safeguard proceedings, accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings (sauvegarde, sauvegarde accélérée or sauvegarde financière accélérée), judicial
reorganization proceedings (redressement judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation
judiciaire).

Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or insolvency proceedings with respect to debtors that meet
or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) €20 million in
turnover and 250 employees or (y) €40 million in turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with
respect to which the court's international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency
Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having
its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts.

In addition, the French court that commences insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a
corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having
international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above, and

446


-----

to specific control thresholds); accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the
whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator and creditors' representative
(mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group.

In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of
employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the
Notes and corresponding security interests in the Collateral.

Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial
safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within
the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our group having its COMI in France
would be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency
Regulation and any company of our group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another
EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings
within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation.

The following is a general discussion of preventive and insolvency proceedings governed by French
law for informational purposes only and does not address all the French legal considerations that may
be relevant to holders of the Notes. Such proceedings will likely be amended in the context of the
transposition of the Restructuring Directive into French law with respect to which French statute n°
2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 ("Loi Pacte") grants the French government twenty-four months to enact
appropriate measures through ordinances for the transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive.

**_Temporary measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic_**

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain temporary measures have recently been enacted by the French
Government to adapt French insolvency law to the health crisis (Ordinance No. 2020-1443 dated
November 25, 2020, in force as from November 26, 2020 and Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7,
2020, in force as from December 8, 2020).

In particular, until December 31, 2021, pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November
25, 2020, in force as from November 26, 2020, at the request of the conciliator, the duration of
conciliation proceedings may be extended one or more times, by a reasoned decision of the president
of the court, up to a maximum of ten months (see "—Conciliation Proceedings" below).

In addition, article 124 of Law n°2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, in force as from December 8,
2020, extends until December 31, 2021 the following measures that were initially adopted by Ordinance
n°2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, in force as from May 21, 2020 that were due to expire on December
31, 2020:

- additional specific measures aimed at protecting debtors and an adaptation of the provisions
governing grace periods in the context of conciliation proceedings (see "—Conciliation
_Proceedings" and "—Grace Periods" below);_

- the loosening of the conditions for eligibility to Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings and
Accelerated Financial Safeguard Proceedings (see "—Accelerated Safeguard Proceedings"
below);

- the supervising judge's right, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or the creditors'
representative, to reduce from 30 to 15 days of receipt of the debt settlement proposal the
deadline during which creditors can respond to a debt settlement proposal in the context of a
standard consultation for the approval of a safeguard or reorganization plan (see "—Adoption
_of the Safeguard or Reorganization Plan" below);_

- the possible up to two year extension of the duration of the safeguard or reorganization plan,
as a result of which such a plan can now last up to 12 years (see "—Adoption of the Safeguard
_or Reorganization Plan" below); and_

- the grant of a special privilege for creditors that make new cash contributions to the debtor
during the observation period in order to ensure the continuation of the company's business
and its survival and for those who undertake to make such contribution for the execution of the
safeguard or reorganization plan ordered or modified by the court (the "S/R Lien").

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, these rules may be further adapted and additional measures may be
put in place within the following weeks or months, which may have an impact on French insolvency law.

447


-----

**_Grace periods_**

In addition to insolvency laws discussed below, you could, like any other creditors, be subject to
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (Code civil).

Pursuant to the provisions of this article, French courts may, in any civil or commercial proceedings
involving the debtor, whether initiated by the debtor or the creditor, taking into account the debtor's
financial position and the creditor's needs, defer or otherwise reschedule over a maximum period of two
years the payment dates of payment obligations and decide that any amounts, the payment date of
which is thus deferred or rescheduled, will bear interest at a rate that is lower than the contractual rate
(but not lower than the legal rate, as published semi-annually by the French government) or that
payments made shall first be allocated to repayment of principal. A court order made under Article 13435 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default
interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the
relevant judge.

If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in
the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see "—Court-assisted
_Proceedings" below)._

**_Insolvency test_**

Under French law, a debtor is considered to be insolvent (en état de cessation des paiements) when it
is unable to pay its due debts (passif exigible) with its immediately available assets (actif disponible)
taking into account available credit lines, existing debt rescheduling agreements and moratoria. The
date of insolvency (date état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the
court ruling commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court
sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court ruling.
Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final
court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings.
The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see below).

**_Court-assisted Proceedings_**

A French debtor facing difficulties may in certain conditions request the commencement of courtassisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation), the aim of which is to reach an agreement with
the debtor's main creditors and stakeholders e.g. an agreement to reduce or reschedule its
indebtedness.

_Mandat ad hoc proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself, in its sole discretion. In practice,_
_mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not_
insolvent (see "—Insolvency test" above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save
for the disclosure of the court's decision appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if
any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc), whose
name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The
proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the president
of the court (usually the commercial court) who appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations
with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their
duration. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under
Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see "—Grace periods" above). The agreement reached is
reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it.

_Conciliation proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable_
difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see –"Insolvency test" above) or
has not been insolvent for more than 45 days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the
disclosure of the court decision commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are
carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be
suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may
last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the
conciliator, the court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months).

448


-----

Pursuant to article 1 of Ordinance n°2020-1443 dated November 25, 2020 adopted in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in force as from November 26, 2020 and until December 31, 2021, at the request
of the conciliator, the duration of the conciliation proceedings may be extended, one or more times, by
a reasoned decision of the president of the court up to a maximum of ten months.

The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its
creditors and/or trade partners that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g. providing for the restructuring of
its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely
consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the
agreement nor forced to accept it. _Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending_
proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their
claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so, and
creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (redressement judiciaire or liquidation
_judiciaire) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to article L. 611-_
7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the
judge that commenced them for a grace period (debt rescheduling for a maximum of two years) in
accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see "—Grace periods" above) provided that a
creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, or is suing for payment; the judge will take its
decision after having heard the conciliator and may condition the duration of the measures it orders to
reaching an agreement in the conciliation proceedings.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n° 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance n° 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and
Ordinance n° 2020-1443 of November 25, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 have
modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021:

(a) the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator,
thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of
5 months previously);

(b) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the
conciliator to defer payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the
debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for
the duration of the conciliation proceedings:

## • the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract
for a payment default;

## • the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor's
movable or immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the
distribution of the debtor's assets that would not have already transferred ownership
away from the debtor; or

## • the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor's claim;

(c) the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period
in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see "—France—Grace periods"
above) even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a
creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the
conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation.

Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having
commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement
(whether it is acknowledged or approved as described below) and taking into consideration the
conditions of its performance, impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the
conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put
the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation
agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to
monitor the implementation of the agreement.

The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the
president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement binding
upon them (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors
party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement)

449


-----

and enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings
remain confidential.

Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the
request of the debtor following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee
representatives, as the case may be, must be convened if (i) the debtor is not insolvent or the
conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor's insolvency, (ii) the conciliation
agreement effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern and (iii) the conciliation
agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same
effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition:

- the decision of approval by the relevant Civil or Commercial Court, which should only disclose
the amount of any New Money Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests
granted to secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain
confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed
of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation
agreement at the clerk's office (greffe) of the Court;

- creditors that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or
services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than
shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of
payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (except with respect to
certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs)
(the "New Money Lien"), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial
reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings;

- in the event of subsequent safeguard accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard,
judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the New
Money Lien may not, without their holders' consent, be written off and their payment date may
not be rescheduled to a date later than the date on which the safeguard or reorganization plan
is adopted, not even by the creditors' committees (the powers of the bondholders general
meeting in this respect are the subject of debate);

- when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated
to its statutory auditors; and

- in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation
proceedings, the date of insolvency (see "—Insolvency test" above), and therefore the starting
date of the hardening period (as defined below see "—The hardening period (période suspecte)
_in judicial reorganization and liquidation proceedings"), cannot be set by the court as of a date_
earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in
case of fraud).

Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the court may, at the request of the
debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l'exécution
_de l'accord) during its execution and, while the agreement is in force:_

- interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be
compounded;

- the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings
for a grace period in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code as
explained above; and

- a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee (sûreté
_personnelle) or security interest (sûreté réelle)) with respect to the debtor's obligations may_
benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted
to the debtor in the context of conciliation proceedings.

If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president
of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its
termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation
proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any
individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the
conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard

450


-----

or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the
creditors will recover their claims (decreased by the payments already received) and pre-existing
security interests or guarantees.

Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by
a large majority of creditors which is likely to meet the threshold requirements for creditors' consent in
safeguard, is a mandatory preliminary step of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings, as described below.

At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted
on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or
total sale of the debtor, in particular through a "plan for the disposal of the business" (plan de cession)
which could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or
liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this
context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliator may be directly considered by the court in the context
of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public
prosecutor.

As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an
ongoing contract by reducing the debtors' rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the
designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request
submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a
_mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_
the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is
deemed null and void.

Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement
being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself
entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic
commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced
before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Safeguard_**

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent
(see "—Insolvency test" above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the
hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following
the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur
_judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment_
is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an "observation period" (being the
period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date
on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to
18 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft
safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors. Creditors do not
have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the
court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of
the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor
(mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission
_d'assistance), all under the supervision of the court._

If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de
_cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator,_
the creditors' representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor,
the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings.

In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings
(a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) if the approval of a safeguard
plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard
proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the
debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases:

451


-----

- the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
creditors' representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative except in the case of (i)
(b) above where:

      - the court may not act upon its own initiative, and

      - the court-appointed administrator, the creditors' representative or the public prosecutor
may only act in the event that no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors
committee and, if any, the bondholders general meeting (as described below);

- the court's decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator, the creditors' representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the
workers' representatives (if any).

As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor
becomes immediately due and payable.

Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French
government, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7,
2020, modified safeguard proceedings to provide that:

- as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or
reorganization proceedings a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the "S/R
**Lien"), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and**
December 31, 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed
by financing granted, with the approval of the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire), after
commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation
period.

- The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made
through a share capital increase, by any person:

      - during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor's business and
its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the
insolvency judge, or

      - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as
approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being
specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as
well as the relevant amounts.

- Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and
post-commencement claims except with respect to employees' super-privilege claims,
procedural costs and the New Money Lien in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard
proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings.

- Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors.

During the safeguard proceedings, payment by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the
commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred
for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services
rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is prohibited, subject to very limited exceptions. For example,
the court can authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the
continued operation of the debtor's business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a
fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire).

Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor's liabilities will be settled under the
safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being
approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business.

_Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors whose accounts are not certified by a statutory_
auditor or prepared by a chartered accountant or, if they are, who have 150 employees or less or a
turnover of €20 million or less unless, upon their or the administrator's request and with the consent of
the court, they are subject to the committee-based consultation (see below).

452


-----

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed
creditors' representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the
debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively.

French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and
whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According
to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible,
_provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-_
appointed creditors' representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a
proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such
claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the
maximum is fifteen years).

Pursuant to article 5 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 until
December 31, 2021, the maximum length of a plan can be extended to 12 years, or 17 years for
agricultural businesses.

Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as
the plan is approved are not required to be consulted.

Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than
debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors' representative
keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed
administrator and the controllers.

Pursuant to Article 4 of Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 adopted in the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, in force from May 21, 2021 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, until
December 31, 2021, the abovementioned 30-day delay may be reduced to 15 days, at the request of
the court-appointed administrator or the court-appointed creditors' representative.

Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de
_sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_
that were submitted to them (subject to specific regimes such as the one applicable to claims benefiting
from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural
businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates of more than the
deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no write-off
of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor's individual
acceptance.

Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment
adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of
at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment
date following the initial maturity of the claim if it is later than the first payment date provided for by the
plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received
had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors.

_Committee-based consultation: This applies to large companies whose accounts are certified by a_
statutory auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or established by a chartered-accountant (expert_comptable) and with more than 150 employees or a turnover greater than €20 million or upon the_
debtor's or the administrator's request and with the consent of the court in the case of debtors that do
not meet the aforementioned thresholds.

The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan for consideration by two
creditors' committees which are established by the court-appointed administrator on the basis of the
claims that arose prior to the judgment commencing the proceedings:

- one for credit institutions or assimilated institutions and entities having granted credit or
advances in favor of the debtor (or their successors) (the "credit institutions' committee");
and

- the other one for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of
the claims of all the debtor's suppliers and other suppliers invited to participate in such
committee by the court-appointed administrator (the "major suppliers' committee").

453


-----

If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of _obligations (such as bonds or notes and_
including capital market debt instruments such as the Notes), a single general meeting of all holders of
such debt securities will be established (the "bondholders' general meeting"), in which all such
holders are to take part irrespective of whether or not there are different issuances or of the governing
law(s) of those obligations.

As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited onto the committee or general
meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of
the committee or general meeting.

The proposed plan:

- must "take into account" subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the
commencement of the proceedings;

- may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and

- may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts (subject to the specific regime of
claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps
(debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent).

If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may subscribe to such share capital
increase by way of a set-off against their claims against the debtor (as reduced according to the
provisions of the plan, where applicable).

Creditors that are members of the credit institutions' committee or of the major suppliers committee may
also prepare alternative safeguard plans in accordance with the above principles that will also be put to
the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders' meeting, it being specified that approval of
any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the
bondholders' general meeting and gives rise to a report by the court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire). Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan.

The committees must approve or reject the safeguard plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The
period may be extended or shortened but may never be shorter than 15 days. The plan must be
approved by a majority vote of each committee (two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors
casting a vote).

Each member of a creditors committee or of the bondholders' general meeting must, if applicable, inform
the court-appointed administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to (i) the exercise of its
vote or (ii) the full or total payment of its claim by a third party as well as of any subordination agreement.
The court-appointed administrator shall then submit to such person a proposal for the computation of
its voting rights in the creditors committee/bondholders' general meeting. In the event of disagreement,
the matter may be ruled upon by the president of the Commercial Court in summary proceedings at the
request of the creditor or of the court-appointed administrator.

The amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights.
In addition, creditors whose repayment schedule is not modified by the plan, or for which the plan
provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their
claims are admitted, do not need to be consulted on the plan nor take part in the vote.

Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors' committees, the plan will be submitted for
approval to the bondholders' general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval
by the creditors' committees and the bondholders' general meeting, and determination of the
rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders in
accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above, the plan has to be approved
(arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are "sufficiently protected"
and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Once so approved by the
relevant court, the safeguard plan will be binding on all the members of the committees and all
bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan).

Creditors that are not members of the committees are consulted collectively or individually in
accordance with the standard consultation process (see above).

If the debtor's proposed plan is not approved by both committees and the bondholders' general meeting
within the first six months of the observation period (either because they do not vote on the plan or
because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the court
454


-----

appointed administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for
the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension,
the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation
period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation
process described above.

If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the bylaws, the court may decide that
the shareholders' general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of
securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting
is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the
meeting, _provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the_
meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to
be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent.

If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees and, if applicable, the
bondholders' general meeting, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the
_mandataire judiciaire or the State prosecutor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into_
judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and
if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead to the debtor shortly becoming insolvent.

_Specific case- Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social_
security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under
conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private
economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into
subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors
examine possible write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des
_Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards_
indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Accelerated Safeguard and Accelerated Financial Safeguard_**

A debtor that is engaged in conciliation proceedings may request the commencement of accelerated
safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée).

The accelerated safeguard proceedings and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been
designed to "fast-track" difficulties faced by large companies, i.e. those:

- that publish consolidated accounts in accordance with Article L. 233-16 of the French
Commercial Code; or

- whose accounts are certified by a statutory auditor or established by a certified public
accountant and who have (i) more than 20 employees or (ii) a turnover greater than €3 million
(excluding VAT) or (iii) whose total balance sheet exceeds €1.5 million.

However, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020
provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22,
2020 and December 31, 2021.

If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors' committees (see above) to be
constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision.

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings,
the debtor must fulfil the following conditions:

- the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for
commencement of conciliation proceedings;

- the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the
commencement of the proceedings;

- as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not
in a position to overcome; and

455


-----

- the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business
as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings
to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions' committee only for
financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders' general meeting, if any, within
a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard
proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings.

While accelerated safeguard proceedings apply to all creditors (except employees), accelerated
financial safeguard proceedings apply only to "financial creditors" (i.e., creditors that belong to the credit
institutions committee and bondholders' general meeting), the payment of whose debt is suspended
until adoption of a plan through accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The debtor will be
prohibited from paying, to any creditor to whom the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings (as the case may be) apply, any amounts (including interest) in respect of debts
incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the
proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in
consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor (post-commencement non-privileged
debts). Such amounts may be paid only after the judgment of the court approving the safeguard plan
and in accordance with its terms. Creditors other than financial creditors (such as public creditors, the
tax or social security administration and suppliers) are not directly impacted by accelerated financial
safeguard proceedings. Their debts will continue to be due and payable in the ordinary course of
business according to their contractual or legal terms.

The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated
safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (for example, creditors will be consulted by
way of a committee-based consultation on, as the case may be, a draft accelerated safeguard plan
(projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée) or a draft accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan
_de sauvegarde financière accélérée) and creditors that are members of the credit institutions' committee_
or the major suppliers' committee, but not bondholders, may also prepare alternative draft plans as
described above (see "—Committee-based consultation")), to the extent compatible with the
accelerated timing, since the maximum duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months
and the maximum duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is two months (provided the
court has decided to extend the initial one-month period). In particular, the creditors' committees and
the bondholders' general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum
period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or
within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and to the recovery of assets by their owners
do not apply in accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.

The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard
proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and
may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the
debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent). No debt rescheduling or
cancellation may be imposed, without their consent, on creditors that do not belong to one of the
committees or are not bondholders.

If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the
court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors
outside of the committee process. Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law n° 2020-1525
dated December 7, 2020 provide that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and
December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the
applicable deadline the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the public
prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case
may be) be opened.

The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall
be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings
or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors
otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below).

456


-----

**_Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Liquidation Proceedings_**

Judicial reorganization (redressement judiciaire) or liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) proceedings may
be initiated against or by a debtor only if it is insolvent and, in the case of liquidation proceedings only,
if the debtor's recovery is manifestly impossible. The debtor is required to petition for judicial
reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for
conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case
may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed
to civil liability.

Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court,
after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate,
it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The
same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and
the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at
any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator,
the creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own
initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation
proceedings if it appears that the debtor's recovery is manifestly impossible. The court's decision is only
taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors' representative, the
controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers' representatives (if any).

The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the
preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order.

As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid
amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable.

In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually
appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which
may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping
the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan), or
the sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist
the debtor in making management decisions (mission d'assistance) or may be empowered by the court
to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d'administration). Judicial
reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see
above), subject to certain specificities.

In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially the powers of the court adopting the
judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals
made to them, are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at
the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors' representative (mandataire
_judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation_
_partielle de l'activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the_
end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court.

In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings
to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see "France - Court-administered
_Proceedings – Safeguard"). In judicial reorganization proceedings, in case a shareholders' meeting_
needs to vote to bring the shareholders' equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital
as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint a trustee
(mandataire de justice) to convene a shareholders' meeting and to vote on behalf of the shareholders
that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification
of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan.

If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly not likely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if
no reorganization plan is proposed, the court, upon the request of the court-appointed administrator,
can order the total or partial transfer of the business in accordance with the process for a sale of the
business described below.

In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls
(within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150
employees, (ii) the disappearance of the company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or
regional economy and to local employment and (iii) the modification of the company's share capital

457


-----

appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the
continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed
administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of
the business and (y) if at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the
proceedings, _provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the_
company's share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such
modification, the insolvency court may either:

- appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the
share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount
provided for in the reorganization plan; or

- order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale
of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital
modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with
a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders)
or a blocking minority in the company's shareholder meetings, any consent clause being
deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and
request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees.

In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the
parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings.

In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new
shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the
duration of the reorganization plan.

Third parties may make bids to purchase all or part of the debtor's business as a going concern, in the
framework of a "sale plan" (plan de cession) (see below).

If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which
is generally the former creditors' representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period
in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified
judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and
perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the
proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors' priority order of
payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of
the debtor are no longer in charge of its management.

Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes:

- a sale of the business (cession d'entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator
(administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary
period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable
once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a
"sale plan" (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being
entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor's business; or

- a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to:

      - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères (or _adjudication amiable for real estate_
assets only));

      - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous
purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the insolvency judge
being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or

      - request, under the supervision of the insolvency judge, all potential interested
purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive
process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the
proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés).
However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal
authors and case-law in this respect has varied.

458


-----

If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it
deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its
consent.

The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient
funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes
impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d'actif).

The court may also terminate the proceedings:

- when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to
the difficulty of selling the assets;

- in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a
_mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from_
these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.

**_The "hardening period" (période suspecte) in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation_**
**_proceedings_**

The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) of a debtor is deemed to be the date of the court
order commencing the proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be no earlier than
18 months before the date of such court order. Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date
may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement
(homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important
because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the
insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation
proceedings affecting it.

Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the
court.

- Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the
hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to
the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a
nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed
the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment,
payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary
course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that
has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with
article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred, provisional
attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure
predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets
or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt
simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets
or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment,
and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d'insaisissabilité)
pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code.

- Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due,
transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers
_détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in_
each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor
was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no
consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration
_d'insaisissabilité) pursuant to article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable_
when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings.

**_Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Accelerated Financial Safeguard,_**
**_Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings_**

Contractual provisions pursuant to which the commencement of the proceedings triggers the
acceleration of the debt (except with respect to judicial liquidation proceedings in which the court does
not order the continued operation of the business) or the termination or cancellation of an ongoing

459


-----

contract are not enforceable against the debtor. Nor are "contractual provisions modifying the conditions
of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor
solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings" (in accordance with a decision of the
French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended
to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the
court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours)
which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the court-appointed
administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even
though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its postcommencement contractual obligations (and _provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or_
judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on
delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the
maturity of all of a debtor's obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business
with a view to the adoption of a "sale plan" (plan de cession) as described above; in such case, the
acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the "sale plan"
(plan de cession), as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business
ends.

As from the court decision commencing the proceedings:

- accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of
contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued
interest can no longer be compounded);

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related
(connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to
recover assets required by the continued operation of the business);

- the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the
proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the
observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor;

- debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the
purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services
rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall
due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien),
provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one,
the _mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan_
commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period;

- creditors (only financial creditors in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings)
may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor
of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person and the proceedings are safeguard,
accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard) with respect to any claim arising prior
to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is:

      - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however,
the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof
of claim, as described below);

      - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; or

      - to enforce the creditor's rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial
liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial
foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable - is located in another Member
State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon
would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in
accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation;

- in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms
of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract
(contrat en cours), will be required.

460


-----

A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan
("plan de sauvegarde") adopted by the Court but not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan
("plan de redressement").

In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within
the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue
to be payable in the ordinary course of business.

As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the
commencement of proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors' representative
within two months of the publication of the court decision in an official gazette (Bulletin Officiel des
_annonces civiles et commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled outside_
metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts,
with respect to which the two- or four-month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity
date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited
exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees
are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the
creditors' representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has
informed the creditors' representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is
deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors' representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors
are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules
on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines
described above.

In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws
a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by
its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular
process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the
amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four
months' time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs
of claim within the aforementioned deadlines.

If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan
or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the
plan.

If the court adopts a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial
liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment
of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation
of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor's debts in
accordance with their ranking.

French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including
employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit
from a New Money Lien or a S/R Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the
French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain
pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to postcommencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it
does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related
to such asset.

**_Creditors' Liability_**

Pursuant to Article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (as interpreted by case law), where
safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors
may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of facilities granted to the debtor, if the granting
of such facilities was wrongful and if the relevant creditor (i) committed a fraud, or (ii) interfered with the
management of the debtor or (iii) obtained security or guarantees which are disproportionate to such
facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor
is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.

461


-----

**_Limitations on Guarantees_**

The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to:

- certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited
financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code
or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French
Commercial Code; and

- French corporate benefit rules.

Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of
another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition.

Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from
the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare
any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee,
require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were
not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts
guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case
law provides no clear guidance.

Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder
will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the
extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously
directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany
loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such
French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its
Notes Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce _pro tanto the_
outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under
the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor's
obligation under the Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect
to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantees.

In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that
is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on
an arm's-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable
arm's-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.

Rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the
Collateral.

Under French law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority
retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security.
The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these
liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that no Trustee or Security Agent shall have any obligation to
take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French
subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist
of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the relevant
securities are registered. The securities account pledges will be validly established after execution of a
statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte titres financiers) by each security provider
in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will have to be registered in the relevant
shareholder's account (compte d'actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of
each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not
publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be
given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered.

Limitations on enforcement of security interests and cash amount ("soulte")

Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is
due and unpaid to it. Pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account
or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the
option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction
(the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure

462


-----

(attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the
secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged
securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial
foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the
value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial
attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value
of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the
pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so
determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds
ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral.

If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to
the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the
remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect.

An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance
with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible
that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the
latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an
investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the
methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.

In addition, in view of the area of activity of the Group or certain members of the Group, it should be
noted that foreign investments in companies or businesses which operate in certain sectors (notably
where their activities relate to equipment, products or services which are critical to the interests of
France in terms of public order, public safety or national security, in particular in the areas of energy
and water supply, public health, public transport and electronic communication) may require the prior
authorization of the French authorities. This requirement may interfere with the enforcement of the
Collateral consisting of shares or a business.

Where any of the above sectors are involved, the following shall constitute foreign investments which
are subject to the prior authorization procedure:

- A transaction as a result of which a non-EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning
of Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), (ii) acquires all or part of a business
(branche d'activité) or (iii) crosses the threshold of 33.33 percent of the share capital, in each
case of a company whose registered office is located in France.

- A transaction as a result of which an EU investor (i) acquires the control (within the meaning of
Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) or (ii) acquires all or part of a business, in
either case of a company whose registered office is located in France.

- A transaction as a result of which a French investor under non-French control acquires all or
part of a business of a company whose registered office is located in France.

When a foreign investment is subject to the authorization of the French authorities as above, the
transaction cannot be completed prior to authorization. The foreign investor must submit a formal
application for prior authorization to the French authorities which must render a decision within two
months of receipt of the application (failing which authorization shall be deemed to have been granted).

In addition to these limitations, specific insolvency-related limitations may prevent the enforcement of
security interests in the context of court-assisted or court-administered proceedings.

Security Agent

Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code allow the creation of security interests and personal
guarantees for the direct benefit of a security agent, which will hold such rights separately from its own
estate. As a result, the rights of secured creditors under security interests and personal guarantees will
be ring fenced if the security agent is the subject of insolvency proceedings (except in cases of fraud or
in cases of the exercise of a right of pursuit (droit de suite) of a creditor). The security agent will remain
liable for gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties. The security agent can
take all legal actions to protect the secured creditor's interests and file a receivable on behalf of one or
several creditors in a debtor's insolvency proceeding. The security agent must be appointed pursuant
to a written agreement specifying its quality, its duties, the duration of its duties and its powers.

Parallel Debt - Trust

The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not be parties to the Security
Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, there
will be provided for the creation of "parallel debt" obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the "Parallel
**Debt") mirroring the obligations of the Issuer (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes**
under or in connection with the Indentures (the "Principal Obligations").

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal
Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding
Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding
Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim
equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will
directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the
other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take
enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if
they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral).

There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt
mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 _Belvédère) relating to a bond_
documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of
certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting
from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal
holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy
_(ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not_
exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although
this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French
courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a
structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal
issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally
uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this
matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as
a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a
Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of
unenforceability under French law.

To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as
Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties,
holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of
the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the
possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt.

Each Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indentures that become particularly
important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best
interests of the holders of the Notes.

The concept of "trust" has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com.
September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by
the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings
commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has
not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition,
so that the concept of "trust" has not been generally recognized under French law.

The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of inter alia the relevant Trustee. To the extent that
the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the relevant Trustee are successfully
challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any
proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the
Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Trustee.

Fraudulent conveyance

French law contains specific, "action paulienne" provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in
and outside insolvency proceedings. The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease

464


-----

in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a debtor (including, without limitation, an agreement
pursuant to which such debtor guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees
to provide or provides security for any of such debtor's or a third party's obligations, enters into additional
agreements benefiting from existing security or any other legal act having similar effect) can be
challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor by the creditors' representative
(mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or reorganization plan (commissaire à
_l'exécution du plan) insolvency proceedings of the relevant debtor, or by any of the creditors of the_
relevant debtor outside the insolvency proceedings or any creditor who was prejudiced in its means of
recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings. Any such legal act may be
declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the debtor performed such act without an obligation
to do so; (ii) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor's insolvency proceedings) any creditor
was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the legal act
was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known
that one or more of such debtor's creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of
recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge
of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security
interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that
did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the
security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Notes Guarantee could be declared
unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim
in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not
enjoy the benefit of the Notes, the Notes Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral and the
value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes, the security
interests in the Collateral or the Notes Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders
of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders
of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the
Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance.

**_Recognition of intercreditor arrangements by French courts_**

There is no law or published decision of the French courts of appeal or of the French Supreme Court
(Cour de cassation) on the validity or enforceability of the obligations of an agreement such as the New
Intercreditor Agreement, except for Articles L. 626-30-2 and L. 631-19 of the French Commercial Code
pursuant to which, in the context of safeguard or judicial reorganization proceedings, the safeguard or
reorganization plan which is put to the vote of the creditors' committees takes into consideration (prend
_en compte) the provisions of subordination agreements between creditors which were entered into prior_
to the commencement of the safeguard, or judicial reorganization, proceedings. As a consequence,
except to the extent referred to above (which, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, has received
no judicial interpretation), we cannot rule out that a French court would not give effect to certain
provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Recognition of validity of second or lower ranking financial securities account pledges by_**
**_French courts_**

The New Intercreditor Agreement provides for a mechanism allowing the implementation of second or
lower ranking pledges over financial securities accounts.

To our knowledge, French courts have never expressly recognized the concept of second (or lower)
ranking pledges in respect of a financial securities account and, if article 2340 of the French Civil Code
does recognize the possibility to create multiple pledges in respect of the same tangible asset, this
article is not expressly stated to apply to pledges over financial securities accounts. In addition, a pledge
over securities accounts is deemed, under French law, to remove the securities account from the
possession of the grantor, thereby preventing such grantor from granting a second or lower ranking
pledge thereon. The second or lower ranking pledge over the shares of such a company will therefore
provide that the possession of the securities account is transferred to the custody of an agreed third
party as "tiers convenu" (entiercement), that the first ranking and second or lower ranking secured
parties have consented to the creation of second or lower ranking pledge and that the first ranking
secured parties have accepted their appointment as tiers convenu and hold the pledged securities as
custodian for the benefit of both the first ranking and the second or lower ranking secured parties. This
structure has not been tested before the French courts and no assurance can be given that such second
or lower ranking pledges would be upheld if tested. Therefore, there is a risk that the second or lower
ranking pledge over the securities account in which the shares of such company are respectively
registered may be held void or unenforceable by a French court, which in turn could materially adversely

465


-----

affect the recovery under the Notes or Notes Guarantees (as applicable) following an enforcement
event.

**_Assumptions as to the enforceability of second ranking bank accounts pledges over the bank_**
**_accounts_**

The pledges over the bank accounts are governed by French law. In France, no lien searches are
available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over bank accounts. As a
result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the relevant bank accounts of a
company.

Although French law does not expressly prohibit the grantor of a pledge over a bank account from
granting a second ranking pledge over the same bank account, this structure has not been tested before
the French courts and no assurances can be given that such second ranking pledges would be upheld
if tested.

**Luxembourg**

**_Insolvency_**

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more
limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws or the laws of other jurisdictions with which
you may be familiar.

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Luxembourg Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open “main
insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) with respect to the Luxembourg
Guarantor, as an entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale)
and centre of main interests ("COMI"), as used in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article
3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI
in the jurisdiction in which it has its registered office if the registered office has not moved to another
member state within 3 months prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. As a
result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Luxembourg Guarantor is in the Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings would be opened by a
Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law.

However, the determination of where the Luxembourg Guarantor has its COMI is a question of fact,
which may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the
COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its
interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by third parties.

In that respect, the courts have to take a number of factors into consideration. The place where board
meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the
location where the large majority of the company's creditors are established may all be relevant factors
in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company's
COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg.

Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as "insolvency
proceedings") may be opened against (i) if the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, entities which have
their COMI or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the case of an establishment, in respect of secondary
proceedings only and assuming that the COMI is located in a member state other than Denmark and
Luxembourg) or (ii) in all other cases (except specific sector-related proceedings, such as in respect of
credit institutions and insurers), entities which have their central administration in Luxembourg:

  - bankruptcy proceedings ("faillite"), the opening of which may be requested by the company or
by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may
open bankruptcy proceedings if the relevant company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments
("cessation des paiements") and (ii) has lost its creditworthiness ("ébranlement de crédit"). If a
Luxembourg court finds that both of these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy
proceedings ex officio. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures
of enforcement against the company (except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for
enforcement by secured creditors), and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance
with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a

466


-----

Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due
with normal means of payment) must within a month of them having become aware of the
company's cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy ("faillite") with the court clerk of
the district court applicable to the company's registered office. If the managers or directors fail
to comply with such obligation, they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any thirdparties for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy ("banqueroute
_simple") in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce ("Code de_
_commerce");_

  - controlled management proceedings ("gestion contrôlée"), the opening of which may only be
requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a Luxembourg court may
order provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured
creditors subject to certain limited exceptions; and

  - composition with creditors proceedings ("concordat préventif de faillite"), the opening of which
may be requested only by the company (subject to the prior consent of creditors holding at least
75% of the claims outstanding against such company) and not by its creditors themselves. The
Luxembourg court's decision to admit a company to the composition with creditors proceedings
triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors (subject to certain limited
exceptions).

In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a
decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a reprieve from payments ("sursis de paiement") or to put the
Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation ("liquidation judiciaire"). Judicial liquidation proceedings
may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating
criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce or of the
Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will
generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the
company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation
(including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under
Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others:

  - remuneration owed to employees;

  - social security contributions;

  - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg tax administration; and

  - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the tax administration.

Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution
to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is
realized).

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended,
save as provided for in the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law. Other than as described below, the
ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular, in
the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors
are frozen until a final decision has been taken by a Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled
management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization judgment given by the court. A
reorganization judgment requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors, representing via
their claims which have not been challenged more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company's
liabilities, and the court's approval in order to take effect.

Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the
occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Save with respect to financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg
Financial Collateral Law, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or
payments made by a Luxembourg company during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is a
maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific
situations a Luxembourg court may set the start of the hardening period at an earlier date. In particular:

467


-----

  - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, some specific transactions
(such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for prior existing debts; the payment of
debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment,
sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means
other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with
substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (or the ten
preceding days) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency
receiver;

  - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured
debts as well as other transactions entered into for consideration during the hardening period
are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver
if they were entered into with the knowledge of the bankrupt party's cessation of payments;

  - pursuant to article 447 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, the bankruptcy receiver may
challenge and initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted
either ten days prior to or after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have
elapsed between the granting of the mortgage or privilege and its registration; and

  - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the
Luxembourg Civil Code, (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the
creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the
granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time
limit.

In principle, a bankruptcy judgment rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic
termination of contracts, except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of
the company or its solvency were crucial (such as employment agreements and powers of attorney).

Such contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy judgment. However, the insolvency receiver may
choose to terminate certain contracts in order to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the
company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue
_vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy judgment provides for a period of time during which_
creditors must file their claims with the clerk's office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in
commercial matters.

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg
company's business and assets and the Luxembourg company's respective obligations with respect to
the Notes.

In addition, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition
with creditors proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights in rem
over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable will not be
affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the application of rules
relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors
(subject to the application of article 24 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law, as described below
and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation).

The Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides for favorable rules in respect of security interests
over claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial
instruments).

Article 20 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law collateral
arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial
instruments, as well as all enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this
law, are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period ("période suspecte"),
against third-parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons irrespective of any
bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation of composition with creditors, whether national or foreign, save
in the case of fraud.

Article 24 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over
claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg security grantor will be valid and enforceable
as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such
foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interests falling within the

468


-----

scope of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg hardening period
rules are disapplied (save for in the case of fraud).

Article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that where a financial collateral
arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force
of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable
against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the
collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that
such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

**_Security Interest Considerations_**

The granting of security interests over movable or immovable, tangible or intangible, assets may be
subject to validity and/or enforceability conditions. The breach of any of such conditions may render
such security interests invalid or unenforceable. Subject to the below, the enforcement of security
interests may be subject to formalities (including judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be timeconsuming in the event that the enforcement takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal
dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest upon evidence that the creditor
has a final and undisputed claim triggering the enforcement of the security interest. The enforcement of
security interests may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and must not
breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions.

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei
_sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or the subject matter of the security interest are_
situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets.

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of
security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered
shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables governed
by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in
Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such
assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance
with Luxembourg law.

The Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of
security interests over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in
Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain
registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A pledge over shares will be perfected once (i)
acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the pledged shares and (ii) registered
in the relevant register held by the company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge
will require additional registration in the relevant register of such company. A pledge or an assignment
for security purposes granted over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the
receivables and third parties from the moment when the relevant pledge or the assignment agreement
is entered into. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or the assignment or if it did
not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge or the assignment, payments to the pledgor or assignor
will constitute a valid discharge. In the case of a Luxembourg law receivables pledge or assignment for
security purposes, where one or more debtors under the underlying receivables are domiciled in a
country other than Luxembourg, the perfection requirements of the respective laws of the domiciles of
such debtors would also need to be complied with. A bank account pledge must be notified to and
accepted by the account bank. If the account bank has any pre-existing security interests and/or other
rights (including any right of set-off) in respect of the relevant account, the acceptance of the account
bank of the pledge and waiver of its higher ranking rights is required. If (future) bank accounts (opened
with the same account bank) are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional
notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and
acceptances occur, the pledges are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks
or other third parties.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law sets out enforcement remedies available in
relation to pledges upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to:

469


-----

  - direct appropriation of the pledged assets (by the pledgee or a designated third party) at (i) a
value determined (before or after the enforcement) in accordance with a valuation method
agreed upon by the parties or (ii) in the case of financial instruments which are listed on a stock
market or another qualifying regulated market, their listing price;

  - sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms (conditions
_commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public_
auction;

  - attribution in court of the pledged assets in discharge of the secured obligations following a
valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or

  - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

The timing of the enforcement will depend on the practical steps needed to enforce the security (e.g.
the time of the negotiations in the case of a private sale). No legal proceedings are required in
Luxembourg for most enforcement methods.

**_Registration in Luxembourg_**

The registration of the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees and any other Finance Documents (and
any document in connection therewith) with the Administration de l'Enregistrement et des Domaines in
Luxembourg may be required if such documents are either (i) attached as an annex to an act (annexés
_à un acte) that itself is subject to mandatory registration or (ii) deposited in the minutes of a notary_
(déposés au rang des minutes d'un notaire). In such cases, as well as in the case of a voluntary
registration, the documents will be subject to registration duties payable by the party registering, or
being ordered to register, the documents. If such registration is required, such registration duties would
be either _ad valorem (such as for instance a registration duty of 0.24% calculated on the amounts_
mentioned in the document so registered) or fixed (such as for instance a registration duty of €12 for a
pledge).

The Luxembourg courts or the official Luxembourg authority may require that the Notes, the Indenture,
the Guarantees and/or any other Finance Documents (and/or any document in connection therewith)
and/or any judgment obtained in a foreign court be translated into French or German.

**Plan of Distribution**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement to be dated    , 2021, the
Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase
the Notes from the Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the prices indicated on the cover page
hereof. After the initial offering of the Notes, the offering prices and other selling terms of the Notes may
from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Sales of the Notes by the Initial
Purchasers in the United States may be made through affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
qualified broker-dealers under applicable law. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw,
cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the
offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Issuer and the Notes Guarantors will indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.
The Issuer and the Notes Guarantors have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer,
sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any
securities of, or guaranteed by, the Issuer that are substantially similar to the Notes during the period
from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 90 days after the date
of the Purchase Agreement, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the Initial
Purchasers.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act and
may not be offered or sold within the United States except to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A and outside
the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph
have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described
under "Transfer Restrictions".

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area ("EEA"). For the purposes of this provision the expression "retail investor"
means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
"MiFID II"); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97/, (the "Insurance Distribution
**Directive") where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point**
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one
(or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ("EUWA"); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(as amended, the "FSMA") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has:

  - only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the

471


-----

meaning of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of
any Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer or
the Notes Guarantors; and

  - complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by them in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold in France (other than to qualified investors
(investisseurs qualifiés) as defined in, and in accordance with, Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation
and Article L.411-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier), and neither this Offering Memorandum
nor any offering or marketing materials relating to the Notes may be made available or distributed in
any way in France except to qualified investors.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, France and the United
Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit an offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes
in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or
from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any
such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be
unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform
themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering
Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See "Important Information" and "Notice to Investors".

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We intend to list the
Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit them for trading on the Global Exchange
Market thereof; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such
listing will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and
any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial
Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits
imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any
market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell
any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date
specified on the Issue Date, which will be      business days (as such term is used for purposes of
Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is
referred to as "T+      "). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market
generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering
Memorandum or the next succeeding       business days will be required to specify an alternative
settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes
who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage
in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the
Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging,
fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering,
creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover
the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in
market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may
stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise
prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these
activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets
for, the Notes.

These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher
than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or
after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if

472


-----

commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these
activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the
Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in
the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, principal investment, hedging, real estate assets valuation, financing and
brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided,
and may in the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and
financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Note Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and
affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In
addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the
accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or
instruments of the Issuer or its respective affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates
have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates
would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered
hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered
hereby. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment
recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions
in such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes. Affiliates of certain of the Initial Purchasers are among the mandated lead
arrangers and/or lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.

Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are
broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. To the extent
that any Initial Purchaser intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so
through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers as permitted by FINRA regulations.

473


-----

**Transfer Restrictions**

You are advised to consult legal counsel prior to making any offer, resale, pledge or other
transfer of any of the Notes offered hereby.

The Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities
Act, or any state securities laws, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant
to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities
Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the Notes offered hereby are being offered and
sold only to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A) ("QIBs") in reliance on Rule 144A
under the Securities Act and in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on
Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. Accordingly, we are offering and selling the Notes to the Initial Purchasers for
re-offer and resale only:

      - in the United States to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A; and

      - outside the United States in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S.

We use the terms "offshore transaction" and "United States" with the meanings given to them
in Regulation S.

Each purchaser of Notes, by its acceptance thereof, will be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented to and agreed with us and the Initial Purchasers as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes and the Guarantees have not been and will
not be registered under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws and that the
Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring registration under the Securities
Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act, and, unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in
compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable
securities laws, pursuant to an exemption therefrom or in any transaction not subject thereto
and in each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraphs (7) and
(8) below.

(2) You are not our "affiliate" (as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or acting on our
behalf and that either:

(a) you are a QIB (within the meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act) and are
aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A under
the Securities Act, and such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account
of another QIB; or

(b) purchasing the Notes in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S under
the Securities Act.

(3) You represent that you are not a "retail investor" in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For
the purposes of this paragraph, the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or
more) of the following:

(i) a "retail client" as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II.

(4) You represent that you are not a "retail investor" in the United Kingdom ("UK"). For the purposes
of this paragraph, the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one (or more) of the
following:

(i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018
("EUWA"); or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the "FSMA") and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify

474


-----

as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

(5) You understand and acknowledge that:

(i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any "retail investor" (as
defined in paragraph 3 above) in the EEA or any "retail investor" (as defined in
paragraph 4 above) in the UK; and

(ii) consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended the "EU PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation; and

(iii) consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs
Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful
under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

(6) You acknowledge that none of the Issuer, the Guarantors, or the Initial Purchasers, nor any
person representing any of them, has made any representation to you with respect to the Issuer,
the Guarantors or their subsidiaries or the offer or sale of any of the Notes, other than the
information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering Memorandum has been
delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision with
respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that neither the Initial Purchasers nor any person
representing the Initial Purchasers make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or
completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and other
information concerning us and the Notes as you have deemed necessary in connection with
your decision to purchase any of the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and
request information from, us and the Initial Purchasers.

(7) You are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for
which you are acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view
to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any state securities laws, subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of your
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within your or their
control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A,
Regulation S or any other exemption from registration available under the Securities Act.

(8) You agree on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account or accounts for which you
are purchasing Rule 144A Notes, and each subsequent holder of Rule 144A Notes by its
acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such Rule 144A
Notes only (i) to us, (ii) pursuant to a registration statement that has been declared effective

**Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities**

**France**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of France with its registered offices or
principal places of business in France (the "French Entities"). The directors, officers and other
executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the "French
**Individuals"). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are**
located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of
process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated
upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States.
However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons
or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with.

The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law
claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals.

The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters.
Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or
enforceable in France.

A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur)
in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such
matter.

Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte)
proceedings if such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is
satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case
law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment):

- such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the
dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international
forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not
have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter;

- such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both
pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and

- such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law.

In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions
(i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S.
judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective
in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the
U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment.

If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the
_res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared_
enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal.

In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected
under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law
No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to
the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or
technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in
France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to
the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague
Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France
or from French persons.

Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files
and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining

480


-----

information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action
in a discovery context.

Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law
designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern
their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French
international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by
French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state
securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought.

Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual)
can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations
contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French
Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign
claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the
French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has
interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not
be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according
to case law, the French courts' jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an
action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute
and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to
benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct
by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.

It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the
Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the
privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not
be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of
Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be
invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant's nationality, to sue before French
courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU.

The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting
one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to
choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any
relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court
or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

**Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Guarantor is organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Most of
the Luxembourg Guarantor's assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore none of the
Luxembourg Guarantor's directors resides in the United States.

As a result, investors may find it difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon the
Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained
against the Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. Likewise, it may
also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us or these persons
in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil
liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to
bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S.
federal or state securities laws against the Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons. It may be possible
for investors to effect service of process within Luxembourg upon the Luxembourg Guarantor provided
that the relevant provisions of The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial
Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 are complied with.

As there is currently no treaty in force governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of
judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States and the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment
rendered by a U.S. court.

A valid final, non-appealable and conclusive judgment against an issuer incorporated in Luxembourg
with respect to the notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States remains

481


-----

in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with
respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction
of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set out in Article
678 et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure Civile) and
Luxembourg case-law, being:

  - the judgment of the U.S. court is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States;

  - the assumption of jurisdiction (compétence) of the U.S. court is founded according to
Luxembourg private international law rules;

  - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural rules and has applied to the
dispute the substantive law which would have been applied by Luxembourg courts;

  - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the
judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to
appear, and if the counterparty appeared, to present a defense; and

  - the judgment of the U.S. does not contravene Luxembourg public policy and has not been
obtained fraudulently

If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules,
Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not
made _bona fide and/or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved and/or (iii) if pleaded and_
proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg
public policy rules.

In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg
courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an _exequatur_ may be
refused in respect of punitive damages.

In practice, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no
clear statutory prohibition of such review.

Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary
obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have
power to give a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However,
enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for
such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into Euro.

Period from August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021

**Statutory auditors’ review report on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements**

To the President,

In our capacity as statutory auditors of Afflelou and in accordance with your request, we have performed
a review of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements of Afflelou, the accompanying
"Financial Information", for the period from August 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021.

Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Financial Information of this period has
been prepared and reviewed under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures
taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies,
particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future
prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on
the companies' internal organization and the performance of our work.

The preparation of this Financial Information is under your responsibility. Our role is to express a
conclusion on this Financial Information based on our review.

F 2


-----

We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and the
professional guidance issued by the French Institute of statutory auditors (Compagnie nationale des
commissaires aux comptes) relating to this engagement. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily
of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance
that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we
do not express an audit opinion.

Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying
Financial Information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS
34 - the IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial information.

Without modifying the conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to note 6.3.2. which describes
lawsuits and disputes and related uncertainties.

This report is governed by French law. The courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any
claim or dispute resulting from our engagement letter or the present report, or any related matters. Each
party irrevocably waives its right to oppose any action brought before French courts, to claim that the
action is being brought before an illegitimate court or that the courts have no jurisdiction.

**VI – Notes to the condensed first-half consolidated financial statements**


**1. Overview**

**1.1. General information on the parent company**

The parent company, AFFLELOU, is a French joint stock company controlled by LION SENECA Lux 2,
headquartered at 11 rue d’Argenson, 75008 Paris. The “Group” comprises the parent company, which
wholly owns 3AB OPTICAL DEVELOPMENT (“3ABOD”) and its subsidiaries.

**1.2. General information on the group**

The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major
player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries
in Africa, Asia and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a
network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners.

The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue
generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their
purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of
products to franchisees, notably branded company products.

The Group owns a network of stores so as to (i) retain control over flagship stores located in strategic areas
and key geographies, (ii) test new business initiatives and identify best practices before applying them to
the franchisees, and (iii) manage the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at
the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group for
subsequent transfer to new franchisees.

Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com,
malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites.

**1.3. Context of the publication**

The condensed first-half consolidated financial statements for the six months on 31[st] January 2021 have
been prepared within the framework of a contemplated financing of its shareholders. These condensed
first-half consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union as of 1[st] August 2020. The rules applied
in preparing these financial statements are described in Note 3 “Accounting policies”. These condensed
first-half consolidated financial statements for the six months on 31[st] January 2021 were approved by the
Chairman of AFFLELOU on 8[th] April 2021.

The condensed first-half consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, unless
otherwise stated. The following tables contain data items that have been rounded up or down on an
individual basis. Arithmetic calculations based on rounded items may show discrepancies with the
aggregates or subtotals displayed herein.

**2. Highlights**

**2.1. COVID-19 epidemic**

In late calendar year 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China before spreading to
Europe, and notably our two main countries, France and Spain. In March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared COVID 19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world
implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID 19. These measures have adversely affected

F 8


-----

workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer
spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns, have led to an economic downturn
in our markets and have had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operate.
From mid-March to mid-May 2020, the governments of the countries in which we operate imposed
lockdown measures and, in doing so, required the temporary closure of materially all of our stores and, as
a result, almost all our revenues ceased until the phased reopening of our stores after May 11[th], 2020.

During the first phase of the pandemic, our efforts were primarily focused on supporting and advising our
franchisees (such as temporary layoffs, negotiations with landlords and tax arrangements), and assisting
them with temporary financing. We partially deferred maturities of our franchisees in a total amount of more
than €30 million from March to May 2020, with a twelve-month repayment schedule. The outstanding
amount of this support was €25 million as of 31[st] July 2020 and €12.6 million as of 31[st] January 2021. At
Group level, government measures including temporary layoffs and optimization of our expenses helped
limit the pandemic’s financial impact. As a precautionary measure, the Group approached its banking
partners to arrange a €30 million French government-backed (prêt garanti par l'état or "PGE") loan, which
was obtained in July 2020.

After a lull in the pandemic during the summer of 2020, during which we observed a strong rebound of
network sales, a "second wave" has been underway since mid-September 2020, with an acceleration in
October 2020. In response to this resurgence, governments and local administrations have adopted new
responsive measures and put in place a curfew in October 2020 in our main geographical areas and
subsequently adopted a second period of confinement from early November to early December 2020. In
France, due to the persistence of a large number of new infections, the appearance of coronavirus variants
and ongoing pressure on the health system, combined with a slow rollout of vaccinations, the Government
made the decision to put in place a new curfew that begins at 18:00 every day, which has been in effect
since mid-January 2021. Finally, since January 31, 2021, the French Government enforced closures of
shopping centers of 20,000 sqm and more. This measure was expanded at the beginning of March to cover
shopping centers of 10,000 sqm and more, together with more stringent local confinement measures in
areas where the pandemic could put a strong pressure on the health system. In Spain, the restrictions were
locally adapted to the spread of the pandemic, and generally were softer than in France, in recent months.

In France, due to the persistence of a large number of new infections in the population, the appearance of
coronavirus variants and ongoing pressure on the health system, combined with a slow rollout of
vaccinations, the Government made the decision to put in place a new night time curfew that begins at
18:00 every day (19:00 from March 20), in effect since mid-January 2021. In addition, the French
Government enforced closures of shopping centers of over 20,000 square meters nationwide since January
31, 2021 and of shopping centers of over 10,000 square meters in selected regions since March 6, 2021.
For the month of February 2021, the first wave of closures in French shopping centers impacted 130 stores,
of which 119 of our Alain Afflelou optical stores. A new confinement, which commenced on March 20, 2021
across 16 French departments is planned to last four weeks, and will allow, as in November, essential
businesses, including ours, to remain open, apart from those in shopping centers already closed.
Meanwhile, as of March 20, 2021, the curfew was reduced by one hour, beginning at 19:00, instead of
18:00. The new restrictive measures in smaller shopping centers increased the number of our stores which
must be closed by c.35 stores to approximately 165, (of which c.150 Alain Afflelou optical stores). On March
31, the President made an announcement of extension of restriction measures all over the country. Optical
and hearing aid stores are still considered essential businesses, so that this recent announcement won’t
sharply impact the current situation unless a strong change in the number of stores closed in shopping
centers is decided. In Spain, consumer activities generally are subject to lighter restrictions as compared
to France.

At the same time, the Group continues to support its franchisees, as it has done since the beginning of the
pandemic. The recent restrictive measures also had an impact on our directly owned stores, to a greater
degree than the rest of our network, as our directly-owned stores are often located in the types shopping
centers that are currently required to be closed. The Group reacted rapidly, implementing temporary layoffs
in the closed stores.

**2.2. Change of the President**

On December 22nd, 2020, the Group announce the appointment of Mr. Tarek Hosni as Chief Executive
Officer, replacing Mr. Didier Pascual. This appointment allows the company to chart a new course to in its

development. Tarek Hosni, 63, a specialist in business transformation, brings 35 years of experience in
change management to the Group. He was previously Managing Director of C&A France, with the mission
of implementing European strategy.

**2.3. Network evolution**

The Group had 1 342 optical stores and 93 audio stores (excluding 277 corners inside optical stores) as of
31st January 2021, breaking down as 958 stores in France, 336 in Spain and 141 in other countries. The
portfolio of directly owned stores, located mainly in France and Spain, represented 159 optical stores and
1 audio store (excluding 26 corners inside optical stores) stores as of 31st January 2021.

**3. Accounting policies**

**3.1. Standards and rules applied**

In accordance with European regulation EC n ° 1606/2002 of July 19, 2002 on international accounting
standards, the Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared according to the principles
defined by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board), as adopted by the European Union.
These standards are available on the website of the European Commission:
http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02008R1126-20160101

The international standards include IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), IAS (International
Accounting Standards), as well as their interpretations SIC (Standing Interpretations Committee) and IFRIC
(International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee).

The condensed half year consolidated financial statements for the six months on 31st January 2021 were

**3.2. Specific estimations used for the preparation of interim financial statements**

**3.2.1.** **Income tax**
The tax expense for the period (current and deferred) is determined on the basis of the estimated effective
tax rate for the current fiscal year for each tax entity and sub-group.

**3.2.2.** **Employee benefits**
The first-half expense related to post-employment benefits is equal to two-quarter of the net cost calculated
for the year ended 31 July 2021. Pursuant to the requirements of IAS 19 and IAS 34, the net postemployment benefit obligation stated in the interim financial statements takes into account significant
changes in market conditions. There were no significant changes in market conditions during the first-half
of the year ended 31[st] July 2021.

**3.2.3.** **Seasonal pattern of revenue**
Income from ordinary activities, operating income and all operating indicators are characterized by a low
level of seasonality attributable to the recurrence of business throughout the year.

**4. Use of estimates and assumptions**

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine the
value of assets and liabilities, assessment of positive and negative contingencies at the closing date, as
well as income and charges for the period. The significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation
of the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including
trademarks), the measurement of provisions and asset impairment, and the assumptions used for the
measurement of debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process,
the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future
results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are
described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following
notes:

**6.3. Contingent liabilities, off-balance sheet contractual commitments and contingencies**

**6.3.1.** **Change in off-balance sheet commitments**

No significant changes in commitments given or received, contractual obligations, pledges or collateral are
to be noted compared with 31[st] July 2020, except for :

  - commitments given : securities and bank guarantees in Spain and France which have decreased
by €1,1 million and €2,5 million respectively due to the decrease of franchisees' outstanding
balances with banks;

  - commitments received : liabilities related to the central payment structure increased by €1,6 million
due to the increase in franchisee outstandings balance with Afflelou over the period, which are
guaranteed by personal sureties.

**6.3.2.** **Notification, lawsuits and disputes**

Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of
their business, including disputes with tax, social security or customs authorities.

The French Competition Authority investigation

On 27 May 2015, the French Competition Authority notified Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of grievances,
accusing it of “having colluded with providers of eye- and sunglass frames, from 2003 at the earliest and
until 2009, to fix retail prices and to impede the fixing of prices through free competition in violation of the
provisions of Article L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 paragraph 1 of the TFEU”.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur responded to the grievances laid out by the French Competition Authority on 27
July 2015, vigorously contesting them on all points. In July 2016, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received a
report from the French Competition Authority in response. The report rejected the arguments put forward
by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, but nevertheless narrowed the period of the alleged practices, stating that
the practices at issue were spread as regards Alain Afflelou Franchiseur between 25 February 2005 and
31 December 2009. The report also capped the potential penalty at approximately €12.5 million.

The French Competition Authority issued a decision on the vertical agreement grievances on 24 February
2017. It decided to refer the issue back for further investigations. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the
new investigation, bearing in mind that it was deemed at this stage of the proceedings that collusion had
not been identified. The referral should result in a complementary notification. It is not possible to assess
the amount of any fine to which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur may be liable if the case brought by the French
Competition Authority is successful.

On 19 April 2019, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received notification of additional grievances in which no
grievance was filed against it. No response was therefore given to this notification.

On 2 March 2020, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received the additional report from the French Competition
Authority. Even though Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is still not concerned by the additional grievances, it
nevertheless issued a response to the Competition Authority on certain procedural arguments of interest
to it.

In the state of this additional complaint notice of 2019 and this additional report of 2020, the Company Alain
Afflelou Franchisor remains concerned only by the initial notice of grievances which, as recalled above,
had been considered unsatisfactory by the Company.

The case was raised during a session (hearing) of the Competition Authority on January 13, 2021.

During this session, all the parties to the proceedings invoked the prescription of the file, relying on a
judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal of December 3, 2020 (Brenntag case) in which the Court rejected
the sole argument procedure invoked by the investigation services to oppose the argument relating to the
prescription of the file.

F 18


-----

Logically, the Competition Authority should align itself with the Paris Court of Appeal's position concerning
the prescription, unless it intends to resist this position in the hope of a possible quashing of this decision.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, which continues to believe itself to be in the right, intends to continue contesting
the French Competition Authority’s allegations vigorously. Accordingly, no provision for this litigation has
been recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
VAT Deductibility Notification

On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT
deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities
amounted to €1.5 million.

Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group decided to pay the sum
corresponding to the principal adjustment of €966 thousand. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter
to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The Group also
called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which
are capped at €1 million.

Tax disputes on income taxes

As a result of a tax audit launched in 2015 with respect to the period from August 1, 2009 to July 31, 2012,
the French tax authorities issued a first tax reassessment notice mainly reassessing the price at which
Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss making subsidiaries holdings in 2010, claiming that such sale
price should have been higher in order to be considered arm's length. The Company and its legal and tax
advisers believe there are robust arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities.

A second tax reassessment notice was issued in December 2018 in respect of the income tax expense for
fiscal years ended July 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, relating to the deductibility of the 14% interest expense
on the convertible bonds issued in July 2012 as part of the Group’s acquisition by the current shareholders,
in an amount of approximately €203 million. The French tax authorities challenged the deductibility of
interest on these convertible bonds on the grounds that these bonds were in fact an equity financing by
the shareholders, the deduction of the interest consequently constituting an abuse of law under French
law. The Group, on the basis of the analysis carried out by our legal and tax advisers, challenged the
position of the French tax authorities in a response sent in February 2019. In March 2021, the French tax
authorities confirmed their position in principle and launched a second tax audit with respect to the fiscal
years ended July 31, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforward amounted to €65.4 million as of January 31, 2021.
If the French tax authorities were to prevail concerning the two disputes, it could result in a reduction of the
amount of tax loss carryforwards for an estimated amount of deferred tax assets of approximately €58
million and could result in payment of income taxes for the years subject to reassessments as well as the
following years up to the January 31, 2021 and related penalties for a maximum estimated amount as of
the date hereof of approximately €21 million based on the current status of the procedure.

Control of supplier payment deadlines

On September 21, 2020, the DIRECCTE initiated a control in line with the commitment made by the
company Alain Afflelou Franchiseur to respect the legal payment deadlines formulated when its request
was made to obtain a loan guaranteed by the State (PGE).

On the March 2, 2021 The Company made its observations on the payment deadlines controled by the
DIRECCTE over the period from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021 and submitted all the documents in
support of said observations.

At this stage, the DIRECCTE has not formulated any response.

Statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements

Year ended 31 July 2020

To the of shareholders of Afflelou:
_Opinion_

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Afflelou for the year ended 31 July 2020. These
financial statements were approved by the President on 19 November 2020 on the basis of the
information available at that date in the evolving context of the Covid-19 crisis and of difficulties in
assessing its impact and future prospects. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a
true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 July 2020
and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
_Basis for Opinion_

Audit Framework

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for
_the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements"_ section of our report.

Independence

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the
period from 1[st] August 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited
non-audit services referred to in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.
_Emphasis of Matter_

Without modifying the opinion expressed above, we draw your attention on:

   - Note 4.1.1 “Standards, interpretations and amendments mandatory as of 1 August 2019” to the
consolidated financial statements which sets out the impact of the mandatory application as of 1[st]
August 2019 of IFRS 16 « Leases »;

_Justification of Assessments_

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following
assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, as approved in the conditions above-mentioned
context, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items
of the consolidated financial statements. Impairment tests on trademarks, goodwill and other intangible
assets with an indefinite useful life are performed in accordance with the method described in Note 6.2.5
to the financial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the method implemented based on a
range of estimates and examined the data and assumptions used by the Group in performing these tests.
On this basis, we assessed the reasonableness of these estimates.
_Specific Verification_

We have also performed in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the specific
verifications required by laws and regulations of the information pertaining to the Group given in the
management report of the president as approved on 19 November 2020. With regard to the events which
occurred and the facts known after the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements relating
to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, management indicated to us that they will be communicated to the
shareholders called to decide on these financial statements.
We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.
_Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial_
_Statements_

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company
or to cease operations.

The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President.

_Statutory Auditors Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.
As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include
assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

F 22


-----

- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control.

- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

- Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This
assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory
auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation

Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The
statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the
consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial
statements.

**VI – Notes to the consolidated financial statements**


**_1._** **_Overview_**


**_1.1._** **_General information on the parent company_**

The parent company, AFFLELOU, is a French joint stock company controlled by LION SENECA Lux 2,
headquartered at 11 rue d’Argenson, 75008 Paris. The “Group” comprises the parent company, which
wholly owns 3AB OPTICAL DEVELOPMENT (“3ABOD”) and its subsidiaries.

The Chairman of AFFLELOU approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial
statements for the year ended 31 July 2020 on 19 November 2020.

**_1.2._** **_General information on the Group_**

The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major
player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries
in Africa, Asia and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a
network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners.

The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue
generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their
purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of
products to franchisees, notably branded company products.

The Group owns a network of stores so as to (i) retain control over flagship stores located in strategic areas
and key geographies, (ii) test new business initiatives and identify best practices before applying them to
the franchisees, and (iii) manage the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at
the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group for
subsequent transfer to new franchisees.

Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com,
malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites.

**_2._** **_Highlights_**

**_2.1._** **_Change in the networks_**

The Group had 1,429 stores (1,336 optical stores and 93 audio stores) as of 31 July 2020, compared with
1,425 stores (1,342 optical stores and 83 audio stores) as of 31 July 2019. The expansion of our networks
was slowed last year by the continued downscaling of the Optical Discount store base.

The portfolio of 93 audio stores is complemented by 262 spaces in optical stores in France and Spain,
bringing the total number of audio outlets to 355, compared with 319 as of 31 July 2019.

As of 31 July 2020, the Group operated in 19 countries, split into three zones: France with 961 points of
sale, Spain with 328 points of sale, and other countries representing 140 points of sale.

The portfolio of directly owned stores, located mainly in France and Spain, represented 150 optical stores
and 1 audio store as of 31 July 2020, compared with 162 optical stores and no audio stores as of 31 July
2019.

**_2.2._** **_Change in the Group’s debt_**

Despite the sharp drop in activity stemming from the COVID-19 epidemic and the considerable extension
of payment terms granted to our franchisees, the Group was able to reduce its external financial debt

F 30


-----

(excluding IFRS 16 and convertibles bonds) by €11 million net of cash and cash equivalents. However, the
Group obtained a €30 million government-guaranteed loan as a precautionary measure in July 2020.

**_2.3._** **_Implementation of the scheme ensuring the full refund of healthcare costs in the optical and_**
**_audio sectors in France_**

The optical and audio sectors have seen the implementation of regulatory changes guaranteeing the full
refund of healthcare costs since 1 January 2020, which will be completed for the audio sector in January
2021. The new scheme, known as _100% Santé, establishes two segments for opticians and audio_
practitioners, a free segment and an administered segment offering a basket of treatments ensuring that
eyeglass and hearing aid wearers are treated with no out-of-pocket expenses. For optics, segment A,
known by the French acronym RAC0 (for zero out-of-pocket expenses), is based on a price of
approximately €100 for the provision of single-vision lenses and €200 for progressive lenses. These
products are priced well below the averages observed in the market (€287 and €555 respectively according
to a 2019 Galileo study). The 100% Santé scheme also reduces the ceiling for refunds on frames by mutual
insurance companies to €100. Equivalent provisions are being phased in for the audio sector, where the
gradual arrival of zero out-of-pocket expenses arrangements has prompted a wait-and-see attitude among
wearers and as such a decline in the market, even before the COVID-19 epidemic. In view of technical
difficulties in the new scheme early in the year, followed by the massive upheavals caused by the epidemic,
it is very hard to measure the actual impact of 100% Santé on our sector, and above all the proportion of
customers opting for segment A products (lenses or frames, or both).

**_2.4._** **_COVID-19 epidemic_**

At the end of the 2019 calendar year, a new coronavirus, COVID-19, was detected in China before
spreading to Europe, and notably our two main countries, France and Spain. To stem the spread of the
epidemic, most European governments imposed stringent lockdown measures from mid-March onwards.
These measures resulted in an abrupt and near total shutdown of all of our activities, more than 99% of
which were carried out by the stores in our networks, over a period covering nearly two months, from midMarch to mid-May. The immediate consequence of these measures was naturally the collapse of revenues
in our networks, and in turn those of our Group.

The Group responded very quickly to this exceptional environment.

Financially, our efforts were focused primarily on supporting our franchisees. The abrupt cessation of
activity caused a almost stop in their revenues, while expenses continued to accumulate and supplies still
had to be paid for. We therefore supported our franchisees in their various procedures (furlough for
employees, negotiations with landlords, tax arrangements, one-off assistance), and also facilitated the
granting of financing, if necessary with our guarantee. Lastly, we partially deferred maturities in a total
amount of more than €30 million from March to May; their repayment is due mostly in the coming fiscal
year, the outstanding amount as of 31 July having already been reduced to approximately €25 million.

At the AFFLELOU Group level, government measures including furlough schemes for employees and the
optimisation of our expenses between March and May helped limit the pandemic’s financial impact. As a
precautionary measure, the Group nevertheless approached its banking partners to arrange a €30 million
government-guaranteed loan, obtained in July 2020.

**_2.5._** **_Merger by absorption of Tchin Management 3_**

On 31 January 2020, AFFLELOU took over Tchin Management 3, which was wound up without liquidation
with retroactive effect to the first day of the fiscal year, i.e. 1 August 2019. The following transactions were
recorded at the consolidated level by decision of the Chairman on 27 January 2020:

  - cash capital increase of €2,546,504.35 to €236,078,157.55 through the issue of 4,768,922 ADP D
preference shares with a par value of €0.534 each plus a total share premium of €10,443,939.18;

  - cash capital reduction in a nominal amount of €4,596,596.70 to €231,481,560.85 through the
cancellation of 8,607,859 shares with a par value of €0.534 each in connection with the merger by
absorption of Tchin Management 3.

**_3._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation_**


**_3.1._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2020_**

Following its acquisition on 31 July 2019, AA OC MAG, owner and operator of six stores, was merged into
L’opticien Afflelou (LOA) on 31 January 2020. As a result of this merger, AA OC MAG was wound up
without liquidation with retroactive effect to the first day of the fiscal year, i.e. 1 August 2019. In addition,
Tchin Management 3 was merged into AFFLELOU on 31 January 2020 (see Note 2.5). Lastly, the Group
acquired Spanish company ARKANIA VISION, operating 1 store, in July 2020.

**_3.2._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2019_**

The main changes in scope were the merger by way of takeover of Digital Eyewear by Alain Afflelou
Franchiseur and its winding up without liquidation with retroactive effect to the first day of the fiscal year,
i.e. 1 August 2018. As part of the disposal of the Optimil discount banner in Spain, Polus was sold in
October 2018. The Group acquired, during the year ending July 31 2019, three Spanish companies
(Cecimar Opticos, Paladio Vision and Feyla Opticos SL) managing a total of five stores as part of its
strategy of developing directly owned stores. During the year ending July 31, 2019, Cecimar Opticos,
Paladio Viso, Feyla Opticos and Opticas Azahar were merged with Alain Afflelou Optico (AAO). Lastly, the
Group acquired AA OC MAG, comprising six stores, on 31 July 2019.

**_4._** **_Accounting policies_**

**_4.1._** **_Standards and rules applied_**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2020 were prepared in
accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting
Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 of 19 July
2002. These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International
Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS
IC), as approved in the European Union, application of which was mandatory as of the year under review,
which are available on the website of the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/finance/companyreporting/index_en.htm).

The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in
preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2019, with the exception of new
standards, amendments and interpretations applicable in financial years beginning on or after 1 August
2019:

**_4.1.1. Standards, interpretations and amendments mandatory as of 1 August 2019_**

- IFRS 16 Leases;

- Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Provisions Providing for Negative Compensation;

- Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures;

- Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits – Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement;

- Annual improvements, 2015-2017 cycle;

- IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.
The impact of IFRS 16 is described below.
The other standards, amendments to standards or interpretations do not have a material impact on the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2020.

- **IFRS 16 Leases.**

On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard on leases, IFRS 16. The new standard, which
replaces IAS 17 and its interpretations, has resulted in the recognition of most leases using a single
accounting model in the balance sheet, on the assets side comprising a right-of-use asset representing the
right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing the obligation to make payments
(replacing the classification as operating or finance leases for lessees). The new standard, adopted by the
European Union, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and was therefore

F 32


-----

applied by the Group from 1 August 2019. Most of the Group’s leases are property leases for the rental of
commercial premises and, to a lesser extent, office space. The Group is also an intermediary lessor
because it has concluded sublease agreements with franchisees.

The Group elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach offered by the standard. As of 1
August 2019, the lease liability was calculated by discounting the remaining rents at the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate at that date, taking into account the estimated remaining term of the various
leases. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate used by the Group at the transition date was
4.7%. The rents taken into account are fixed or variable based on an index or an interest rate. Variable
rents do not give rise to the calculation of a lease liability.

In application of these provisions, the information for the 2018/2019 fiscal year presented as comparison
with the information for the 2019/2020 fiscal year has not been restated.

On the transition date, right-of-use assets were recognised in an amount equal to that of the lease liability
or, as permitted by the standard, by determining their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied
since the most recent of the inception date of the lease or the date of takeover of the entity/activity carrying
the lease within the meaning of IFRS 3, and then discounting it using its incremental borrowing rate at the
date of first-time application. This option was used for the most material leases. The Group has also
decided to make use of the exemptions permitted by the standard for short-term leases (less than 12
months) or for low-value assets.

In addition, the following simplification measures offered by IFRS 16 were applied in the transition:

   - The discount rates applied as of the transition date were based on the Group’s incremental
borrowing rate plus a spread to take into account the specific economic environments of each
country;

   - The Group used the benefit of experience to determine the term of lease agreements containing
extension or termination options.

The application of IFRS 16 required the exercise of judgement, particularly with regard to:

    - The definition of a lease;

   - The determination of the lease term, which takes into account the exercise of termination or
renewal options when the Group is reasonably certain of exercising them; the terms adopted
take into account the decisions of the IFRIC at the end of 2019 concerning the assessment of
the lease term based on an economic (as opposed to strictly legal) approach, as well as its
interaction with any non-removable fixtures and fittings linked to it;

   - The determination of the incremental borrowing rate, which was calculated taking into account
residual lease terms on the date of first-time application.
For the Group’s leases as lessor, the analysis carried out ahead of the transition caused the Group to
classify them as finance leases. This classification resulted in the derecognition of the right-of-use asset
relating to the main lease and the recognition of the net investment in the sublease as a financial receivable.
Sublease agreements result in the recognition of financial income corresponding to the effect of
discounting.

The Group’s accounting policies relating to leases, updated as a result of the application of IFRS 16, are
presented in Note 4.9. A reconciliation of total commitments under operating leases as of 31 July 2019 and
lease liabilities recognised as of 1 August 2019 was performed as follows:

**In €k** **Amounts**
**Amount of the off-balance sheet commitment as of 31/07/2019** **27,739**

+ Difference related to the term (consideration of renewal or termination options) _77,436_

The impacts of the first-time application of IFRS 16 on the opening balance sheet are:

      - recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities;

      - reclassification of lease incentives and leasehold rights as an increase in right-of-use assets;

      - reclassification of prepaid rents as an increase in right-of-use assets;

      - reclassification of right-of-use assets as financial receivables in the case of subleases granted
over the residual term of the relevant leases.

In addition, as part of the transition to IFRS 16, the Group conducted an analysis of leasehold and similar
rights, which resulted in a portion of them being reclassified as right-of-use assets and the balance as
goodwill. The portion reallocated to goodwill is allocated outside normal accounting to each store in
question and will be taken into account in calculating impairment on each of these stores.

**_4.2._** **_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the
takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control.

**_4.2.1. Consolidated entities_**

The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 _Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, when it:_
 has power over the investee;
 is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining
economic benefits.

Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income
derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of
subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the
Group as a whole.

**_4.2.2. Associates_**

The Group has no interests in joint ventures or associates.

**_4.2.3. Business combinations_**

The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method:
 the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including
any earn-out payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earnout payment are recognised in profit or loss;

F 35


-----

 the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by
goodwill, which is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position.

The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis
when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value
has been determined, adjustments are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur
within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and
circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognised directly
in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the
proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured:
 either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognised for the portion related to non-controlling
interests (full goodwill method);
 or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only
goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method).

Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating
income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are
measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognised either as adjustments to the
consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the
provisions of IFRS 3.

In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is
remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine
goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value
previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in
respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is reclassified to profit or loss.

**_4.3._** **_Basis of valuation, judgements and use of estimates_**

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS
require or permit the use of the fair value option.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the
value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and
valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of
the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including
trademarks), the measurement of provisions and asset impairment, and the assumptions used for the
measurement of debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process,
the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future
results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are
described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following
notes:

**Note** **Estimate** **Nature of estimate**

**_4.4._** **_Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates_**

**_4.4.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency at
the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange
differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognised in “Other financial income” or “Other
financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised directly in other
comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of the said gain or loss is also recognised in other
comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of foreign
exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in Note 4.11.
Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date,
and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at the date the fair
value was determined.

**_4.4.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies_**

The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their
respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity
operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
into euros as follows:
 items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate
prevailing on the balance sheet date;
 items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period,
as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations;
 differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance
sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the
period are recognised in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation”.

**_4.5._** **_Intangible assets excluding goodwill_**

An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and
controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An
intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or
contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis
over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually within the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which they
belong. Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria:
 Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition;
 Prospective long-term profitability.
Licences and software have useful lives of between one and four years, and are amortised over the relevant
period.

**_4.6._** **_Property, plant and equipment_**

**_4.6.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial
consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the
alternative method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant and
equipment. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

**_4.6.2. Depreciation_**

The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment
held:

F 37


-----

Property, plant and equipment Useful life Depreciation method

Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line
Industrial machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Straight line
Technical equipment under finance leases 3 to 10 years Straight line
Other property, plant and equipment 3 to 5 years Straight line

**_4.7._** **_Impairment of non-current assets (IAS 36)_**

Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items
are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also
performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment, CGUs or groups of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from
unfavourable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used as
of the acquisition date.

Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of
CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset, CGU or group of CGUs is the
greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on
projections of expected future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalisation
in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair
value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the
recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment
loss is recognised against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs,
the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other nonrecurring operating items” in the income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may
be reversed later if the recoverable amount later comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses
recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.

On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another
method is deemed more pertinent.

**_4.8._** **_Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale_**

Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly
likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated
first to goodwill and then to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment
losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well
as gains and losses on subsequent measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer
amortised or depreciated.

Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that:
      - represents a separate activity or geographical area,
      - is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area,
      - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.

The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an
earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

F 38

|Property, plant and equipment|Useful life|Depreciation method|
|---|---|---|
|Buildings Industrial machinery and equipment Technical equipment under finance leases Other property, plant and equipment|10 to 20 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 5 years|Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line|


-----

When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other
comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at
the beginning of the comparative period.

**_4.9._** **_Leases_**

Application of IAS 17 until 31 July 2019:

In the course of its various business activities, the Group uses assets made available or makes assets
available under lease arrangements. Such leases are analysed on the basis of the situations and indicators
set out in IAS 17 Leases to determine whether they are operating or finance leases.

 The Group as lessee

    - Finance leases: on initial recognition, assets held under finance leases are recognised as property,
plant and equipment with offsetting debt. The asset is recognised at the fair value of the leased
asset at the date of inception of the contract, or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease
payments. It is depreciated over the term of the contract.

    - Operating leases: payments made under operating leases (other than the costs of services such
as insurance and maintenance) are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.

 The Group as lessor
All lease management contracts signed by the Group with its franchisees are operating leases.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the fixed terms of commercial leases.

Application of IFRS 16 since 1 August 2019:

 The Group as lessee
Leases giving the lessee control over the use of an identified asset for a given period in exchange for
consideration fall within the scope of IFRS 16. The Group’s lessee companies recognise all leases,
regardless of their nature, whether operating or finance leases, in the form of a right-of-use asset in
exchange for a lease liability on the liability side of the balance sheet.

The lease liability is initially determined on the basis of the present value of future lease payments,
discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or at the incremental
borrowing rate specific to the country, terms and currency of the lease. Lease payments include fixed
payments, variable payments based on a benchmark or rate and payments arising from options that are
reasonably certain to be exercised.

After the initial measurement, the lease liability is reduced by the payments made and increased by the
interest expense. It is remeasured to reflect any change in future lease payments in the event of further
negotiations with the lessor, a change in a benchmark or rate, or if options are reassessed. When the lease
liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or recognised in
profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero in the case
of a reduction in the scope of leases.

The right-of-use asset determined at the outset includes the initial lease liability, the initial direct costs, any
leasehold rights and any obligations to renovate the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessor.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. In the income statement, depreciation
expense is recognised in operating profit or loss, and interest expense in financial income or expense. The
tax impact of this consolidation restatement is taken into account through the recognition of deferred taxes.

The lease term used corresponds to the non-cancellable period, to periods covered by an extension option
whose exercise is reasonably certain, and to periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise
is reasonably certain, taking into account the economics of the lease (and not only the legal characteristics),
as well as the impact of any non-removable fixtures and fittings related to the lease that could constitute
an incentive to exercise a renewal option.

F 39


-----

The Group applies the exemptions permitted by IFRS 16 for leases with a term of less than 12 months or
where the underlying asset is of low value (less than €5,000).

 The Group as lessor
The Group has leases that are subleased to third parties (mainly franchisees). As lessor, the Group
classifies its leases as operating or finance leases.

A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to
ownership of the underlying asset, and otherwise as an operating lease.
For finance leases, the Group recognises the amount of the net investment as a financial receivable and
derecognises the right-of-use asset of the related lease. Any difference between the right-of-use asset and
the net investment in the sublease agreement is recognised in profit or loss. The lease liability of the main
lease is maintained as a liability.

A lease is classified as an operating lease if the classification criteria (described above) are not met. For
operating leases, the lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over
the term of the lease.

**_4.10._** **_Other financial assets and liabilities_**

In accordance with the principles of IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments, financial assets are recognised and_
measured either at amortised cost, at fair value through equity or at fair value through profit or loss based
on the following two criteria:

  - an initial criterion relating to the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of each instrument.
The analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to determine whether these
flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (the so-called SPPI
test);

  - a second criterion relating to the business model used by the company to manage its financial
assets. IFRS 9 defines three different business models: (i) a first business model whose objective
is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, (ii) a second model whose economic
objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling financial assets, and
(iii) “other” business models.

Identifying the business model and analysing the characteristics of the contractual cash flows involves
judgement to ensure that financial assets are classified in the appropriate category.

Where the financial asset is an investment in an equity instrument and is not held for trading, the Group
may make an irrevocable election to present the gains and losses on this investment in other
comprehensive income.

With the exception of trade receivables, which are measured in accordance with their transaction price
within the meaning of IFRS 15, financial assets are, upon initial recognition, measured at fair value plus, in
the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs
directly attributable to their acquisition.

At each balance sheet date, financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through equity
(recyclable) are subject to impairment testing based on the method used to estimate expected credit losses.

Financial assets also include derivative financial instruments that are valued at fair value in accordance
with the standards.

**_4.11._** **_Derivatives_**

In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet in other
current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and
carried at fair value as of the transaction date. Change in the fair value of derivative instruments is always
recognised in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied.

Hedge accounting is only applied if the following conditions are met:

F 40


-----

 a hedging relationship is clearly identified, formalised and documented from the date of its
inception;
 the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated prospectively and retrospectively.
Confidence in the results obtained must be within a range of 80% to 125%.
Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair
value. The effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in
profit or loss.

**_4.12._** **_Inventories_**

Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens
products (held as part of the Group’s central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly owned
stores (consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products).

Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any
unsold items so as to align them with their realisable values.

Inventories held in stores are subject to impairment, in accordance with the following rules:
 20% for products unsold for more than one year
 40% for products unsold for more than two years
 80% for products unsold for more than three years
 100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer
marketed.

**_4.13._** **_Other current assets and liabilities_**

**_4.13.1. Trade receivables and other current assets_**

Trade receivables are carried at amortised cost. Receivables relating to the central payment and
purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. Impairment is recognised when the outstanding
carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Other current assets chiefly include receivables in
respect of the central payment activity, including franchisees’ payments for their purchases from the
referenced suppliers, as well as the discounts granted by such suppliers to franchisees, to be passed on
to franchisees. Impairment is recognised when the outstanding carrying amount exceeds the recoverable
amount.

**_4.13.2. Trade payables and other current liabilities_**

Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at
amortised cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity,
including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers,
to be passed on to franchisees.

**_4.14._** **_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of
investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held in order to meet shortterm cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of
cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in assets in the balance
sheet less bank overdrafts, presented in financial liabilities.

**_4.15._** **_Provisions and contingent liabilities_**

A contingent liability is:
 a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity;
or
 a present obligation arising from past events but which is not recognised because:

F 41


-----

      - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; or
      - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A provision is recognised when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement
of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming
amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are
subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant
retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including
rental expenses, taxes and related expenses), less any sublease income.

**_4.16._** **_Employee benefits and similar_**

Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types
of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to
make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does
not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the
current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for
the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes.

Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis
of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives
rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final
obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations
vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. The
biggest such plans and termination payments are subject to an actuarial valuation by independent actuaries
every year; valuations are performed at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account
the level of future compensation, the probable length of employment, life expectancy and staff turnover.

Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated
results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined
benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognised in income from ordinary activities. Reductions,
settlements and past service costs are recognised in income from ordinary activities. The provision
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair
value of plan assets.

**_4.17._** **_Borrowings_**

**_4.17.1. Loans and other financial liabilities_**

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognised at fair value less
transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective
interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying amount of a
financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest date to repricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums and/or
discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a
financial liability.

Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at
amortised cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk.
Hedging relationships are described in Note 4.11 “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the
fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are
expensed as incurred.

**_4.17.2. Compound instruments_**

F 42


-----

Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the
case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognised in shareholders’
equity and in loans and financial liabilities, on the basis of their respective weighting, in accordance with
IAS 32 _Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their_
measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption),
discounted at the market rate (taking into account the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination)
of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or
redeemable for shares. The portion recognised in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount
of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected
disbursements over the term of the loan in order to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan
recorded in borrowings.

**_4.18._** **_Taxes_**

**_4.18.1. Current taxes_**

The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its
income is taxable. The Group recognises the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée
_des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on_
the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**_4.18.2. Deferred tax_**

In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they
are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability
settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognised in profit or loss for the
year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also
recognised directly in equity.

A deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to investments in
subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary difference is reversed, or
if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.

Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carry-forwards and tax credits are limited
to the estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end
of the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are not discounted.

**_4.19._** **_Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current_**

For the majority of the Group’s activities, it has been decided that the criterion for this classification is the
date of liquidation of the asset or settlement of the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current
if more than 12 months.

**_4.20._** **_Revenue recognition_**

The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services:

 Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged
to franchisees. Revenue is recognised as and when control of the service is transferred over the
duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognised on the date on which
the underlying sale occurs.
 Network sales revenues: sales to franchisees of lenses, contact lenses and frames through the
Group’s central purchasing structure. These sales of products trademarked ALAIN AFFLELOU are
recognised on the date of transfer of control to exclusive distributors and franchisees. Referral,

F 43


-----

delcredere and distribution commissions to referenced suppliers and finder’s fees are accounted
for as and when sales are made.
 Revenues from directly owned stores: retail sales of directly owned stores operating under the
“ALAIN AFFLELOU” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners, and sales resulting from the “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” hearing aid activity. Revenue is recognised on the date of transfer of
control.
The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted.

**_4.21._** **_Cost of purchases_**

The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely:
 The cost of purchasing and supplying eyeglass frames
 The cost of purchasing and supplying eyeglass lenses
 The cost of purchasing and supplying contact lenses
 The purchasing cost of accessories and other goods
 Change in inventories of all of the above purchases
 The direct cost of communication

**_4.22._** **_Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items_**

Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the
Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To
facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items
for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other non-current operating items”. Other operating income
and expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include:
 restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures;
 impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognised primarily following impairment testing of
cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill;
 capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation and acquisitions or
disposals of tangibles and intangibles assets;
 major disputes.
These items, excluded from operating income due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be
considered as part of operating income from the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events
that are both limited in scope and very unusual.

**_4.23._** **_Operating profit_**

Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether
such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant
items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”.

**_5._** **_Segment reporting_**

**_5.1._** **_Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments_**

The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography into three areas, namely “France”, “Spain”
and “Other countries”. The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central
purchasing unit, a central listing and payment unit, and directly owned stores. The “France” segment also
includes an audio business operated under a master franchise agreement. The Group has replicated the
established organisation of its French operations in Spain, and aims ultimately to repeat this process in the
“Other countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment notably includes Belgium, Switzerland and
Portugal. This segment includes a central purchasing unit in Belgium, and has only a few directly owned
stores, in Portugal.

The segment reporting presented here was prepared on the basis of the internal reporting data reviewed
by the Chairman and CEO, the Group’s “chief operating decision maker” within the meaning of IFRS 8,
who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them.

F 44


-----

Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business
performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial
indicators used to measure segment performance are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. These two
indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note, and are reconciled
with operating income from ordinary activities.

Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in
“Other countries”:
 The trading company specialising in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB);
 The Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds international supplier contracts for the
entire Group.

The trading activity (AAB) and international supplier contract activity (AAI) impact the entire Group. The
geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the
“Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the
results of these trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following
allocation key:
 The result of the AAB trading branch in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating
country of franchisees in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames delivered during
the year;
 Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognised as
revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in
proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers.

The chief operating decision maker does not review a geographical breakdown of information regarding
the Group’s assets and liabilities. Information on the Group’s various activities and services is provided in
Note 1.2, Note 4.20 on revenue recognition and Note 6.1.1 on revenue by activity.

**_5.3._** **_Discontinued operations_**

Management undertook a plan to dispose of the entire Optimil business during the fiscal year ended 31
July 2018 as part of a strategic decision to refocus the Group on its key areas of expertise. This transaction
was finalised in October 2018. In addition, as of 31 July 2018, the Optivisao securities were classified as
assets held for sale with no impact on the income statement. The group sold its stake in the year ended 31
July 2019; the receivable resulting from that transaction will be settled in 2021. These two transactions
were classified as discontinued operations in fiscal 2018.

The losses of the French tax group including AFFLELOU, AAFR, 3ABOD, 3ABOE, OPTICAL FINANCE,
LOA and LSFA can be carried forward for an unlimited period. Losses before the entry into the tax group
of L’opticien Afflelou (LOA) can be carried forward for an unlimited period on an individual basis. Losses
before the entry into the tax group of F2L, ACADEMIE VISION, GROUPE OPTICAL MEDITERANEE and
CATHARE OPTIQUE can be carried forward for an unlimited time on an individual basis.
  - For French companies, the amount of tax losses offset in a given fiscal year may not exceed €1
million, plus 50% of the amount of the profit above this threshold. Losses can only be carried back
to the year prior to that in respect of which the tax loss is recognised, within a limit of €1 million.
  - Losses generated in Portugal since 2014 must be used within 12 years. In addition, effective 1
January 2012, the amount of losses that may be offset in a given fiscal year is capped at 75% of
taxable income for that year.
  - The tax losses of Spanish companies can be carried forward for a period of no more than 18 years.

**_6.1.9. Earnings per share_**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares less
the weighted average number of shares held by consolidated companies.

Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares defined above, plus the
weighted average number of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive shares are: shares
granted in connection with convertible bonds issued at the time of the Group’s refinancing on 17 July 2012,
which include bonds convertible into shares (OCA), i.e. potentially 96,264,603 shares; and shares granted
in connection with class A mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 6,596,000 shares, and class B
mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 9,520,000 shares. The instruments issued by the Group did not
have any dilutive effect in fiscal 2019 or 2020. The maximum number of potential dilutive shares in a
subsequent year is 112,380,603.

_6.2.6.1. Nature of impairment testing_

The Group first tests the assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores, then trademarks and
ultimately goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs.
Impairment testing of assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores is performed on a store-by-store
basis, based on the estimated market value. When in the course of negotiations the Group has indicative
offers, it uses them to measure the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the
probable selling price, calculated on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each
store, in line with potential market conditions.

In 2016, the original goodwill was allocated, following the change in the Group’s internal reporting structure,
to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to
adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not on its own account generate cash flows
substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three
country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The Optical discount and Malentille.com trademarks were
allocated to the “France” operating segment.

_6.2.6.2. Impairment testing methodology within groups of CGUs – Estimates for the calculation of value in_
_use_

Future cash flow projections are made on the basis of budgets and medium-term business plans approved
by the Board of Directors. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. In addition to the five-year
business plan established by the Group, the key assumptions are described below.

_6.2.6.3. Impairment testing results_

Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2020 revealed values in use in excess of the net asset
value of the France, Spain and Other countries CGUs. A 5.0% variation in adjusted EBITDA in 2020,
projected over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of approximately €49
million on the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €8 million on the Spain CGU and €2 million on the
Other countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of 31 July 2020. The
discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the France and Other countries CGUs are 8% and 1.5%
respectively. The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the Spain CGU are 8.5% and 1.5%
respectively.

Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of a 1 percentage point increase or decrease
in the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate used for testing as of 31 July 2020. It did not reveal any
impact on the loss recognised in respect of 2020 for the France, Spain or Other countries CGUs.

An impairment loss of €535 thousand was recorded as of 31 July 2019 on the Malentille.com trademark.

**_6.2.12. Cash and cash equivalents_**

The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank current accounts.

**_6.2.13. Share capital_**

As of 31 July 2020, the share capital amounted to €231,481,560.85, consisting of 433,486,069 fully paidup shares with a par value of €0.534 each, of which 415,449,754 common shares and 18,036,315 million
class D preference shares.

The Group’s common shares carry one vote; they give rights to dividends and the liquidation surplus, after
the rights attached to preference shares have been satisfied. Preference shares do not carry voting rights.

Class D preference shares have priority rights to all distributions of dividends, reserves or premiums until
full payment of the cumulative annual D priority dividend equal to 14% of the issue price (including bonus,
where applicable) and capitalised (for the portion of the dividend not paid in respect of prior years) annually
(at each reporting date) on the basis of a 360-day year and for the first time at the date of the first closing
following the date of issue of the class D preference shares.

Securities giving access to the capital:

16,166,000 AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants, including 6,596,000 tranche A AFFLELOU mezzanine
warrants conferring the right to subscribe for a maximum of 6,596,000 common shares of AFFLELOU SAS,
subject to any adjustments, and 9,520,000 tranche B AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants conferring the right
to subscribe for a maximum number of 9,520,000 common shares, subject to any adjustments.

No dividends were paid in respect of fiscal 2019 in 2020.

**_6.2.14. Employee benefits and similar_**

These benefits primarily cover retirement allowances in France.

Retirement allowances in France:

In France, the retirement allowance is a lump sum paid to employees when they retire. The amount
depends on the length of the individual’s service as of the date of retirement. It is determined on the basis
of collective and/or company agreements. The plan does not entitle employees to any allowance until they
reach retirement age (unvested). Retirement allowances are not linked to other standard pension benefits
such as pensions paid by Social Security or supplementary pension funds (ARRCO and AGIRC).

The assumptions used by the collecting body are as follows:

_6.2.16.3._ _Breakdown of the main sources of funding_

_6.2.16.3.1._ _High-yield bond debt of €415 million_

In October 2017, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of the two bonds on 3ABOD and LSF2,
in the amounts of €365 million and €75 million respectively, via the issuance of a new high-yield bond in a
total amount of €425 million on 3ABOD, and using cash and cash equivalents for the rest.

3ABOD issued €425 million in senior secured notes on 16 October 2017, with redemption at maturity on
15 October 2023. The bond is split into two tranches, one of €250 million at a fixed rate of 4% per annum
and the other of €175 million at a floating rate of Euribor +4.125%.

### The fixed-rate tranche is redeemable early under certain conditions, with penalties, until 1 April 2022. The floating-rate tranche may be redeemed early, without penalties, from 1 October 2019.
 This high-yield bond is subject to limited financial constraints: 
 The Group is not subject to compliance with financial ratios such as a leverage ratio (Net
Debt/EBITDA).
 The restrictions primarily relate to the realisation of transactions requiring additional
funding (incurring additional debt, making investments, etc.).

 In terms of collateral, the new bonds mainly benefit from the pledge in favour of their
holders of shares of the major Group companies, as well as the pledge of the Group’s main bank
accounts.

Under the terms of these bonds, the Group must report its quarterly condensed consolidated financial
statements and its audited annual consolidated financial statements within two and four months
respectively. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with all the conditions of these bonds
as of 31 July 2020. In June 2019, an amount of €10 million was redeemed early on a floating-rate tranche
of €175 million, bringing the total bond debt down to €415 million at the end of July 2019.

_6.2.16.3.2._ _Revolving credit facility (RCF) of €30 million_

The new bond was accompanied by the establishment of a €30 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This
is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements. It was established on 17
October 2017, with a term of 54 months from its inception. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate
combining Euribor and a margin, the margin being calculated on the basis of a leverage ratio. A non-use
commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU and 3ABOD
have been pledged as collateral, as have as the securities of potentially borrowing subsidiaries (3ABOD,
AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the RCF would
not generate penalties. Reporting obligations are the same as for bond lenders. The Group must also
certify, period-by-period, that the adjusted EBITDA of the prior 12 months is above €45 million. The most
recent such report was made for the quarter ended 30 April 2020. The facility was drawn in its full amount
in March, and was repaid on July 2020. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with terms
of this credit facility as of 31 July 2020.

_6.2.16.3.3._ _Government-guaranteed loan of €30 million_

In July 2020, the Group took out a €30 million government-guaranteed loan with its banking pool as part of
government support measures to address the COVID-19 outbreak. This loan, implemented in favour of
Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, is for a period of one year, and for the first year bears an interest rate of 0%. It
can be renewed for up to five years. For the period covered by the loan, the Group has undertaken not to
pay dividends or to distribute other substantial amounts to its shareholders, and to limit its investments,
particularly in respect of acquisitions. The Group considers to be in compliance with the terms and
conditions of this loan as of 31 July 2020.

On 17 July 2012, AFFLELOU issued 201,489,998 convertible bonds (OCA) at a price of 1 euro at par,
paying a fixed interest rate of 14%. As of 31 July 2020, the OCAs were valued at €279,890,297, after the
capitalisation of interest. Interest on the OCA is capitalised (the first capitalisation took place on 31 July
2013), and payment will be made either on the date of redemption or the date of conversion. The convertible
bonds mature on 17 July 2027. Conversion is possible at any time, on the basis of one share for one bond.
Early repayment is possible at the issuer’s initiative, subject to the conditions of the subordination
agreement, or, at the holder’s initiative, subject to compliance with the terms of the subordination
agreement, in case of change of control or IPO.

Equity component of convertible bonds:

The convertible bonds were recorded as debt and as equity. As of the date of issue, in accordance with
IAS 32, the debt component was measured by discounting the value of the contractual cash flows of the
convertible debt at an estimated market rate of 17% (see Note 4.17.2). The difference between the value
of the compound instrument and the debt component has been recorded in equity in “Other reserves” in
the initial amount of €66,274 thousand. As of 31 July 2020, the instrument was valued at €31,380 thousand
in equity.

The Group’s policy is to ensure that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or on
floating rate borrowings by contracting derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows
attributable to interest rate risk.

**_6.3.2._** **_The Group’s position in relation to currency risk_**

Apart from its purchasing activity with its supplier Okia, the Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange
rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases,
which are predominantly denominated is US dollars. To that end, the Group has established agreements
on purchasing conditions, on the basis of a fixed dollar/euro exchange rate, with Okia, its main supplier. A
derivative embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate
compared with the rate set in the contract to be split equally between the two parties.

It has also ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an
appreciation of the dollar against the euro.

**_6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk_**

The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held
by the Group. Generally speaking, the Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its
financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in delcredere
commissions.

**_6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk_**

Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically
assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million revolving credit
facility, undrawn as of 31 July 2020, to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed
bank overdraft and discounted trade receivables.

The valuation methods used for financial instruments as of 31 July 2020 are as follows:
 derivative financial instruments recorded in assets are valued at their market value;
 financial instruments recorded in liabilities, specifically other loans, are measured using other
valuation methods such as discounted cash flows, taking into account the Group’s credit risk and
interest rate conditions at the closing date.
The Group distinguishes three classes of financial instrument:
 Level 1: financial instruments measured using prices quoted in an active market;
 Level 2: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques based on
observable market parameters;
 Level 3: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques based on
unobservable parameters (parameters yielding valuations resulting from assumptions not based
on observable market transaction prices for the same instrument or observable market data
available as of the balance sheet date) or that are based only partially on such parameters.

 - Leases commitments for stores operated by the Group are now recognized in the balance sheet in
accordance with IFRS 16.

 - Sundry guarantees to third parties correspond mainly to rental obligations that the Group has kept with
some lessors on stores sold, in exchange for similar commitments received in the Group’s favour,
from franchisee buyers. These guarantees also include preliminary purchase contracts on 12 stores
owned by two franchisees.

 - Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of
acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital.
Secured loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its
capacity as guarantor to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of
100% of each application for financing, in some cases with a maximum portion of the overall envelope.

 - Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and
guarantees made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts
of the central payment structure.

In addition, the Group benefits from commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees:
under franchise agreements. Franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the
Group for the obligations and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure. These
guarantees are generally prorated at 30% of annual sales excluding VAT in France and Spain. However,
only guarantees and sureties related to franchisees’ specific debts (agreements, staggered payments,
vendor loans) are shown in the table of commitments received.

The sureties and bank guarantees received correspond to the bank guarantee obtained for the deferred
settlement of the proceeds from the sale of its stake in Optivisao to BRODHEIM.

**_6.6.2. Dependence of the Group on patents, licences and supply contracts_**

The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses or supply contracts.

**_6.6.3. Notifications, lawsuits and disputes_**

Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of
their business, including disputes with tax, social security or customs authorities.

The French Competition Authority investigation

 - On 27 May 2015, the French Competition Authority notified Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of grievances,
accusing it of “having colluded with providers of eye- and sunglass frames, from 2003 at the earliest
and until 2009, to fix retail prices and to impede the fixing of prices through free competition in violation
of the provisions of Article L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 paragraph 1 of the
TFEU”.

 - Alain Afflelou Franchiseur responded to the grievances laid out by the French Competition Authority on
27 July 2015, vigorously contesting them on all points. In July 2016, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received
a report from the French Competition Authority in response. The report rejected the arguments put
forward by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, but nevertheless narrowed the period of the alleged practices,
stating that the practices at issue were spread as regards Alain Afflelou Franchiseur between 25
February 2005 and 31 December 2009. The report also capped the potential penalty at approximately
€12.5 million.

 - The French Competition Authority issued a decision on the vertical agreement grievances on 24
February 2017. It decided to refer the issue back for further investigations. It is difficult to predict the
outcome of the new investigation, bearing in mind that it was deemed at this stage of the proceedings
that collusion had not been identified. The referral should result in a complementary notification. It is not
possible to assess the amount of any fine to which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur may be liable if the case
brought by the French Competition Authority is successful.

 - On 19 April 2019, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received notification of additional grievances in which no
grievance was filed against it. No response was therefore given to this notification.

 - On 2 March 2020, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received the additional report from the French Competition
Authority. Even though Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is still not concerned by the additional grievances, it
nevertheless issued a response to the Competition Authority on certain procedural arguments of interest
to it.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, which continues to believe itself to be in the right, intends to continue contesting
the French Competition Authority’s allegations vigorously. Accordingly, no provision for this litigation has
been recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

VAT Deductibility Notification

On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT
deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities
amounted to €1.5 million. Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group
decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal adjustment of €966 thousand. Nevertheless, the
Group referred the matter to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be

unfounded. The Group also called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its
acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1 million.

Deductibility of interest expense on convertible bonds

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards amounted to €65.8 million as of 31 July 2020.
Certain tax loss carryforwards are the subject of proposed tax adjustments issued by the tax authorities.
The main proposed adjustment was notified in December 2018 in respect of the income tax expense for
fiscal years ended 31 July 2013, 2014 and 2015. It concerns the deductibility of the 14% interest expense
on the convertible bonds issued in July 2012 as part of the Group’s acquisition by LBO, in an amount of
approximately €203 million. The French tax authorities reject the deductibility of the interest on these
convertible bonds on the grounds the issue of these bonds is equivalent to equity financing by major
shareholders, which constitutes an abuse of law. The Group, on the basis of the analysis carried out at this
stage by its legal and tax advisers, challenged this proposed adjustment in a response sent to the French
tax authorities in February 2019. It has consequently not changed its approach to tax loss carryforwards
as recorded in the balance sheet. Nevertheless, if the position of the French tax authorities were to prevail,
the possible resolution of this procedure would reduce the amount of tax loss carryforwards, approximately

### The Group has a Foundation in Spain, the purpose of which is to promote screening for visual impairments, especially among children. It also has an Endowment Fund in France, the purpose of which is to raise funds for work carried out directly or through associations. The Group also has a charity in France (“Loi 1901”), the purpose of which is to support work of all types in the areas of vision and hearing (improvement, protection and awareness raising). These three interests are not material, and are not consolidated by the Group.

**_8._** **_Subsequent events_**

### France, Spain and many other European countries have adopted new health protection measures since the end of October, to stem the increase in the number of Covid 19 cases encountered in recent weeks. It is too early to estimate the negative impact of this new lockdown on the Group's activity since the duration of the lockdown is still unclear. However, it should be noted that optical and audio stores are part of the list of stores authorized to open and receive the public under the sanitary conditions required by this situation. As of the date on which this report is established, i.e. approximately two weeks after the beginning of the lockdown, almost all stores are open and the drop in activity is limited.

**Statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements**


For the year ended 31 July 2019


_This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements of the_
_Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This_
_statutory auditors’ report includes information required by French law, such as information about the_
_appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents_
_provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance_
_with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._

To shareholders of Afflelou:

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your general meeting, we have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Afflelou for the year ended 31 July 2019. In our
opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of
the financial position of the Group as at 31 July 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then
ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**_Audit Framework_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report.

**_Independence_**

We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the
period from 1[ST] August 2018 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited
non-audit services referred to in the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**Emphasis of Matter**

Without modifying the conclusion expressed above, we draw your attention to the matters set out - in Note
6.6.3 “Notification, lawsuits and disputes” in respect of. the uncertainty related to the tax adjustments
received from the tax authorities concerning tax loss carryforwards

**Justification of Assessments**

In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following
assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Impairment tests
are performed on trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life in
accordance with the method described in Note 6.2.5 to the financial statements. We assessed the
appropriateness of the method implemented based on a range of estimates and examined the data and

F 68


-----

assumptions used by the group in performing these tests. On this basis, we assessed the
reasonableness of these estimates.

**Specific Verifications**

As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France
the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the President. We have
no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated**

**Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company
or to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**

Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.

As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (ode de commerce), our statutory
audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the
affairs of the Company.

As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control.

- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

F 69


-----

- Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This
assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory
auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation

- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the
consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial
statements.

financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2019 on 7 November 2019.

**_1.2._** **_General information on the Group_**

The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major
player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries
in Africa, Asia and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a
network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners.

The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue
generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their
purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of
products to franchisees, notably branded company products.

The Group owns a network of stores so as to (i) retain control over flagship stores located in strategic areas
and key geographies, (ii) test new business initiatives and identify best practices before applying them to
the franchisees, and (iii) manage the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at
the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group for
subsequent transfer to new franchisees.

Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com,
malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites.

**_2._** **_Highlights_**

**_2.1._** **_Change in the networks_**

The Group had 1,425 stores (1,342 optical stores and 83 audio stores) as of 31 July 2019, compared with
1,497 stores (1,408 optical stores and 89 audio stores) as of 31 July 2018. The reduction is attributable
chiefly to the decline in the number of Optical Discount stores in France, following an effort to streamline
the store base, the sale of the Optimil brand in Spain, and lastly, the termination of a master franchise
agreement for audio stores in Spain, resulting in the removal of 18 outlets from the audio portfolio.

The portfolio of 83 audio stores is complemented by 236 spaces in optical stores in France and Spain,
bringing the total of audio outlets to 319, compared with 298 as of 31 July 2018, representing a further
increase despite the termination of the master franchise agreement in Spain.

As of 31 July 2019, the Group operated in 19 countries, split into three zones: France with 957 points of
sale, Spain with 328 points of sale, and other countries representing 140 points of sale. The last year was
marked by fresh geographical expansion, including openings in Kuwait and Colombia.

-----

The portfolio of directly owned stores, located mainly in France and Spain, represented 162 optical stores
as of 31 July 2019, compared with 168 optical stores and 2 audio stores as of 31 July 2018.

**_2.2._** **_Change in the Group’s debt_**

In view of the cash generated during the year, the Group went ahead in June 2019 with the early redemption
of €10 million of the high-yield bond debt of €425 million issued by 3ABOD, reducing the outstanding
amount of this external debt to €415 million.

**_2.3._** **_Transactions on capital and securities giving access to the Group’s capital_**

On 4 September 2018, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of 3,252,343 convertible bonds
(OCA) (including capitalised interest) for €7,348 thousand.

On 31 July 2019, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of 16,851,625 convertible bonds (OCA)
in a total amount of €42,891 thousand and 711,895 bonds convertible into preference shares (OC ADPD)
in a total amount of €1,812 thousand.

These transactions were carried out as part of the restricted payment transactions authorised by the
documentation of high-yield bonds issued by 3ABOD in October 2017 in the amount of €425 million.

As a result of these transactions, 96,264,603 convertible bonds (OCA) issued by the Group for a capitalised
amount of €245,016 thousand remain outstanding (see note 6.2.15.3.3).

**_2.4._** **_Restructuring of the brand and retail banner portfolio_**

**Disposal of the Optimil discount banner in Spain**
Due to the disappointing performance of the Optimil discount banner in Spain and the difficulties in
implementing the various components of the franchisor offer at Optimil, the Group decided to sell this
banner. The sale of Optimil was completed in late October 2018. For the record, the Optimil activity was
classified as held for sale as of 31 July 2018.

**Disposal of the Group’s stake in Optivisao**
Following discussions in the second half of 2018, the Group sold its entire stake in Optivisao to its majority
shareholder, Brodheim, for €2 million in mid-January 2019. The sale is being settled in stages, with the
deferred payment covered by a bank payment guarantee.

**Termination of a master franchise agreement in the hearing aid sector in Spain**
Early in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, the Group terminated a master franchise agreement
with a hearing-aid company previously in charge of developing our brand in Spain.
This partner represented 18 hearing centres, or approximately €2.5 million in network sales per year. The
decision to terminate the master franchise agreement was taken on an amicable basis, without
compensation or penalty for either party.

**Digital activity**
The HAPPYVIEW brand, valued at €1,400 thousand and impaired in full, was discontinued during the year
in order to capitalise on the main banner, Alain Afflelou (see Note 6.2.1).

**_3._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation_**

**_3.1._** **Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2019**

The main changes in scope are the merger by way of absorption of Digital Eyewear by Alain Afflelou
Franchiseur, and its dissolution without liquidation with retroactive effect from the first day of the fiscal year,
i.e. 1 August 2018.

F 78


-----

As part of the disposal of the Optimil discount banner in Spain, Polus was sold in October 2018.

The Group acquired three Spanish companies (Cecimar Opticos, Paladio Vision and Feyla Opticos SL)
managing a total of five stores as part of its strategy of developing directly owned stores. These acquisitions
did not have a material impact on these consolidated financial statements, which are therefore comparable
with those of previous years. Over the year, Cecimar Opticos, Paladio Viso, Feyla Opticos and Opticas
Azahar were merged with Alain Afflelou Optico (AAO).

Lastly, the Group acquired AAOC Mag, comprising six stores, on 31 July 2019.

**_3.2._** **Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2018**

The Group acquired two Spanish companies (Selene Vision SL and Anta Socuellamos SL), each managing
a point of sale. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on these consolidated financial
statements, which are therefore comparable with those of previous years.

On 31 January 2018, the Group also acquired three French companies, two of which are already operated
by a franchisee under a lease management agreement (Académie Vision and Groupe Optique
Méditerranée) and one operating as a branch (Cathare Optique).

**_4._** **_Accounting policies_**

**_4.1._** **_Standards and rules applied_**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2019 were prepared in
accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting
Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under European Regulation 1606/2002 dated 19
July 2002. These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International
Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS
IC), as approved in the European Union, application of which was mandatory as of the year under review,
which are available on the website of the European Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/finance/companyreporting/index_en.htm).

The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in
preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2018, with the exception of new
standards, amendments and interpretations applicable in financial years beginning on or after 1 August
2018:

**_4.1.1. Standards, interpretations and amendments mandatory as of 1 August 2018:_**

  - **IFRS 15 and its amendments – Revenue from Contracts with Customers**
The Group early adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as of 1 August 2017.
The transition was made using the simplified retrospective method, without restatement of the
comparative information.

  - **IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments**
This standard replaces IAS 39, which was applied until 31 July 2018. The Group has adopted IFRS
9 retrospectively using the opportunity provided by the standard not to restate comparative data
except for hedge accounting applied prospectively. IFRS 9 did not have an impact on consolidated
equity as of 1 August 2018.

The Group’s analyses are presented below:

Classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities
The Group analysed financial assets within the context of the new IFRS 9 classification, based on the
Company’s management model and the contractual characteristics of the financial assets. The Group’s

F 79


-----

financial assets mainly include loans, receivables and deposits. These financial assets are not affected by
a change in valuation method and will continue to be measured using the amortised cost method.

Financial asset impairment model
The Group has opted for the simplified method of assessing the impairment of trade receivables. The
analysis of historical losses recorded on these receivables did not reveal any material amounts. The new
IFRS 9 impairment model (the “expected credit loss” model) did not have a material impact in comparison
with the Group’s previous impairment method.

Hedge accounting
The analysis did not identify any changes to the accounting method for hedging instruments used by the
Group.

On the basis of the work carried out, the application of this standard does not have a material impact. The
application of the following standards and amendments did not have a material impact on the Group’s
consolidated financial statements.

  - Amendments to IFRS 2 _Share-based Payment – Clarification of classification and_
measurement of share based payment transactions;

  - IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration;

  - Annual improvements, 2014-2016 cycle.

**4.1.2. Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved**
**or in the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet**
**mandatory as of 31 July 2019:**

  - **IFRS 16 Leases.**

On 13 January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard on leases, IFRS 16. This standard, which will replace
IAS 17 and its interpretations, will result in the recognition of most leases using a single accounting model
in the balance sheet, comprising a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying leased
asset and a lease liability representing the obligation to make payments (replacing the classification as
operating or finance leases for lessees).

The new standard, adopted by the European Union, is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019 and will therefore be applied by the Group from 1 August 2019.

Until 31 July 2019, the Group recognises its leases as operating leases and recognises rents on a straightline basis over the lease term in accordance with the provisions of IAS 17. Most of the Group’s leases
relate to real estate leases for the rental of commercial premises and, to a lesser extent, office space.

The Group is also an intermediary lessor because it has concluded sublease agreements with franchisees.
As a lessor, the Group currently records its leases as operating leases, recognising sublease income in
profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the sublease. Annual rental income amounts to around
€17 million.

The Group has elected to apply the modified retrospective transition approach offered by the standard.
As of 1 August 2019, the lease liability will be calculated by discounting the remaining rents at the Group’s
incremental borrowing rate at that date, taking into account the estimated remaining term of the various
leases. The rents taken into account are fixed or variable rents based on an index or an interest rate.
Variable rents do not give rise to the calculation of a lease liability.

On the transition date, right-of-use assets will be recognised in an amount equal to that of the lease liability
or, as permitted by the standard, by determining their carrying amount as if the standard had been applied
since the most recent of the following dates: inception of the lease, most recent renewal, or takeover of the
entity/activity carrying the lease within the meaning of IFRS 3, and then discounting it using the incremental
borrowing rate at the date of first application. This option will be used for the most material leases. The
choice of this transition approach means that prior period comparative information is not restated.

F 80


-----

The Group has also decided to make use of the exemptions permitted by the standard for short-term
contracts (less than 12 months) or for low-value assets.

The term of the leases will be the non-cancellable term plus the periods covered by an extension option
whose exercise is reasonably certain, and the periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise
is reasonably certain.

For the Group’s leases as lessor, the analysis carried out ahead of the transition caused the Group to
qualify them as finance leases. This qualification will result in the derecognition of the right-of-use asset
relating to the main lease and the recognition of the net investment in the sublease as a financial receivable.
Sublease agreements will result in the recognition of financial income corresponding to the effect of
discounting.

To meet the challenges of the transition, the Group has implemented an IFRS 16 project. The accounting
and legal teams have received training on the standard and the Group has acquired dedicated software
allowing it to monitor its contracts as lessee and as lessor, and to perform the calculations required to
record the restatement.

To date, the Group has finalised the collection of data, and is in the process of finalising the processing
necessary to estimate the impact of IFRS 16 on its results and financial position.

In Note 6.6.1, the Group discloses its future minimum lease payment commitments pursuant to IAS 17,
and payment commitments received in respect of subleases as of 31 July 2019.

The amount of these commitments is not representative of the lease liability that will be recognised as of
1 August 2019, and is significantly lower than the estimated amount of the liability under IFRS 16. Offbalance sheet commitments that are limited to the non-cancellable period of the contracts (IAS 17.35) and
which do not take into account extensions and/or the non-exercise of the cancellation options are
considered reasonably certain by the management, within the meaning of IFRS 16.

The provisional estimate of the impacts of the new standard shows additional debt of between €60 million
and €70 million and an increase in EBITDA of between €13 million and €17 million.

The Group has elected not to early apply the following standards and interpretations. The impact of the
application of the following amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently
being assessed.

  - **IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments;**

  - **Amendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment Provisions Providing for Negative Compensation;**

  - **Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures;**

  - **IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts;**

  - **Annual improvements, 2015-2017 cycle;**

  - **Amendments to IAS 19** **_Employee Benefits –_** **Plan Amendment, Curtailment or**
**Settlement;**

  - **Amendments to IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business;**

  - **Amendments to IAS 1 – change in the definition of “material”.**

**_4.2._** **_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the
takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control.

**_4.2.1._** **Consolidated entities**

The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 _Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, when it:_
 has power over the investee;
 is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and

F 81


-----

 has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining
economic benefits.

Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income
derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of
subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the
Group as a whole.

**_4.2.2._** **Associates**

The Group has no interests in joint ventures or associates.

**_4.2.3._** **Business combinations**

The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method:
 the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including
any earn-out payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earnout payment are recognised in profit or loss;
 the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by
goodwill, which is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position.

The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis
when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value
has been determined, adjustments are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur
within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and
circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognised directly
in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the
proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured:
 either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognised for the portion related to non-controlling
interests (full goodwill method);
 or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only
goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method).

Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating
income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are
measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognised either as adjustments to the
consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the
provisions of IFRS 3.

In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is
remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine
goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value
previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in
respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is reclassified to profit or loss.

**_4.3._** **_Basis of valuation, judgements and use of estimates_**

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS
require or permit the use of the fair value option.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the
value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and
valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of
the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including
trademarks) and the measurement of provisions.

F 82


-----

Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates on the basis of
regularly updated information. It is possible that future results could differ from such estimates. The main
assumptions and estimates made by the Group are described in specific sections of the notes to the
financial statements, and in particular in the following notes:

**Note** **Estimate** **Nature of estimate**

3.7 and Impairment testing of At the level of individual CGUs
6.2.3.3 intangible assets and property, Key assumptions used to determine value in use
plant and equipment (discount rate, perpetual growth rate, projected cash

flows)

3.12 and Inventories Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate
6.2.8 impairment

3.18.2 Deferred tax Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax
and assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and temporary
6.1.8.4 differences

**_4.4._** **_Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates_**

**_4.4.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency
at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange
differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognised in “Other financial income” or
“Other financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised directly in other
comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of the said gain or loss is also recognised in
other comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of
foreign exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in
Note 3.11. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the
transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at
the date the fair value was determined.

**_4.4.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies_**

The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their
respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity
operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
into euros as follows:
 items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate
prevailing on the balance sheet date;
 items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period,
as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations;
 differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance
sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the
period are recognised in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation”.

**_4.5._** **_Intangible assets excluding goodwill_**

An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and
controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An
intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or
contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis
over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually within the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which they
belong.

Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria:

F 83

|Note|Estimate|Nature of estimate|
|---|---|---|
|3.7 and 6.2.3.3|Impairment testing of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment|At the level of individual CGUs Key assumptions used to determine value in use (discount rate, perpetual growth rate, projected cash flows)|
|3.12 and 6.2.8|Inventories|Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate impairment|
|3.18.2 and 6.1.8.4|Deferred tax|Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences|


-----

 Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition;
 Prospective long-term profitability.

Licences and software have useful lives of between one and four years, and are amortised over the relevant
period.

Lastly, leasehold rights are not amortised, but are tested for impairment (Note 3.7).

**_4.6._** **_Property, plant and equipment_**

**_4.6.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial
consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the alternative
method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant and equipment.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

**_4.6.2. Depreciation_**

The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment
held:

Property, plant and equipment Useful life Depreciation method

Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line
Industrial machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Straight line
Technical equipment under finance leases 3 to 10 years Straight line
Other property, plant and equipment 5 years Straight line

**_4.7._** **_Impairment of non-current assets (IAS 36)_**

Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items
are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also
performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment, CGUs or groups of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from
unfavourable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used as
of the acquisition date.

Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of
CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset, CGU or group of CGUs is the
greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on
projections of expected future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalisation
in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair
value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the
recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment
loss is recognised against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs,
the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other nonrecurring operating items” in the income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may
be reversed later if the recoverable amount later comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses
recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.

F 84

|Property, plant and equipment|Useful life|Depreciation method|
|---|---|---|
|Buildings Industrial machinery and equipment Technical equipment under finance leases Other property, plant and equipment|10 to 20 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 10 years 5 years|Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line|


-----

On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another
method is deemed more pertinent.

**_4.8._** **_Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale_**

Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly
likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use.

Such assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or
fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated
first to goodwill and then to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment
losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well
as gains and losses on subsequent measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer
amortised or depreciated.

Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that:
 represents a separate activity or geographical area,
 is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area,
 is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.

The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an
earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other
comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at
the beginning of the comparative period.

**_4.9._** **_Leases_**

In the course of its various business activities, the Group uses assets made available or makes assets
available under lease arrangements. Such leases are analysed on the basis of the situations and indicators
set out in IAS 17 Leases to determine whether they are operating or finance leases.

 As lessee

    - Finance leases: on initial recognition, assets held under finance leases are recognised as property,
plant and equipment with offsetting debt. The asset is recognised at the fair value of the leased
asset at the date of inception of the contract, or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease
payments. It is depreciated over the term of the contract.

    - Operating leases: payments made under operating leases (other than the costs of services such
as insurance and maintenance) are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.
 As lessor
All lease management contracts signed by the Group with its franchisees are operating leases.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the fixed terms of commercial leases.

**_4.10._** **_Other financial assets and liabilities_**

Pursuant to IAS 39, financial assets are classified in one of four categories:
 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
 loans and receivables;
 held-to-maturity investments;
 available-for-sale financial assets.

F 85


-----

The classification determines the accounting treatment of the assets in question. It is determined by the
Group on the date of initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for as of the transaction date, when the Group
undertakes to purchase or sell assets. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the
cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred.

1. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets whose payments are fixed or determinable,
which are not traded in an active market and which are not held for trading or available for sale. Such
assets are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method. For short-term receivables with no stated interest rate, the fair value and amortised cost are
equivalent to the amount of the original invoice unless the effective interest rate has a significant impact.
Such assets are tested for impairment when there is an indication of loss of value. Impairment is recognised
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. This category consists of vendor loans
granted to franchisees who acquire stores from the Group and deposits paid to Group lessors. For vendor
loans, amortised cost is equal to the face value, in the absence of significant costs associated with their
establishment. Vendor loans can be repaid early as desired by franchisees (using either bank refinancing
or their own resources). Receivables related to investments, security deposits, current loans and
receivables, and trade receivables are also included in this category. They are classified as current or noncurrent “Other financial assets” and in “Trade receivables”.

2. Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are not included in the above
categories. They are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the sale is finalised. However, when an available-for-sale financial asset
shows objective evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss is recognised in profit or loss. For listed
securities, fair value corresponds to market prices. For unlisted securities, it is determined by reference to
recent transactions or using valuation techniques based on reliable and observable market data.

**_4.11._** **_Derivatives_**

In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet in other
current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and
carried at fair value as of the transaction date. The change in the fair value of derivative instruments is
always recognised in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied.

Hedge accounting is only applied if the following conditions are met:
 a hedging relationship is clearly identified, formalised and documented from the date of its
inception;
 the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated prospectively and retrospectively.
Confidence in the results obtained must be within a range of 80% to 125%.

Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair
value. The effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in
profit or loss.

**_4.12._** **_Inventories_**

Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens
products (held as part of the Group’s central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly owned
stores (consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products). Inventories in
the balance sheet may under certain circumstances include stores held temporarily as property dealer.

Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any
unsold items so as to align them with their realisable values.

Inventories held in stores are subject to impairment, in accordance with the following rules:
 20% for products of more than one year,
 40% for products of more than two years,

F 86


-----

 80% for products of more than three years,
 100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer
marketed.

**4.13.** **_Other current assets and liabilities_**

**_4.13.1. Trade receivables and other current assets_**

Trade receivables are carried at amortised cost. Receivables relating to the central payment and
purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. An impairment is recognised when the
outstanding carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Other current assets chiefly include
receivables in respect of the central payment activity, including franchisees’ payments for their purchases
from the referenced suppliers, as well as the discounts granted by such suppliers to franchisees, to be
passed on to franchisees. An impairment is recognised when the outstanding carrying amount exceeds the
recoverable amount.

**_4.13.2._** **Trade payables and other current liabilities**

Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at
amortised cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity,
including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers,
to be passed on to franchisees.

**_4.14._** **_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of
investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held in order to meet shortterm cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of
cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in the balance sheet less
bank overdrafts.

**_4.15._** **_Provisions and contingent liabilities_**

A contingent liability is:
 a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity;
or
 a present obligation arising from past events but which is not recognised because:
      - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; or
      - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

A provision is recognised when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement
of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming
amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are
subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant
retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including
rental expenses, taxes and related expenses), less any sublease income.

**_4.16._** **_Employee benefits and similar_**

Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types
of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to
make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does
not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the
current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for
the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes.

F 87


-----

Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis
of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives
rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final
obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations
vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. The
biggest such plans and termination payments are subject to an actuarial valuation by independent actuaries
every year; valuations are performed at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account
the level of future compensation, the probable length of employment, life expectancy and staff turnover.

Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated
results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined
benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognised in income from ordinary activities. Reductions,
settlements and past service costs are recognised in income from ordinary activities. The provision
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair
value of plan assets.

**4.17.** **_Borrowings_**

**_4.17.1. Loans and other financial liabilities_**

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognised at fair value less
transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

The effective interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying
amount of a financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest
date to re-pricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums
and/or discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of
a financial liability.

Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at
amortised cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk.
Hedging relationships are described in Note 3.10 “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the
fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are
expensed as incurred.

**_4.17.2._** **Compound instruments**

Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the
case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognised in shareholders’
equity and in loans and financial liabilities, on the basis of their respective weighting, in accordance with
IAS 32 _Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their_
measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption),
discounted at the market rate (taking into account the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination)
of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or
redeemable for shares. The portion recognised in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount
of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected
disbursements over the term of the loan in order to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan
recorded in borrowings.

**4.18.** **_Taxes_**

**_4.18.1. Current taxes_**

F 88


-----

The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its
income is taxable. The Group recognises the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée
_des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on_
the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**_4.18.2._** **Deferred tax**

### In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognised in profit or loss for the year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also recognised directly in equity.
 A deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary difference is reversed, or if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
 Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carry-forwards and tax credits are limited to the estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end of the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.

**_4.19._** **_Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current_**

For the majority of the Group’s activities, it has been decided that the criterion for this classification is the
date of liquidation of the asset or settlement of the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current
if more than 12 months.

**_4.20._** **_Revenue recognition_**

The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services:
 Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged
to franchisees. Revenue is recognised as and when control of the service is transferred over the
duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognised on the date on which
the underlying sale occurs.
 Network sales revenues include sales to franchisees of lenses, contact lenses and frames through
the Group’s central purchasing structure. These sales of products trademarked ALAIN AFFLELOU
are recognised on the date of transfer of control to exclusive distributors and franchisees. Referral,
delcredere and distribution commissions to referenced suppliers and finder’s fees are accounted
for as and when sales are made.
 Revenues from directly owned stores: retail sales of directly owned stores operating under the
“ALAIN AFFLELOU” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners, and sales resulting from the “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” hearing aid activity. Revenue is recognised on the date of transfer of
control.
The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted.

**_4.21._** **_Cost of purchases_**

The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely:
 The purchasing cost of eyeglass frames
 The purchasing cost of eyeglass lenses
 The purchasing cost of contact lenses
 The purchasing cost of accessories and other goods
 Change in inventories of all of the above purchases

F 89


-----

 The cost of communication purchases

**_4.22._** **_Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items_**

Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the
Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To
facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items
for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other non-current operating items”. Other operating income
and expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include:
 restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures;
 impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognised primarily following impairment testing of
cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill;
 capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisitions or
disposals);
 major disputes.
These items, excluded from operating income due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be
considered as part of operating income from the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events
that are both limited in scope and very unusual.

**_4.23._** **_Operating profit_**

Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether
such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant
items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”.

**5.** **_Segment reporting_**

**_5.1._** **_Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments_**

The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography into three areas, namely “France”, “Spain”
and “Other countries”.

The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central purchasing unit, a
central listing and payment unit, and directly owned stores. The “France” segment also includes an audio
business operated under a master franchise agreement. The Group has replicated the established
organisation of its French operations in Spain, and aims ultimately to repeat this process in the “Other
countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment notably includes Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal.
This segment includes a central purchasing unit in Belgium, and has only a few directly owned stores in
Portugal.

The segment reporting presented here was prepared on the basis of the internal reporting data reviewed
by the Chairman and CEO, the Group’s “chief operating decision maker” within the meaning of IFRS 8,
who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them.

Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business
performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial
indicators used to measure segment performance are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. These two
indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note, and are reconciled
with operating income.

Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in
“Other countries”:
 The trading company specialising in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB)
 The Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds international supplier contracts for the
entire Group.

F 90


-----

The trading activity (AAB) and international supplier contract activity (AAI) impact the entire Group. The
geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the
“Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the
results of these trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following
allocation key:
 The result of the AAB trading branch in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating
country of franchisees’ purchases in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames
delivered during the year;
 Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognised as
revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in
proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers.

The chief operating decision maker does not review a geographical breakdown of information regarding
the Group’s assets and liabilities.

No customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.

The information on the Group’s various activities and services is provided in Note 1.2, Note 3.20 on revenue
recognition and Note 6.1.1 on revenue by activity.

consolidated financial statements before the impact of shareholders’ management fees.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income from ordinary activities as presented in the Group’s
consolidated financial statements, less depreciation and amortisation of property, plant and equipment,
and intangible assets, changes in provisions for trade receivables and inventories, and shareholders’
management fees.

**_5.3._** **_Discontinued operations_**

Management undertook a plan to dispose of the entire Optimil business during fiscal 2018 as part of a
strategic decision to refocus the Group on its key areas of expertise (see highlights). This transaction was
finalised in October 2018. In addition, as of 31 July 2018, the Optivisao securities were classified as assets
held for sale with no impact on the income statement. The Group sold its stake in the year ended 31 July
2019 (see highlights). These two transactions were classified as assets held for sale in fiscal 2018.

Deferred tax assets representing tax losses are not recognised in the following situations:
 When they relate to companies outside the tax group that have been loss-making for several years
and for which a return to profit is not deemed likely in the near future.
 When they relate to tax losses that are unlikely to be used in view of the earnings outlooks of the
companies in question and the information available as of the date of the financial statements.

As of the balance sheet date, the stock of unrecognised tax losses was as follows:

31/07/2019 31/07/2018

(in thousands of euros) Tax Amount Tax Amount

losses of tax losses of tax

French companies:

Tax losses of companies belonging to a tax group 21,127 5,457

Tax losses generated prior to entry into the tax group 4,727 1,627 5,891 2,028

Tax losses excluding the tax group 9,376 2,344 5,229 1,307

Foreign companies:

Tax losses of the Portuguese company 3,287 690 2,613 549

Tax losses of companies in other countries 670 111 869 168

**Total** **18,060** **4,772** **35,730** **9,509**

The losses of the French tax group including AFFLELOU, AAFR, 3ABOD, 3ABOE, OPTICAL FINANCE,
LOA and LSFA can be carried forward for an unlimited period. Losses before the entry into the tax group
of L’Opticien Afflelou (LOA) can be carried forward for an unlimited period on an individual basis. Losses
before the entry into the tax group of F2L, ACADEMIE VISION, GROUPE OPTICAL MEDITERANEE and
CATHARE OPTIQUE can be carried forward for an unlimited time on an individual basis.

For French companies, the amount of tax losses offset in a given fiscal year may not exceed €1 million,
plus 50% of the amount of the profit against which deficits are offset above this threshold. Losses can only
be carried back to the year prior to that in respect of which the tax loss is recognised, within a limit of €1
million.

In Portugal, losses generated by AAP between 2010 and 2013 must be used within five years. Losses
generated since 2014 must be used within 12 years. In addition, effective 1 January 2012, the amount of
losses that may be offset in a given fiscal year is capped at 75% of taxable income for that year.

The tax losses of Spanish companies can be carried forward for a period of no more than 18 years. The
absorption of Cecimar Opticos, Paladio Vision, Feyla Opticos SL and Opticas Azahar SL by AAO resulted
in the loss of unused tax losses.

**_6.1.9. Earnings per share_**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares less
the weighted average number of shares held by consolidated companies.

Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares defined above, plus the
weighted average number of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive shares are: shares
granted in connection with convertible bonds issued at the time of the Group’s refinancing on 17 July 2012,
which include bonds convertible into shares (OCA), i.e. potentially 96,264,603 shares; and shares granted
in connection with class A mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 6,596,000 shares, and class B
mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 9,520,000 shares.

The instruments issued by the Group did not have any dilutive effect in fiscal 2018 or 2019. The maximum
number of potential dilutive shares in future years is 112.380.603 shares.

**6.2.** **_Notes to the balance sheet_**

**_6.2.1. Trademarks_**

As of 31 July 2019, the trademarks were valued at a total of €657,065 thousand, compared with €657,600
thousand as of 31 July 2018.

The Group was the subject of two successive acquisitions following its delisting in 2007, with a final
acquisition on 17 July 2012 by Lion Seneca Lux 2 (LSL2) via its LSF1 holding company subsidiary (now
known as AFFLELOU). This resulted in the valuation of the Alain Afflelou trademark at €650 million as part
of the accounting for the takeover pursuant to IFRS 3. The Group has revised its e-commerce strategy,
aiming to capitalise on the main branded website, using the skills and experience acquired from
malentille.com and happyview.fr. Under this strategy, the HappyView brand has been abandoned in favour
of Alain Afflelou and the branded website. The Malentille.com brand has been impaired in the amount of
the difference between its historical value and the revenue achieved over the year.

Acquisitions of intangible assets in fiscal 2019 totalled €5,916 thousand, breaking down as €2,451
thousand in leasehold rights and €2,676 thousand in concessions and patents invested in France and
Spain. The “Leasehold rights – Franchisor” line includes the leasehold to the store on the Champs Elysées,
75008 Paris, held by AAFR, as well as leasehold rights held directly by AAE and AAP. Other movements
mainly reflect the capitalisation of intangible assets in progress for AAFR in the amount of €649 thousand
and AAI in the amount of €58 thousand in the year.

**_6.2.5._** **_Impairment testing of non-current intangible assets_**

_6.2.5.1. Nature of impairment testing_

The Group first tests lease and similar rights on directly owned stores, then trademarks and ultimately
goodwill. Directly owned stores are a first-level asset CGU; operating segments are a goodwill CGU.

Impairment testing of leasehold rights is performed on a store-by-store basis, based on the estimated
market value. When in the course of negotiations the Group has indicative offers, it uses them to measure
the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the probable selling price, calculated
on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each store, in line with potential market
conditions.

In 2016, the original goodwill was allocated, following the change in the Group’s internal reporting structure,
to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to
adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not generate on its own account cash flows
substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three
country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The OPTICAL DISCOUNT and Malentille.com trademarks
and goodwill have been allocated to the “France” operating segment.

_6.2.5.2. Impairment testing methodology – Estimates for the calculation of value in use_

Future cash flow projections are made on the basis of budgets and medium-term business plans approved
by the Board of Directors. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. In addition to the five-year
business plan established by the Group, the key assumptions used as of 31 July 2019 and 31 July 2018
are a perpetual growth rate of 1.5% and a discount rate of 7.5% (except for the Spain CGU, for which a
discount rate of 8% was used).

_6.2.5.3. Impairment testing results_

_6.2.5.3.1._ Impairment testing of leasehold rights in 2018 and 2019
The leasehold rights held by LOA and AAO were tested as of 31 July 2018 and 2019. Impairment losses
were recognised on these assets in the amounts of €915 thousand as of 31 July 2019 and €4,296 thousand
as of 31 July 2018, with reversals in the amounts of €3,988 thousand as of 31 July 2019 and €2,053
thousand as of 31 July 2018.

_6.2.5.3.2._ Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2019
Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2019 revealed values in use in excess of the net asset
value of the France, Spain and Other countries CGUs. An impairment loss of €535 thousand was recorded
as of 31 July 2019 on the Malentille.com trademark. A 5.0% variation in adjusted EBITDA in 2019, projected
over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of approximately €52 million on
the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €8 million of the Spain CGU and €2 million of the Other
countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of 31 July 2019. The discount
rates and the perpetual growth rates for France and Other countries CGUs are 7.5% and 1.5% respectively.
The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for Spain CGUs are 8% and 1.5% respectively.
Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of a 1 percentage point increase or decrease

in the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate used for the tests. It did not reveal any impact on the loss
recognised in respect of 2019 for the France, Spain or Other countries CGUs.

**_6.2.11. Cash and cash equivalents_**

### The Group’s cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of bank current accounts.

**_6.2.12. Share capital_**

As of 31 July 2019, the share capital amounted to €233,531,553.20, consisting of 437,325,006 fully paidup shares with a par value of 0.534 euro each, of which 418,937,316 common shares, breaking down as
16,592,177 class D preference shares and 1,795,513 million class E preference shares. The Group’s
common shares carry one vote; they give rights to dividends and the liquidation surplus, after the rights
attached to preference shares have been satisfied. Preference shares do not carry voting rights.

Class D preference shares have priority rights to all distributions of dividends, reserves or premiums until
full payment of the cumulative annual D priority dividend equal to 14% of the issue price (including bonus,
where applicable) and capitalised (for the portion of the dividend not paid in respect of prior years) annually
(at each reporting date) on the basis of a 360-day year and for the first time at the date of the first closing
following the date of issue of the class D preference shares.

Each class E preference share carries 4.127 voting rights and a financial right and a corresponding right in
the event of liquidation or exit, within the limits of (i) Articles 9.6, 9.7 and 9.8 of the Articles of Incorporation
and (ii) the rules referred to in Schedule 2 of the Articles of Incorporation, financial rights and rights in the
event of liquidation or exit attached to 4.127 common shares.

Securities giving access to the capital:
16,166,000 AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants, including 6,596,000 tranche A AFFLELOU mezzanine
warrants conferring the right to subscribe for a maximum of 6,596,000 common shares of AFFLELOU SAS,
subject to any adjustments, and 9,520,000 tranche B AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants conferring the right
to subscribe for a maximum number of 9,520,000 common shares, subject to any adjustments.

No dividends were paid in respect of fiscal 2018 in 2019.

**_6.2.13. Employee benefits and similar_**

These benefits primarily cover retirement allowances in France.

Retirement allowances in France

In France, the retirement allowance is a lump sum paid to employees when they retire. The amount
depends on the length of the individual’s service as of the date of retirement. It is determined on the basis
of collective and/or company agreements. The plan does not entitle employees to any allowance until they
reach retirement age (unvested). Retirement allowances are not linked to other standard pension benefits
such as pensions paid by Social Security or supplementary pension funds (ARRCO and AGIRC).

The assumptions used by the collecting body are as follows:
 mortality table: TF00-02,
 rules governing retirement benefits: from the national collective agreement for eyewear retail,
 retirement age: 63 years for the Manager category, 62 years for the Technician category
(franchisor) and 63 years for the Technicians category (directly owned stores);
 62 years for the Worker/Employee category,
 type of retirement: voluntary departure,

Assumptions 31/07/2019 31/07/2018

Rate of employers’ contributions (franchisor) 46.7% 52.0%

Rate of employers’ contributions (directly owned stores) 36.0% 47.0%

_6.2.15.3._ _Breakdown of the main sources of funding_

_6.2.15.3.1._ _High-yield bond debt of €415 million_

In October 2017, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of the two bonds on 3ABOD and LSF2,
in the amounts of €365 million and €75 million respectively, via the issuance of a new high-yield bond in a
total amount of €425 million on 3ABOD, and using cash and cash equivalents for the rest. 3ABOD issued
€425 million in senior secured notes on 16 October 2017, with redemption at maturity on 15 October 2023.
The bond is split into two tranches, one of €250 million at a fixed rate of 4% per annum and the other of
€175 million at a floating rate of Euribor +4.125%. The fixed-rate tranche is redeemable early under certain
conditions, with penalties, until 1 April 2022. The floating-rate tranche may be redeemed early, without
penalties, from 1 October 2019.

This high-yield bond is subject to limited financial constraints:
 The Group is not subject to compliance with financial ratios such as a leverage ratio (Net
Debt/EBITDA).
 The restrictions primarily relate to the realisation of transactions requiring additional
funding (incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, etc.).
 In terms of collateral, the new bonds mainly benefit from the pledge in favour of their
holders of shares of the major Group companies, as well as the pledge of the Group’s main bank
accounts.

Under the terms of these bonds, the Group must report its quarterly condensed consolidated financial
statements and its annual audited consolidated financial statements within two and four months
respectively. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with all the conditions of these bonds
as of 31 July 2019. In June 2019, an amount of €10 million was redeemed early on a floating-rate tranche
of €175 million, bringing the total bond debt down to €415 million at the end of July 2019.

_6.2.15.3.2._ _Revolving credit facility of €30 million_

The new bond was accompanied by the establishment of a €30 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This
is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements. It was established on 17
October 2017, with a term of 54 months from its inception. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate
combining Euribor and a margin, the margin being calculated on the basis of a leverage ratio. A non-use
commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU, LSF2 and
3ABOD have been pledged as collateral, as have the securities of potentially borrowing subsidiaries
(3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the

RCF would not generate penalties. This credit facility has been undrawn since its establishment. Reporting
obligations are the same as for bond lenders. The Group must also certify, period-by-period, that the
adjusted EBITDA of the prior 12 months is above €45 million. The most recent such report was made for
the quarter ended 30 April 2019. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with the terms of
this credit facility as of 31 July 2019.

Total 206,132 (42,303) 34,868 198,697

On 17 July 2012, AFFLELOU issued 201,489,998 convertible bonds (OCA) at a price of 1 euro at par,
paying a fixed interest rate of 14%. As of 31 July 2019, the OCA were valued at €245,016,309, after the
capitalisation of interest. Interest on the OCA is capitalised (the first capitalisation took place on 31 July
2013), and payment will be made either on the date of redemption or the date of conversion. The convertible
bonds mature on 17 July 2027. Conversion is possible at any time, on the basis of one share for one bond.
Early repayment is possible at the issuer’s initiative, subject to the conditions of the subordination
agreement, or, at the holder’s initiative, subject to compliance with the terms of the subordination
agreement, in case of change of control or IPO. On 17 July 2012, AFFLELOU issued 1,820,000 bonds
convertible into class R preference shares (OC ADP) at a price of 1 euro at par, paying a fixed interest rate
of 14%. On 31 July 2019, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of the balance of the bonds
convertible into preference shares (OC ADPD).

Equity component of convertible bonds:
The convertible bonds were recorded as debt and as equity. As of the date of issue, in accordance with
IAS 32, the debt component was measured by discounting the value of the contractual cash flows of the
convertible debt at an estimated market rate of 17% (see Note 3.17.2). The difference between the value
of the compound instrument and the debt component has been recorded in equity in “Other reserves” in
the initial amount of €66,274 thousand. As of 31 July 2019, the instrument was valued at €31,380 thousand
in equity. The net impact on shareholders’ equity of the repayment of convertible bonds during the period
amounted to €7,230 thousand.

Following the issuance of the €425 million bond, the Group established an interest rate hedge covering the
full floating rate tranche of €165 million as of 31 July 2019. It thus acquired options to cap the floating rate
indexed to 3M Euribor at 0% over the 2018 and 2019 calendar years. In addition, at the end of 2018, the
Group established two new optional hedges of €50 million each to cap the floating rate indexed to 3M
Euribor at 0.25% over the 2020 calendar year, and 0.50% over the 2020 and 2021 calendar years.

**_6.3._** **_Notes on risk exposure_**

As of 31 July 2019, exposure to various market risks can be analysed as follows:

**_6.3.1._** **_The Group’s position in relation to interest rate risk_**

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as of 31 July 2019 is immaterial.
The Group’s policy is to ensure that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or on
floating rate borrowings by contracting derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows
attributable to interest rate risk.

**_6.3.2._** **_The Group’s position in relation to currency risk_**

The Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the
euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases, which are predominantly denominated is US
dollars. To address this risk, the Group has:
 established agreements on purchasing conditions with some of its suppliers, on the basis of a fixed
dollar/euro exchange rate, and more specifically with Okia, its main supplier, with which a derivative
embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate
compared with the rate set in the contract to be shared equally between the two parties, and
 ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an
appreciation of the dollar against the euro.

**_6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk_**

The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held
by the Group. Generally speaking, the Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its
financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in delcredere
commissions.

**_6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk_**

Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically
assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million undrawn revolving
credit facility to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed bank overdraft and
discounted trade receivables.

The valuation methods used for financial instruments as of 31 July 2019 are as follows:
 derivative financial instruments recorded in assets are valued at their market value;
 financial instruments recorded in liabilities, specifically other loans, are measured using other
valuation methods such as discounted cash flows, taking into account the Group’s credit risk and
interest rate conditions at the closing date.
The Group distinguishes three classes of financial instrument:
 Level 1: financial instruments measured using prices quoted in an active market;
 Level 2: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques
based on observable market parameters;
 Level 3: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques based on
unobservable parameters (parameters yielding valuations resulting from assumptions not based
on observable market transaction prices for the same instrument or observable market data
available as of the balance sheet date) or that are based only partially on such parameters.
The Group’s medium-term external borrowings (high-yield bonds traded on the Irish Stock Exchange)
belong to the Level 1 category; all other financial instruments belong to the Level 3 category.
The tables above provide the following information for the various classes of financial instrument:

- in the first column: the carrying amount

- in the second column: fair value pursuant to IFRS 7.25

- in the third column: the IAS 39 category under which they are valued pursuant to IFRS 7.8.

Lease payments relate to the buildings occupied by the Group, either as offices or commercial premises
(opticians), with marginal lease payments on operating leases corresponding primarily to leased computer
hardware without purchase commitments.

Sundry guarantees to third parties correspond to rental obligations that the Group has kept with some
lessors on stores sold, in exchange for similar commitments received in the Group’s favour, from franchisee
buyers. Moreover, these guarantees varied considerably during the past year, following the signing by the
Group of preliminary purchase contracts on 13 stores from two franchisees, and at the same time were
reduced as a result of the lifting of a preliminary purchase contract relating to the portfolio of 6 stores of
AAOC Mag.

Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of
acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital. Secured
loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its capacity as guarantor
to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of 100% of each application
for financing, up to a maximum portion usually set at approximately 30%.

Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and guarantees
made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts of the central
payment structure.

 Measurement of commitments: property lease commitments are measured on the basis of the
period remaining until the end of the lease (without possibility of early release), as are other leases,
which relate chiefly to computer hardware. It is also noted that commitments in respect of finance
leases and operating leases relating primarily to the assets of stores (furniture, optical equipment,
etc.) are not included in the Group’s debt as reported in the table above if they do not include
specific commitments.

 Commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees: under franchise agreements,
franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the Group for the obligations
and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure. These guarantees are generally
prorated at 30% of annual sales excluding VAT in France and Spain; only guarantees and sureties
related to franchisees’ specific debts (agreements, staggered payments, vendor loans) are shown
in the table of commitments received.

The sureties and bank guarantees received correspond to the bank guarantee obtained for the deferred
settlement of the proceeds from the sale of its stake in Optivisao to BRODHEIM.

**_6.6.2. Dependence of the Group on patents, licences and supply contracts_**

The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses or supply contracts.

**_6.6.3. Notification, lawsuits and disputes_**

Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of
their business, including disputes with tax, social security or customs authorities.

On 27 May 2015, the French Competition Authority notified Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of grievances,
accusing it of “having colluded with providers of eye- and sunglass frames, from 2003 at the latest and until
2009, to fix retail prices and to impede the fixing of prices through free competition in violation of the
provisions of Article L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 paragraph 1 of the TFEU”.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur responded to the grievances laid out by the French Competition Authority on 27
July 2015, vigorously contesting them on all points. In July 2016, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received a
report from the French Competition Authority in response. The report rejects the arguments put forward by
Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, but nevertheless narrows the period of the alleged practices, stating that the
practices at issue were spread as regards Alain Afflelou Franchiseur between 25 February 2005 and 31
December 2009. The report also caps the potential penalty at approximately €12.5 million.

The French Competition Authority issued a decision on the vertical agreement grievances on 24 February
2017. It decided to refer the issue back for further investigations. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the
new investigation, bearing in mind that it was deemed at this stage of the proceedings that collusion had
not been identified. The referral should result in a complementary notification. It is not possible to assess
the amount of any fine to which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur may be liable if the case brought by the French
Competition Authority is successful.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, which continues to believe itself to be in the right, intends to continue contesting
the French Competition Authority’s allegations vigorously. Accordingly, no provision for this litigation has
been recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT
deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities
amounted to €1.5 million.

Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the Group decided to pay the sum
corresponding to the principal adjustment of €966 thousand. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter
to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The Group also
called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which
are capped at €1 million.

No litigation involving companies belonging to the Group is underway that, in the opinion of legal experts,
poses a risk to the Group’s normal and foreseeable operations or planned development. The Group does
not believe there to be any other disputes involving significant prospective risks liable to affect its assets,
results or financial condition for which provisions had not been set aside as of the year-end. No dispute,
taken individually, is significant at either the individual company or Afflelou Group level. The Group is not
aware of any other litigation or arbitration liable to have or having had in the recent past a significant impact
on the Afflelou Group’s financial position, business or earnings.

Deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards total €64 million as of 31 July 2019. Certain tax
loss carryforwards are the subject of proposed tax adjustments issued by the tax authorities. The main
proposed adjustment was notified in December 2018 in respect of the income tax expense for fiscal years
ended 31 July 2013, 2014 and 2015. It concerns the deductibility of the 14% interest expense on the
convertible bonds issued in July 2012 as part of the Group’s acquisition by LBO, in an amount of
approximately €202 million. The French tax authorities reject the deductibility of the interest on these
convertible bonds on the grounds that the issue of these bonds is equivalent to equity financing by major
shareholders, which constitutes an abuse of law. The Group, on the basis of the analysis carried out at this
stage by our legal and tax advisers, challenged this proposed adjustment in a response sent to the French
tax authorities in February 2019. It has consequently not changed its approach to tax loss carryforwards
as recorded in the balance sheet. Nevertheless, if the position of the French tax authorities prevails, the
possible resolution of this procedure would reduce the amount of tax loss carryforwards (approximately
€51 million in deferred tax assets according to initial estimates), and could result in payment of income
taxes for the years subject to adjustments. In this context, the maximum estimated outflow would be €10
million.

**Statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements**

For the year ended 31 July 2018

_This is a translation into English of the statutory auditors’ report on the financial statements of the_
_Company issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This_
_statutory auditors’ report includes information required by French law, such as information about the_
_appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents_
_provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance_
_with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France._

To annual general meeting of Afflelou:

**Opinion**

In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your sole shareholder, we have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Afflelou for the year ended 31 July 2018.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities
and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 July 2018 and of the results of its operations for the
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union.

**Basis for Opinion**

**_Audit Framework_**
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that
the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the "Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for
the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements" section of our report.

**_Independence_**
We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the
period from 1[ST] August 2017 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited
non-audit services referred to in the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

**Emphasis of Matter**
We draw attention to the following matter described in Note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements
that describes the impact of the revenue recognition standard, IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with
customers”, adopted early by your Company as of 1 August 2017.

**Justification of Assessments**
In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code
(Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the following
assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not
provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Impairment tests
are performed on trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life in
accordance with the method described in Note 6.2.5 to the financial statements. We assessed the

F 115


-----

appropriateness of the method implemented based on a range of estimates and examined the data and
assumptions used by the group in performing these tests. On this basis, we assessed the
reasonableness of these estimates.

**Verification of the Information Pertaining to the Group Presented in the Management Report**
As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France
the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report of the President. We have
no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial
statements.

**Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated**
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European
Union, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company
or to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.

**Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements**
Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an
audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement
when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken
on the basis of these financial statements.
As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (ode de commerce), our statutory
audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the
affairs of the Company.
As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the
statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:

- Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and
obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion.
The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the
override of internal control.

- Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the internal control.

- Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.

- Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This
assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory

F 116


-----

auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not
provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.

- Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these
statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair
presentation

- Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.
The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the
consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial
statements.

**VI – Notes to the consolidated financial statements**


**_1._** **_Overview_**


**_1.1._** **_General information on the parent company_**

The parent company, AFFLELOU (“AA” or “the Company”), is a French joint stock company controlled by
LION SENECA Lux 2, headquartered at 11 rue d’Argenson, 75008 Paris. The “Group” comprises the parent
company, which wholly owns 3AB OPTICAL DEVELOPMENT (“3ABOD”) and its subsidiaries.

The Board of Directors of AFFLELOU approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2018 on 15 November 2018.

**_1.2._** **_General information on the Group_**

The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major
player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries
in Africa, Asia and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a
network of franchises and directly-owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN
AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN”, “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” and “OPTIMIL” banners.

The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue
generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their
purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of
products to franchisees, notably branded company products.

The Group owns a network of stores so as to (i) retain control over flagship stores located in strategic areas
and key geographies, (ii) test new business initiatives and identify best practices before applying them to
the franchisees, and (iii) manage the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at
the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group for
subsequent transfer to new franchisees.

Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com,
malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites.

**_2._** **_Highlights_**

**_2.1._** **_Change in the networks_**

The Group had 1,497 stores (1,408 optical stores and 89 audio stores) as of 31 July 2018, compared with
1,474 stores (1,400 optical stores and 74 audio stores) as of 31 July 2017.

The portfolio of 89 audio stores is complemented by 209 spaces in optical stores in France and Spain,
bringing the total of audio outlets to 298, compared with 244 as of 31 July 2017.

As of 31 July 2018, the Group operated in 17 countries, split into three zones, France with 978 points of
sale, Spain with 378 points of sale, and other countries representing 141 points of sale.

The portfolio of directly-owned stores, located mainly in France and Spain, represented 168 optical stores
and 2 audio stores as of 31 July 2018, compared with 179 optical stores and 5 audio stores as of 31 July
2017.

**_2.2._** **_Refinancing of the group’s borrowings_**

F 124


-----

In October 2017, the Group completely refinanced the €440 million high-yield bond debt (€365 million in
senior secured notes issued by 3ABOD and €75 million in senior notes issued by LSF2) via the issue of a
new high-yield bond (senior secured notes) issued by 3ABOD in the amount of €425 million.
The features of this bond are similar to those of the pre-existing debt issued by 3ABOD. Its maturity is 6
years. It is split into two tranches, one of €250 million at a fixed rate of 4% per annum and the other of €175
million at a floating rate of Euribor +4.125%, compared with an average rate of 6% per annum for the
previous bonds. The collateral attached to the new debt is comparable with that previously in place.
Fixed-rate bonds may be redeemed early under certain conditions, with penalties, until 1[st] April 2022.
Floating rate bonds may be redeemed early, without penalties, starting on 1[st] October 2019.

**_2.3._** **_Transactions on capital and securities giving access to the Group’s capital_**

On 13 October 2017, the Group redeemed 4,457,633 convertible bonds for €9.0 million.

On 27 December 2017, the majority shareholders, LSL2 and Holding AA & Fils, subscribed to an Afflelou
SAS capital increase in a total amount of €21,097 thousand (share premium included) giving rise to the
issuance of 10,217,127 new class D preference shares (ADPD), in exchange for the partial repayment to
LSL2 and Holding AAOC (the latter having delegated its right to Holding AA & Fils, the subscriber) of
10,217,127 convertible bonds (OCA) issued by Afflelou SAS. Also on 27 December 2017, (i) the
management of Afflelou contributed its stake in Tchin Management 1 (TM1) and Tchin Management 2
(TM2) to Tchin Management 3 (TM3), a newly formed management holding company, and (ii) TM1 and
TM2 merged with Afflelou SAS with retroactive effect from 1 August 2017, resulting in a capital reduction
of 480,997 shares in a total amount of €257 thousand.

On 28 June 2018, the majority shareholders, LSL2 and Holding AA & Fils, subscribed to an Afflelou SAS
capital increase in a total amount of €149,999 thousand, with no share premium, via the issuance of
280,898,875 new common shares, in exchange for the partial repayment to LSL2 and Holding AAOC (the
latter having delegated its right to Holding AA & Fils, the subscriber) of 68,063,795 convertible bonds (OCA)
issued by Afflelou SAS. On the same date, 1,795,513 class D preference shares (ADPD) were converted
into 1,795,513 class E Afflelou SAS preference shares. The class E preference shares are described in
section 1.1.1.

On 30 June 2018, Afflelou SAS issued 16,116,000 AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants to replace the LSF2
mezzanine warrants unexercised as of 30 June 2018, the date of the definitive completion of the merger
by way of absorption of LSF2 by Afflelou SAS. Of the 16,166,000 AFFLELOU mezzanine warrants issued,
6,596,000 tranche A AFFLELOU warrants give the right to subscribe for a maximum of 6,596,000 common
shares of AFFLELOU SAS, subject to any adjustments, and 9,520,000 tranche B AFFLELOU mezzanine
warrants give the right to subscribe for a maximum number of 9,520,000 common shares, subject to any
adjustments.

**_2.4._** **_Stake in Portuguese group OPTIVISAO_**

The Group holds a 29.77% stake in OPTIVISAO, a franchise company that ranks among the leaders in the
optical sector in Portugal.

During the previous year, certain investors sold their respective stakes, representing a combined total of
59.42% of the share capital, to BRODHEIM. The Group has challenged the terms of these sales, for which
it was unable to assert its right of first refusal. As such, the Group has established an escrow arrangement
with the Portuguese State, guaranteeing the payment of the securities should the dispute be decided in its
favour, allowing it to acquire some of the securities purchased by BRODHEIM, representing a 38.74%
interest.

The discussions initiated with the majority shareholder BRODHEIM with a view to reaching an amicable
solution to the dispute between the two parties continued during the year, and should soon result in the
conclusion of a memorandum of understanding by which AFFLELOU will sell its stake in OPTIVISAO to
BRODHEIM. The conclusion of this memorandum would make it possible to conclude the judicial
proceedings in progress and thereby recover the amounts sequestered in this context (see Note 6.2.7).

**_2.5._** **_Appointment of Didier PASCUAL as CEO of the Group_**

On 4 February 2018, the Group announced the appointment of Didier PASCUAL as Chief Executive Officer
to replace LJV Capital represented by Frédéric POUX.

**_3._** **_Accounting policies_**

**_3.1._** **_Standards and rules applied_**

The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2018 were prepared in
accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting
Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under European Regulation 1606/2002 dated 19
July 2002. These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International
Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS
IC), as approved in the European Union, application of which was mandatory as of the year under review,
which are available on the website of the European Commission (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/).

The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in
preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2017, with the exception of new
standards, amendments and interpretations applicable in financial years beginning on or after 1 August
2017:

**Standards, interpretations and amendments mandatory as of 1 August 2017:**
 Amendments to IAS 7 Disclosure Initiative – Disclosures related to financing activities;
 Amendments to IAS 12 Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses;
 Annual improvements, 2014-2016 cycle.
These standards and amendments did not have a material impact on the Group accounts as of 31 July
2018.

**Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards applied early from 1 August 2017:**
 IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The Group has early adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers as of 1 August
2017. The transition was made using the simplified retrospective method, without restatement of
the comparative information. This standard is the new unified standard for revenue recognition. It
notably replaces IAS 18 Revenue, previously applied by the Group.
In preparation for the transition to IFRS 15, the Group first conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis
of the main issues that could impact the financial statements. The conclusions of this analysis and the
impacts on the financial statements as of 31 July 2018 are as follows (in thousands of euros):
      - The main impact concerns the recognition of sales of Afflelou branded products through a
service provider. The impact on opening equity is negative €4,470 thousand.
      - The impact reduces revenue for the year by €119 thousand compared with what it would have
been under IAS 18.
The Group also analysed the nature of flows and its relationship with franchisees, notably in the context of
its central purchasing activity. Given its contractual relationship with suppliers on the one hand and
franchisees on the other, the Group concluded that it acts on its own account in these transactions and that
purchase and sales transactions should be recognized in their gross amount, without any change
compared to the current accounting treatment.

**Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved or in**
**the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet mandatory as**
**of 31 July 2018:**
 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.
IFRS 9 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 August 2018.
The Group will apply IFRS 9 from 1 August 2018 retrospectively with a cumulative catch-up of the
impact on equity at the date of first application and without restatement of the comparative
information.

F 126


-----

On the basis of preliminary work carried out to date, the Group does not expect a material impact.
 IFRS 16 Leases.
IFRS 16 is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 August 2018. This standard, which
will supersede IAS 17 and its interpretations, will result in the recognition of most leases under a
single model in the balance sheet in the form of a right-to-use asset and a lease liability
(abandonment of the classification as operating or finance leases for lessees).
The Group has started work to determine the impact of this standard on its financial statements,
but is not yet in a position to provide quantitative information on the prospective impact. The main
types of contracts concerned are property leases. The choice of the transition method will be made
once the work in progress is concluded.
 Amendments to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payments;
 Annual improvements, 2015-2017 cycle;
 Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures;
 IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration;
 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments.

The Group has elected not to early apply these standards and interpretations. The impact of the application
of these amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently being assessed.

**_3.2._** **_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the
takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control.

**_3.2.1. Consolidated entities_**

The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 _Consolidated_
_Financial Statements, when it:_
 has power over the investee;
 is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
 has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining
economic benefits.
Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income
derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of
subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the
Group as a whole.

**_3.2.2. Associates_**

The Group has no interests in joint ventures or associates.

**_3.2.3. Business combinations_**

The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations.

Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method:
 the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including
any earn-out payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earnout payment are recognised in profit or loss;
 the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by
goodwill, which is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position.

The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis
when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value
has been determined, adjustments are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur
within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and
circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognised directly

F 127


-----

in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the
proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured:
 either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognised for the portion related to non-controlling
interests (full goodwill method);
 or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only
goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method).

Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating
income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are
measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognised either as adjustments to the
consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the
provisions of IFRS 3.

In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is
remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine
goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value
previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in
respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is recycled in profit or loss.

**_3.3._** **_Basis of valuation, judgements and use of estimates_**

The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS
require or permit the use of the fair value option.

The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the
value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and
valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of
the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including
trademarks) and the measurement of provisions. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process,
the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future
results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are
described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following
notes:

**Note** **Estimate** **Nature of estimate**

3.7 and 6.2.3.3 Impairment testing of At the level of individual CGUs

impairment

3.18.2 and Deferred tax Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax
6.1.8.4 assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and temporary
differences

**_3.4._** **_Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates_**

**_3.4.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency at
the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign
currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange
differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognised in “Other financial income” or “Other
financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised directly in other
comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of the said gain or loss is also recognised in other
comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of foreign
exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in Note 3.11.
Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date,

-----

and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at the date the fair
value was determined.

**_3.4.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies_**

The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their
respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity
operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated
into euros as follows:
 items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate
prevailing on the balance sheet date;
 items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period,
as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations;
 differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance
sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the
period are recognised in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation”.

**_3.5._** **_Intangible assets excluding goodwill_**

An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and
controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An
intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or
contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis
over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are
not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually within the cash-generating unit (CGU) to which they
belong. Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria:
 Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition;
 Prospective long-term profitability.

Licences and software have useful lives of between one and four years, and are amortised over the relevant
period.

Lastly, leasehold rights are not amortised, but are tested for impairment (Note 3.7).

**_3.6._** **_Property, plant and equipment_**

**_3.6.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement_**

Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial
consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying amount of
property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the alternative
method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant and equipment.
The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

**_3.6.2. Depreciation_**

The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment
held:
Property, plant and equipment Useful life Depreciation method

Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line
Industrial machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Straight line
Technical equipment under finance leases 3 to 10 years Straight line
Other property, plant and equipment 5 years Straight line

-----

Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items
are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also
performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and
equipment, CGUs or group of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from
unfavourable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives as of
the acquisition date.

Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of
CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset, CGU or group of CGUs is the
greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on
projections of expected future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalisation
in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair
value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets
in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the
recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment
loss is recognised against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs,
the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other nonrecurring operating items” in the income statement.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may
be reversed later if the recoverable amount later comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses
recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed.

On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured
based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another
method is deemed more pertinent.

**_3.8._** **_Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale_**

Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly
likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets (or groups
of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to
sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated first to goodwill and then
to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment losses resulting from the
classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well as gains and losses on
subsequent measurement are recognised in profit or loss.

Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible and tangible assets are no longer amortised or
depreciated.

Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that:
      - represents a separate activity or geographical area,
      - is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area,
      - is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.

The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an
earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.

When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other
comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at
the beginning of the comparative period.

**_3.9._** **_Leases_**

In the course of its various business activities, the Group uses assets made available or makes assets
available under lease arrangements. Such leases are analysed on the basis of the situations and indicators
set out in IAS 17 Leases to determine whether they are operating or finance leases.
 As lessee

F 130


-----

    - Finance leases: on initial recognition, assets held under finance leases are recognised as property,
plant and equipment with offsetting debt. The asset is recognised at the fair value of the leased
asset at the date of inception of the contract, or, if lower, at the present value of minimum lease
payments. It is depreciated over the term of the contract.

    - Operating leases: payments made under operating leases (other than the costs of services such
as insurance and maintenance) are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis
over the term of the lease.
 As lessor
All lease management contracts signed by the Group with its franchisees are operating leases.
Rental income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the fixed terms of commercial leases.

**_3.10._** **_Other financial assets and liabilities_**

Pursuant to IAS 39, financial assets are classified in one of four categories:
 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;
 loans and receivables;
 held-to-maturity investments;
 available-for-sale financial assets.

The classification determines the accounting treatment of the assets in question. It is determined by the
Group on the date of initial recognition, depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Purchases and sales of financial assets are accounted for as of the transaction date, when the Group
undertakes to purchase or sell assets. A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the
cash flows from the financial asset expire or the asset is transferred.

1. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets whose payments are fixed or determinable,
which are not traded in an active market and which are not held for trading or available for sale. Such
assets are initially measured at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest
rate method. For short-term receivables with no stated interest rate, the fair value and amortised cost are
equivalent to the amount of the original invoice unless the effective interest rate has a significant impact.
Such assets are tested for impairment when there is an indication of loss of value. Impairment is recognised
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. This category consists of vendor loans
granted to franchisees who acquire stores from the Group and deposits paid to Group lessors. For vendor
loans, amortised cost is equal to the face value, in the absence of significant costs associated with their
establishment. Vendor loans can be repaid early as desired by franchisees (using either bank refinancing
or their own resources). Receivables related to investments, security deposits, current loans and
receivables, and trade receivables are also included in this category. They are classified as current or noncurrent “Other financial assets” and in “Trade receivables”.

2. Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are not included in the above
categories. They are measured at fair value. Unrealised gains or losses are recorded in other
comprehensive income until the sale is finalised. However, when an available-for-sale financial asset
shows objective evidence of impairment, the cumulative loss is recognised in profit or loss. For listed
securities, fair value corresponds to market prices. For unlisted securities, it is determined by reference to
recent transactions or using valuation techniques based on reliable and observable market data.

**_3.11._** **_Derivatives_**

In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to
foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet in other
current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and
carried at fair value as of the transaction date. Change in the fair value of derivative instruments is always
recognised in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied.

Hedge accounting is only applied if the following conditions are met:
 a hedging relationship is clearly identified, formalised and documented from the date of its
inception;

F 131


-----

 the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated prospectively and retrospectively.
Confidence in the results obtained must be within a range of 80% to 125%.
Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair
value. The effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in
profit or loss.

**_3.12._** **_Inventories_**

Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens
products (held as part of our central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly-owned stores
(consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products). Inventories in the
balance sheet may under certain circumstances include stores held temporarily as property dealer.
Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any
unsold items so as to align them with their realisable values. Inventories held in stores are subject to
impairment, in accordance with the following rules:
 20% for products of more than one year,
 40% for products of more than two years,
 80% for products of more than three years,
 100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer
marketed.

**_3.13._** **_Other current assets and liabilities_**

**_3.13.1. Trade receivables and other current assets_**

Trade receivables are carried at amortised cost. Receivables relating to the central payment and
purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. An impairment is recognised when the
outstanding carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. Other current assets chiefly include
receivables in respect of the central payment activity, including future settlements to suppliers of
franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers, to be passed on to franchisees. An
impairment is recognised when the outstanding carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.

**_3.13.2. Trade payables and other current liabilities_**

Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at
amortised cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity,
including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers,
to be passed on to franchisees.

**_3.14._** **_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of
investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into
known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held in order to meet shortterm cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of
cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in the balance sheet less
bank overdrafts.

**_3.15._** **_Provisions and contingent liabilities_**

A contingent liability is:
 a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the
occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity;
or
 a present obligation arising from past events but which is not recognised because:
      - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to
settle the obligation; or
      - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.

F 132


-----

A provision is recognised when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement
of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming
amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are
subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant
retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including
rental expenses, taxes and related expenses), less any sublease income.

**_3.16._** **_Employee benefits and similar_**

Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types
of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to
make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does
not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the
current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for
the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes.

Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis
of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives
rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final
obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations
vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. The
biggest such plans and termination payments are subject to an actuarial valuation by independent actuaries
every year; valuations are performed at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account
the level of future compensation, the probable length of employment, life expectancy and staff turnover.

Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated
results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined
benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.

Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognised in income from ordinary activities. Reductions,
settlements and past service costs are recognised in income from ordinary activities. The provision
recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair
value of plan assets.

**_3.17._** **_Borrowings_**

**_3.17.1. Loans and other financial liabilities_**

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognised at fair value less
transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective
interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying amount of a
financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest date to repricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums and/or
discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a
financial liability.

Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at
amortised cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk.
Hedging relationships are described in Note 3.10 “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the
fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are
recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are
expensed as incurred.

**_3.17.2. Compound instruments_**

Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the
case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognised in shareholders’

F 133


-----

equity and in loans and financial liabilities, on the basis of their respective weighting, in accordance with
IAS 32 _Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their_
measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption),
discounted at the market rate (taking into account the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination)
of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or
redeemable for shares. The portion recognised in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount
of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected
disbursements over the term of the loan in order to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan
recorded in borrowings.

**_3.18._** **_Taxes_**

**_3.18.1. Current taxes_**

The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its
income is taxable. The Group recognises the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée
_des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on_
the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

**_3.18.2. Deferred tax_**

In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they
are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability
settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognised in profit or loss for the
year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also
recognised directly in equity. A deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences
relating to investments in subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary
difference is reversed, or if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred
tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carry-forwards and tax credits are limited to the
estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end of
the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
not discounted.

**_3.19._** **_Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current_**

For the majority of the Group’s activities, it has been decided that the criterion for this classification is the
date of liquidation of the asset or settlement of the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current
if more than 12 months.

**_3.20._** **_Revenue recognition_**

The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services:

 Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged
to franchisees. Revenue is recognised as and when control of the service is transferred over the
duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognised on the date on which
the underlying sale occurs.
 Network purchase revenues: sales to franchisees of eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and eyeglass
frames through the Group’s central purchasing structure; sales of products bearing the ALAIN
AFFLELOU trademark to exclusive distributors and franchisees, recorded at the effective date of
completion of the sale; and referral, delcredere and distribution commissions to referenced
suppliers and finder’s fees accounted for as and when sales are made.
 Revenues from directly-owned stores: retail sales of directly-owned stores operating under the
“ALAIN AFFLELOU” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners, and sales resulting from the “ALAIN

F 134


-----

AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” hearing aid activity. Revenue is recognised on the date of transfer of
control.
The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted.

**_3.21._** **_Cost of purchases_**

The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely:
 The purchasing cost of eyeglass frames
 The purchasing cost of eyeglass lenses
 The purchasing cost of contact lenses
 The purchasing cost of accessories and other goods
 Change in inventories of all of the above purchases
 The cost of communication purchases

**_3.22._** **_Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items_**

Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the
Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To
facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items
for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other operating items”. Other operating income and
expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include:
 restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures;
 impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognised primarily following impairment testing of
cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill;
 capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisitions or
disposals);
 major disputes.
These items, excluded from operating income, are other non-current operating income and expenses,
which, due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as part of operating income from
the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events that are both limited in scope and very
unusual.

**_3.23._** **_Operating profit_**

Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether
such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant
items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”.

**_4._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation_**

**_4.1._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2018_**

The Group acquired two Spanish companies (Selene Vision SL and Anta Socuellamos SL), each managing
a point of sale. These acquisitions did not have a material impact on these consolidated financial
statements, which are therefore comparable with those of previous years. On 31 January 2018, the Group
also acquired three French companies, two of which are already operated by a franchisee under a lease
management agreement (Academie Vision and Groupe Optique Méditerranée) and one operating as a
branch (Cathare Optique).

**_4.2._** **_Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2017_**

The main change in the Group’s scope of consolidation was the creation of DIGITAL EYEWEAR at the end
of September 2016 following the acquisition of two pure player brands, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com.

**_5._** **_Segment reporting_**


**_5.1._** **_Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments_**

The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography, namely “France”, “Spain” and “Other
countries”.

The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central purchasing unit, a
central listing and payment unit, directly-owned stores and an audio business operated under a master
franchise. The Group has replicated the established organisation of its French operations in Spain, and
aims ultimately to repeat this process in the “Other countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment
notably includes Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal. This segment includes a central purchasing unit in
Belgium, and has only a few directly-owned stores, in Portugal.

The segment reporting presented here was prepared on the basis of the internal reporting data reviewed
by the Chairman and CEO, the “chief operating decision maker” of the Group within the meaning laid down
in IFRS 8, who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them.

### Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial indicators used to measure segment performance are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. These two indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note, and are reconciled with operating income.  Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in “Other countries”:   Our trading company specialising in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB)  Our Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds supplier contracts for the entire group.
 The trading and supplier contract activities impact the entire Group. The geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the “Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the results of the trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following allocation key:   the result of the AAB trading branch in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating country of franchisees’ purchases in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames delivered during the year.  Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognised as revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers. The chief operating decision maker does not review information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities. 
 No customer accounts for more than 10% of the Group’s revenue.
 The information on the Group’s various activities and services is provided in Note 1.2, Note 3.20 on revenue recognition and Note 6.1.1 on revenue by activity.

**_5.3._** **_Discontinued operations_**

Management undertook a plan to dispose of the entire Optimil business during fiscal 2018 as part of a
strategic decision to refocus the Group on its key areas of expertise.

The Optimil activity was not previously classified as an activity held for sale. The income statement has
been restated to present this activity separately from continuing operations.

In addition, the OPTIVISAO securities are classified as assets held for sale with no impact on the income
statement (see Note 6.2.7).

(1) The fair value of trademarks and other intangible assets results from the allocation to trademarks and other
intangible assets of business combinations performed by the Group.

Deferred tax assets representing tax losses are not recognised in the following situations:
 When they relate to companies outside the tax group that have been loss-making for several years
and for which a return to profit is not deemed likely in the near future.
 When they relate to tax losses that are unlikely to be used in view of the earnings outlooks of the
companies in question and the information available as of the date of the financial statements.

As of the balance sheet date, the stock of unrecognised tax losses was as follows:

Foreign companies:

Tax losses of other companies 869 168 554 92

**Total** **35,730** **9,509** **33,912** **9,504**

The losses of the French tax group including AFFLELOU, AAFR, 3ABOD, 3ABOE, OPTICAL FINANCE,
LOA, LSFA and DIGITAL EYEWEAR can be carried forward for an unlimited period. Losses before the
entry into the tax group of L’Opticien Afflelou (LOA) and DIGITAL EYEWEAR can be carried forward for an
unlimited period on an individual basis. Losses before the entry into the tax group of F2L, ACADEMIE
VISION, GROUPE OPTICAL MEDITERANEE and CATHARE OPTIQUE can be carried forward for an
unlimited time on an individual basis.

For French companies, the amount of tax losses offset in a given fiscal year may not exceed €1 million,
plus 50% of the amount of profit against which deficits are offset above this threshold. Losses can only be
carried back to the year prior to that in respect of which the tax loss is recognised, within a limit of €1 million.

In Portugal, losses generated by AAP between 2010 and 2013 must be used within five years. Losses
generated since 2014 must be used within 12 years. In addition, effective 1 January 2012, the amount of
the loss attributable in respect of a given fiscal year is capped at 75% of taxable income for that year. The
tax losses of Spanish companies can be carried forward for a period of no more than 18 years. The
absorption of Ankasur Opticos, Usera Opticos and Optica UFE by AAO resulted in the loss of unused tax
losses.

**_6.1.9. Earnings per share_**

Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares less
the weighted average number of shares held by consolidated companies. Diluted earnings per share are
based on the weighted average number of shares defined above, plus the weighted average number of
potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive shares are: shares granted in connection with
convertible bonds issued at the time of the Group’s refinancing on 17 July 2012, which include bonds
convertible into shares (OCA), i.e. potentially 116,368,571 shares, and bonds convertible into preference
shares (OC ADPD), i.e. potentially 711,895 shares; and, shares granted in connection with class A
mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 6,596,000 shares, and class B mezzanine equity warrants, i.e.
potentially 9,520,000 shares.

The instruments issued by the Group did not have any dilutive effect in fiscal 2017 or 2018. The maximum
number of potential dilutive shares in future years is 133,196,466.

The Group was the subject of two successive acquisitions following its delisting in 2007, with a final
acquisition on 17 July 2012 by Lion Seneca Lux 2 (LSL2) via its LSF1 holding company subsidiary (now
known as AFFLELOU). This resulted in the valuation of the Alain Afflelou trademark at €650 million as part
of the accounting for the takeover pursuant to IFRS 3.

The Happyview trademark has been impaired due to the operating losses it generates and the limited
prospects of the online sales website. The Group has embarked on a review of its e-commerce strategy,
aiming to capitalise on the main branded website, using the skills and experiences acquired from
malentille.com and happyview.fr. Under this strategy, the Happyview brand could be abandoned in favour
of Alain Afflelou and the branded website, thereby justifying the full impairment of the Happyview.fr
trademark. The Group has also begun discussions with a view to withdrawing from the commercial and
office lease of the premises located in rue Magenta in Paris. As of 31 July 2018, the remaining residual
rent for these premises was €0.5 million.

The development of Optimil to spearhead the Group’s strategy in the entry-level segment in Spain did not
have the anticipated results. The objective of rapid integration of the network within the Group resulted in
a sharp reduction in the number of stores, and the implementation of the services offered by the Group to
the franchisees at the same time proved difficult in a country where opticians have remained culturally very
independent. In 2018, the Group made the decision to resell this business, which became loss-making
following its acquisition. Advanced negotiations with a potential buyer put the disposal price at €1, thereby
justifying the full impairment of the trademark within the Group’s assets.

Impairment testing of leasehold rights is performed on a store-by-store basis, based on the estimated
market value. When in the course of negotiations the Group has indicative offers, it uses them to measure
the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the probable selling price, calculated
on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each store, in line with potential market
conditions.

In 2016, the original goodwill was allocated, following the change in the Group’s internal reporting structure,
to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to
adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not on its own account generate cash flows
substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three
country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The OPTICAL DISCOUNT, Happyview et Malentille.com
trademarks and goodwill have been allocated to the “France” operating segment. The OPTIMIL trademark
and goodwill have been allocated to the “Spain” operating segment.

_6.2.5.2. Impairment testing methodology – Estimates for the calculation of value in use_

Future cash flow projections are made on the basis of budgets and medium-term business plans approved
by the Board of Directors. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. In addition to the five-year
business plan established by the Group, the key assumptions used as of 31 July 2018 and 31 July 2017
are a perpetual growth rate of 1.5% and a discount rate of 7.5% (except for the Spain CGU, for which a
discount rate of 8% was used).

_6.2.5.3. Results of impairment testing_

_6.2.5.3.1._ _Impairment testing of leasehold rights in 2017 and 2018_

The leasehold rights held by LOA and AAO were tested as of 31 July 2017 and 2018. Impairment losses
were recognised on these assets in the amounts of €4,296 thousand as of 31 July 2018 and €3,598
thousand as of 31 July 2017, with reversals in the amounts of €2,053 thousand as of 31 July 2018 and
€3,497 thousand as of 31 July 2017.

_6.2.5.3.2._ _Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2018_

Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2018 revealed values in use in excess of the net asset
value of the France, Spain and Other countries CGUs. An impairment loss of €3,382 thousand was
recorded as of 31 July 2018 on the Optimil and Happyview trademarks. A 5.0% variation in adjusted
EBITDA in 2018, projected over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of
approximately €48 million on the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €7 million of the Spain CGU and
€2 million of the Other countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of 31
July 2018. The table below shows the potential impact on the expense in fiscal 2018 of an upward or
downward variation in the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate used for the testing performed as of
31 July 2018.

Available-for-sale financial assets in the amount of €1,718 thousand represent OPTIVISAO equity
securities. The fair value used by the Group to measure OPTIVISAO equity securities is based on the price
of the most recent known transactions. The change in fair value during the year was €354 thousand. As of
31 July 2018, these equity investments were reclassified as assets held for sale. The investment in
OPTIVISAO is not equity accounted, as the Group does not have significant influence over the company,
within the meaning of IAS 28.6. The Group is not represented on the company’s governing bodies and has
no other way to influence the strategy and management of the entity’s activities.

Other movements on Loans reflect the repayment of the Master Loan Agreement between the Group and
its shareholder in the amount of €2,588 thousand. Changes in acquisitions and disposals include vendor
loans made on the disposal of stores by AAO and LOA, as well as staggering agreements in respect of
receivables granted to certain franchisees by Alain Afflelou Spain.

Other financial assets are primarily security deposits.

**_6.2.7._** **_Assets held for sale_**

Assets held for sale in the amount of €2,000 thousand as of 31 July 2018 represent OPTIVISAO equity
securities, which were classified as financial assets as of 31 July 2017. Management has embarked on a
plan to sell the OPTIVISAO equity securities. An agreement is in the process of being finalised with the
majority shareholder.

million class E preference shares. The Group’s common shares carry one vote; they give rights to dividends
and the liquidation surplus, after the rights attached to preference shares have been satisfied. Preference
shares do not carry voting rights.

Class D preference shares have priority rights to all distributions of dividends, reserves or premiums until
full payment of the cumulative annual D priority dividend equal to 14% of the issue price (including bonus,
where applicable) and capitalised (for the portion of the dividend not paid in respect of prior years) annually
(at each reporting date) on the basis of a 360-day year and for the first time at the date of the first closing
following the date of issue of the class D preference shares.

Each class E preference share carries 4.127 voting rights and a financial right and a right in the event of a
corresponding liquidation or exit, and, within the limits of (i) Articles 9.6, 9.7 and 9.8 of the Articles of
Incorporation and (ii) the rules referred to in Schedule 2 of the Articles of Incorporation, financial rights and

No dividends were paid in respect of fiscal 2017 in 2018.

**_6.2.14. Employee benefits and similar_**

These benefits primarily cover retirement allowances in France.

Retirement allowances in France
In France, the retirement allowance is a lump sum paid to employees when they retire. The amount
depends on the length of the individual’s service as of the date of retirement. It is determined on the basis
of collective and/or company agreements. The plan does not entitle employees to any allowance until they
reach retirement age (unvested). Retirement allowances are not linked to other standard pension benefits
such as pensions paid by Social Security or supplementary pension funds (ARRCO and AGIRC). The
assumptions used by the collecting body are as follows:
 mortality table: TF00-02,
 rules governing retirement benefits: from the national collective agreement for eyewear retail,
 retirement age: 65 years for the Manager category, 62 years for the Supervisor category,
 62 years for the Worker/Employee category,
 type of retirement: voluntary departure,

_6.2.16.3._ _Breakdown of the main sources of funding_

_6.2.16.3.1._ _High-yield bond debt of €425 million_

In October 2017, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of the two bonds on 3ABOD and LSF2,
in the amounts of €365 million and €75 million respectively, via the issuance of a new high-yield bond in a
total amount of €425 million on 3ABOD. 3ABOD issued €425 million in senior secured notes on 16 October
2017, with redemption at maturity on 15 October 2023. The bond is split into two tranches, one of €250
million at a fixed rate of 4% per annum and the other of €175 million at a floating rate of Euribor +4.125%.
It is redeemable early without penalty, commencing on 15 October 2019.
### This high-yield bond is subject to limited financial constraints: 
 The Group is not subject to compliance with financial ratios such as a leverage ratio (Net
Debt/EBITDA).
 The restrictions primarily relate to the realisation of transactions related to additional funding
(incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, etc.).
 In terms of collateral, the new bonds mainly benefit from the pledge in favour of their holders of
shares of the major Group companies, as well as the pledge of the Group’s main bank accounts.
Under the terms of these bonds, the Group must report its quarterly condensed consolidated financial
statements and its annual audited consolidated financial statements within two and four months
respectively. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with all the conditions of these bonds
as of 31 July 2018.

_6.2.16.3.2._ _Revolving credit facility of €30 million_

The new bond was accompanied by the establishment of a €30 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This
is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements. It was established on 17
October 2017, with a term of 54 months from its inception. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate
combining Euribor and a margin, the margin being calculated on the basis of a leverage ratio. A non-use
commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU, LSF2 and
3ABOD have been pledged as collateral, as have as the securities of potentially borrowing subsidiaries
(3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the
RCF would not generate penalties. This credit facility has been undrawn since its establishment. Reporting
obligations are the same as for bond lenders. The Group must also certify, period-by-period, that the
adjusted EBITDA of the prior 12 months is above €45 million. The most recent such report was made for
the quarter ended 30 April 2018. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with terms of this
credit facility as of 31 July 2018.

bonds mature on 17 July 2027. Conversion is possible at any time, on the basis of one share for one bond.
Early repayment is possible at the issuer’s initiative, subject to the conditions of the subordination
agreement, or, at the holder’s initiative, subject to compliance with the terms of the subordination
agreement, in case of change of control or IPO. On 17 July 2012, AFFLELOU issued 1,820,000 bonds
convertible into class R preference shares (OC ADP) at a price of 1 euro at par, paying a fixed interest rate
of 14%. As of 31 July 2018, the OC ADP were valued at €1,586,716, after the capitalisation of interest.
Interest on the OC ADP is capitalised (the first capitalisation took place on 31 July 2013), the payment will

Equity component of convertible bonds
The convertible bonds were recorded as debt and as equity. As of the date of issue, in accordance with
IAS 32, the debt component was measured by discounting the value of the contractual cash flows of the
convertible debt at an estimated market rate of 17% (see Note 3.17.2). The difference between the value
of the compound instrument and the debt component has been recorded in equity in “Other reserves” in
the initial amount of €66,274 thousand. As of 31 July 2018, the instrument was valued at €38,165 thousand.

**_6.3._** **_Notes on risk exposure_**

As of 31 July 2018, exposure to various market risks can be analysed as follows:

**_6.3.1._** **_The Group’s position in relation to interest rate risk_**

The Group’s exposure to interest rate risk as of 31 July 2018 is immaterial. The Group’s policy is to ensure
that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or on floating rate borrowings by contracting
derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows attributable to interest rate risk.

**_6.3.2._** **_The Group’s position in relation to currency risk_**

The Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the
euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases, which are predominantly denominated is US
dollars. To address this risk, the Group has:
 established agreements on purchasing conditions with some of its suppliers, on the basis of a fixed
dollar/euro exchange rate, and more specifically with Okia, its main supplier, with which a derivative
embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate
compared with the rate set in the contract to be shared equally between the two parties, and
 ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an
appreciation of the dollar against the euro.

**_6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to equity risk_**

The Group’s exposure to equity risk was confined to its investment in OPTIVISAO.

**_6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk_**

The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held
by the Group. Generally speaking, the Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its
financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in delcredere
commissions.

**_6.3.5. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk_**

Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically
assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million undrawn revolving
credit facility to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed bank overdraft and
discounted trade receivables.

The valuation methods used for financial instruments as of 31 July 2018 are as follows:
 derivative financial instruments recorded in assets are valued at their market value;
 financial instruments recorded in liabilities, specifically other loans, are measured using other
valuation methods such as discounted cash flows, taking into account the Group’s credit risk and
interest rate conditions at the closing date.
The Group distinguishes three classes of financial instrument:
 Level 1: financial instruments measured using prices quoted in an active market;
 Level 2: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques
based on observable market parameters;
 Level 3: financial instruments measured at fair value using valuation techniques based on
unobservable parameters (parameters yielding valuations resulting from assumptions not based
on observable market transaction prices for the same instrument or observable market data
available as of the balance sheet date) or that are based only partially on such parameters.
The Group’s medium-term external borrowings (high-yield bonds traded in Dublin) belong to the Level 1
category; all other financial instruments belong to the Level 3 category. The tables above provide the
following information for the various classes of financial instrument:

- in the first column: the carrying amount

- in the second column: fair value pursuant to IFRS 7.25

- in the third column: the IAS 39 category under which they are valued pursuant to IFRS 7.8.

Lease payments relate to the buildings occupied by the Group, either as offices or commercial premises
(opticians), with marginal lease payments on operating leases corresponding primarily to leased computer
hardware without purchase commitments.
Sundry guarantees to third parties correspond chiefly to rental obligations that the Group has kept with
some lessors on stores sold, in exchange for similar commitments received in the Group’s favour, from
franchisee buyers. Lastly, sundry guarantees to third parties as of 31 July 2018 notably include the
commitment by L’OPTICIEN AFFLELOU to purchase six of the Group’s franchised business assets.

Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of
acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital. Secured
loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its capacity as guarantor
to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of 100% of each application
for financing, up to a maximum portion usually set at approximately 30%.

Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and guarantees
made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts of the central
payment structure.
 Measurement of commitments: property lease commitments are measured on the basis of the
period remaining until the end of the lease (without possibility of early release), as are other leases,
which relate chiefly to computer hardware. It is also noted that commitments in respect of finance
leases and operating leases relating primarily to the assets of stores (furniture, optical equipment,
etc.) are not included in the Group’s debt as reported in the table above if they do not include
specific commitments.
 Commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees: under franchise agreements,
franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the Group for the obligations
and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure. These guarantees are generally
prorated at 30% of annual sales excluding VAT in France and Spain; only guarantees and sureties
related to franchisees’ specific debts (agreements, staggered payments, vendor loans) are shown
in the table of commitments received.

**_6.6.2. Dependence of the Group on patents, licences and supply contracts_**

The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses or supply contracts.

**_6.6.3. Notification, lawsuits and disputes_**

Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of
their business, including disputes with tax, social security or customs authorities.

On 27 May 2015, the French Competition Authority notified Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of grievances,
accusing it of “having colluded with providers of eye- and sunglass frames, from 2003 at the latest and until
2009, to fix retail prices and to impede the fixing of prices through free competition in violation of the
provisions of Article L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 paragraph 1 of the TFEU”.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur responded to the grievances laid out by the French Competition Authority on 27
July 2015, vigorously contesting them on all points. In July 2016, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received a
report from the French Competition Authority in response. The report rejects the arguments put forward by
Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, but nevertheless narrows the period of the alleged practices, stating that the
practices at issue were spread as regards Alain Afflelou Franchiseur between 25 February 2005 and 31
December 2009. The report also caps the potential penalty at approximately €12.5 million.
The French Competition Authority issued a decision on the vertical agreement grievances on 24 February
2017. It decided to refer the issue back for further investigations. It is difficult to predict the outcome of the
new investigation, bearing in mind that it was deemed at this stage of the proceedings that collusion had
not been identified. The referral should result in a complementary notification that may not be issued for

several months. It is not possible to assess the amount of any fine to which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur may
be liable if the case brought by the French Competition Authority is successful.

Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, which continues to believe itself to be in the right, intends to continue contesting
the French Competition Authority’s allegations vigorously. Accordingly, no provision for this litigation has
been recorded in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.

On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT
deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities
amounted to €1.5 million.
Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group decided to pay the sum
corresponding to the principal adjustment of €966 thousand. Nevertheless, the Group initiated a legal
challenge, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The Group also called the vendor
warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1
million.

No litigation involving companies belonging to the Group is underway that, in the opinion of legal experts,
poses a risk to the Group’s normal and foreseeable operations or planned development. The Group does
not believe there to be any other disputes involving significant prospective risks liable to affect its assets,
results or financial condition for which provisions had not been set aside as of the year-end. No dispute,
taken individually, is significant at either the individual company or Afflelou Group level. The Group is not
aware of any other litigation or arbitration liable to have or having had in the recent past a significant impact
on the Afflelou Group’s financial position, business or earnings.
