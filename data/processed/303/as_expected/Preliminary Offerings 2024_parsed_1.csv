We believe that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist securities analysts, investors and other parties in evaluating us. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and similar measures are used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA PreIFRS 16, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin may not be indicative of our historical operating results, are not meant to be predictive of potential future results and undue reliance should not be placed upon these measures when evaluating an investment decision. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA PreIFRS 16, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. i ----- _See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our financial profile and capital structure—EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision” and “The pro forma and non-IFRS financial measures included in this Offering Memorandum are presented for informational purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations in the future”._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.5,Other Financial Measures,7.5.3,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net capital expenditure, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, and information related to our network, such as store count, network sales and like-for-like network sales growth. You should exercise caution in comparing Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net capital expenditure, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion, network sales and like-for-like network sales growth to similarly titled measures of other companies. The information presented by each of Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, net capital expenditure, free cash flow, free_ cash flow conversion, network sales and like-for-like network sales growth is unaudited and has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other accounting standards. In addition, the presentation of these measures is not intended to and does not comply with the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission; compliance with its requirements would require the Issuer to make changes to the presentation of this information. Definitions and, if applicable, reconciliations to IFRS measures, are presented under “Summary _Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Other Financial Information”._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.6,“Free cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16 minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii),7.6.1,Group’s Commercial Performance,"We also present network sales and like-for-like network sales growth in this Offering Memorandum. Network sales include all optical and hearing aid sales generated by the stores bearing our various banners (including franchised stores and directly-owned stores) as well as online sales. Network sales as reported by our franchisees do not reflect financial information of the Issuer itself, but rather are based on reported monthly statements prepared by our franchisees in accordance with the provisions of our franchise agreements. While we review and conduct control procedures on network sales figures, network sales are unaudited and are not part of our accounting system. Due to certain changes in our scope of consolidation, our network sales data may not be entirely comparable. Network sales are not an audited figure and therefore investors should not place undue reliance on network sales. ii ----- For example, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, we made the decision to discontinue the Optical Discount banner across all geographies. Shortly after making such decision, we initiated a rapid reduction in the number of stores operating under this banner. As at July 31, 2023, 22 stores under the Optical Discount banner remained, compared to 90 as at July 31, 2022. Pursuant to this strategic decision, we aim to completely shut down the Optical Discount banner by December 2024. As a consequence, the sales of the Optical Discount banner are no longer integrated in our total network sales (although they are still included in our like-for-like sales for the periods presented herein). Like-for-like network sales correspond to sales generated by stores which were open throughout the periods under review, based on a full fiscal year, and which did not undergo any substantial changes during such periods (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than one month), in order for sales performance in a period to be comparable to that of the prior period. The calculation of like-for-like network sales does not take store closures in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic into account. Like-for-like network sales are calculated at constant exchange rates (applying the prior year’s exchange rates to the current year), as a very small portion of network sales are currently exposed to currency risk. Like-for-like network sales growth has not been adjusted based on the potential impact on network sales resulting from the different number of working days between two periods. The growth in like-for-like network sales for a given period corresponds to the increase in sales in stores which were open throughout the entire relevant period under consideration and the entire prior year and for which no substantial changes (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than one month) or closures have occurred during the period under consideration. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key _factors affecting our results of operations—Network sales” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our franchise activities—We rely on franchisees’ accurate reporting of their sales as a key performance indicator and the basis of calculation of fees owed by franchisees”._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the level of cash generated by the Issuer after payment of our net capital expenditure and income tax paid. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool. Free cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on free cash flow figures, free cash flow figures are unaudited and are not part of our accounting system. Free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the Issuer’s cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS. “Free cash flow conversion” is defined as (x) Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16 _minus_ (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid divided by (y) Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16. We believe that this ratio is a useful indicator of the level of cash generated by the Issuer after payment of our (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax, compared to our Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16. Free cash flow conversion is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to measures of liquidity of financial position as determined in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on free cash flow conversion, free cash flow conversion is unaudited and is not part of our accounting system. Free cash flow conversion is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, the Issuer’s cash flows as determined in accordance with IFRS. “Net capital expenditure” represents the sum of (i) purchases of intangible assets, (ii) purchases of property, plant and equipment and (iii) proceeds from disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the funds we use to acquire, upgrade, and maintain our physical assets, adjusted to reflect the depreciation and amortization of such assets. Net capital expenditure is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on net capital expenditure, net capital expenditure is unaudited and is not part of our accounting system.

The absence of such terminology does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, competition in areas of our business, outlook and growth prospects, strategies and the industry in which we operate.

In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this Offering Memorandum may not occur. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. We may face new risks from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks; nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to our management. We undertake no obligation, and do not expect, to publicly update or publicly revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"Founded by Mr. Alain Afflelou in Bordeaux in 1972, we are a leading optical product and hearing aid franchisor in Europe. We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both revenue and number of stores in France. ALAIN AFFLELOU is the third-largest optical business overall, with a 9.0% market share in 2023 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) in a fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers (according to Xerfi). In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network in Spain, our second core domestic market, where we had 368 stores as of April 30, 2024. We operated the largest optical product franchise network in Spain (in terms of number of stores) and were the fifth largest optical retail chain, with a 7.0% market share in 2023 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) (according to Xerfi). As of July 31, 2023, France, Spain and Other countries, our three geographic segments, represented 64.0%, 26.0% and 10.0%, respectively, of our total number of stores. The retail sale of optical products and hearing aids represented 92.8% and 7.2%, respectively, of our network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Building on our significant market share in our core geographic markets, France and Spain, we have grown our ALAIN AFFLELOU total store count to 1,434 stores as of April 30, 2024 compared to 1,397 as of April 30, 2023. In the past eleven years, we have grown our market share and maintained a leadership position in our key markets. Our growth is in part the result of market growth at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 2.7% and 2.4% in France and Spain, respectively, from calendar years 2019 to 2023 (according to GfK), as well as the performance of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand itself. Our intensive and long-term marketing and advertising efforts and campaigns (including our partnerships with key brand ambassadors) have also contributed to the success and power of our brand. In our two main secondary markets, Belgium and Switzerland, network sales for ALAIN AFFLELOU grew at a CAGR of 2.0% and 8.7%, respectively, from calendar years 2019 to 2023. We have been strategically adapting our store perimeter in recent years to increase profitability. We rely on our strong brand and large network of franchisees. Each additional store that we open allows us to benefit from economies of scale by spreading our fixed costs over a broader base of stores and sales potential. Such fixed costs include mainly the support costs of the network management, personnel costs and, among other things, administrative fees and structural costs, warehousing and inventory management costs, as well advertising and marketing costs relating to the promotion of our brand (which we believe will in turn benefit a larger number of stores and generate a greater volume of sales). The essential, health-care nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that may, at best, be sometimes delayed. We estimate that approximately 96.0% of our products are purchased by our customers as a result of a prescription or a medical need, namely: prescription glasses (82.0%), hearing aids (8.0%), contact lenses (6.0%). For example, at ALAIN AFFLELOU in France and Spain under both optical and hearing aids, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, 95.7% of network sales were generated by sales of glasses or hearing aids that are generally purchased with a prescription. According to 2024 data from Gallileo, 85.0% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing new glasses was the result of a medical need compared to 15.0% who indicated it was based on personal, non-health-related preferences. These dynamics create resilience and predictability in our sales as customers replace prescription products in regular and fairly short intervals (especially 1 ----- in countries where we benefit from a favorable regulatory framework whereby the majority of prescription products are reimbursed by social security and healthcare insurance providers, as is the case in France, our main market). In addition, these factors drive stable replacement cycles. For example, in France, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 2.8 years, which replacement cycle remained stable for the last ten years according to a report prepared by Advancy in 2022. In Spain, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 4.2 years, according to the same report. The rest of our sales result from discretionary purchases, such as sunglasses and optical and hearing aid accessories. Even in times of economic difficulty or pandemics, customers continue to buy and order glasses while our stores (which are classified as “essential” businesses, reflecting the healthcare-nature of the products we sell) remain open. Alternatively, customers may defer their purchase for only a short period of time. As a demonstration of this effect, after COVID-19 confinement periods, we observed a rebound in sales, which generally outperformed the same period in prior years, as customers caught up on overdue purchases for prescription glasses, lenses and hearing aids. We operate in highly attractive markets that are differentiated from traditional retail markets due to the largely non-discretionary and healthcare-related nature of optical and hearing aid expenses and a supportive healthcare reimbursement system in France. We believe that both the optical product and hearing aid markets are supported by positive structural drivers, including demographic trends, changing lifestyles, technological innovations, product penetration dynamics and value-adding product add-ons. In addition, our signature products are a key value differentiator, generating customer interest and good margins for us and our franchisees. The success of our franchisee-centered business model is demonstrated by the over-performance of our franchisees compared to the wider market: average revenue per store for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France for the 2021 calendar year was €0.9 million (including VAT), which is approximately 1.5 times the retail market average (and approximately 3.3 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store in 2021), and our average revenue per store in Spain for the calendar year ended 2019 was €0.4 million, which was approximately 2.1 times the retail market average in that year (and approximately 4.8 times the independent and smaller market group retailer store average in 2019), demonstrating the added value we offer to current and potential franchisees. Our strategy is based on strong branding, exclusive products, multi-possession, payment solutions and positive customer experience, and a multi-offer approach that reaches a variety of price points and target customers. ALAIN AFFLELOU offers a wide range of optical and hearing aid products, including our exclusive products, which consist of (i) signature label frames and sunglasses bearing the “Afflelou” signature; (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses; and (iii) other exclusive brands and third-party names. We connect with and understand consumers in our markets through our communications and marketing efforts, which have created a powerful and enduring brand image, as evidenced by our high brand awareness with customers in our main markets. Among optical retailers, we ranked first in terms of spontaneous and assisted awareness in France, second in terms of spontaneous awareness in Spain and first in assisted awareness in Wallonia (Belgium) and ranked second in assisted brand awareness among hearing aid retailers, according to various market studies conducted in 2018 and 2019. We also connect with consumers via our online presence. We began developing our online presence in 2012 and have progressively been incorporating our online initiatives under a unified digital umbrella. Currently we maintain websites in the languages of the principal countries where we operate. Additionally, in September 2016, we acquired two online pure players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com. We have incorporated the activities of Happyview.fr into our French Afflelou website. Malentille.com continues to serve customers on its own platform with back-end integration with the Group’s online activities. Our principal activity is to act as a franchisor, licensing the use of our brand to franchisees and providing them with the right to trade under our brand and implement our value proposition through our ----- commercial offers. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by (i) serving as flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations and large urban areas; (ii) helping to test new concepts; (iii) facilitating store network management; and (iv) generating high purchase volumes, which facilitates our negotiations with suppliers. Our services as a franchisor are aimed at helping franchisees grow their sales by fostering a strong brand image, driving customers to our stores through the design and promotion of our commercial offers and facilitating franchisee operations via a number of support services. Our scale and expertise yield tangible benefits to our franchisees, allowing us to offer (i) commercial support and innovation through new commercial offers and through high-impact national and local communication campaigns that create high brand awareness; (ii) access to central listing and purchasing unit services that lower costs for our franchisees; (iii) dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness, including assistance with location selection and store design; (iv) training programs designed to enhance sales performance; and (v) other general support functions, including legal, human resources and recruiting assistance, as well as assistance with joining care networks in France. Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our global network of stores. We also provide suppliers with distribution services, including a central listing and payment unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our franchisees, while offering the benefit of having a single counterparty for commercial negotiations and payments. We also support suppliers by actively promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directly-owned stores. Our franchise model combines: (i) revenue based on network sales of our franchisees (27.4% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023), (ii) revenue based on purchases (42.2% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023) and (iii) revenue generated by sales to end-customers in our directly-owned stores and through our websites (30.4% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023). Revenue based on network sales includes in particular: entry fees, franchise fees and communication fees, as well as other fees charged for services that we provide to our franchisees. Revenue based on purchases includes in particular: trading as well as central listing and payment unit (which are charged to our listed suppliers) and licensing fees and revenue from sales of our exclusive products. Revenue generated by our directly-owned stores mainly includes sales made directly to endcustomers in those directly-owned stores, as well as through our websites. This model not only provides us with revenue diversification but also increases our Adjusted EBITDA by increasing our network sales at limited fixed costs when opening new franchisee stores. This results in greater economies of scale and improved operating leverage and profitability. Our main costs are related to the supply and production of products that we sell under our own brands or for which we have a license. For our exclusive frames, Okia, a company based in China, has long been our favored intermediary. Okia is not a manufacturer but sources its products from a network of independent factories in Asia and allows the Group to benefit from optimal production conditions through this unique commercial relationship.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.1,We operate in resilient and predictable largely non-discretionary health-care related markets that benefit from established structural growth dynamics,"We operate in health-care related markets that benefit from established structural growth dynamics, namely: (i) an aging population and increased focus on wellness, (ii) an accrued use of screens and earphones, (iii) a stable replacement cycle for non-discretionary products, (iv) an under-equipment of the population in hearing aids and (v) a favorable regulatory and reimbursement framework, like in France, which is expected to drive increased demand for more products such as prescription glasses and hearing aids in the coming years. Our markets, different from traditional retail markets, are largely ----- non-discretionary and health-related, and therefore are more stable and predictable because as the aging population continues to grow so does the demand for our products. Consumers replace their glasses, contact lenses and hearing aids multiple times over their lifetimes and for a variety reasons, including for health reasons, such as changes in vision and hearing levels, as well as due to loss, damage, improved technology and changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. In addition, these factors drive stable replacement cycles. For example, in France, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 2.8 years, which replacement cycle remained stable for the last ten years according to a report prepared by Advancy in 2022. In Spain, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 4.2 years, according to the same report. As discussed further below in “—We sell essential health-related products, most of which _represent non-discretionary spending by our customers, making our business resilient and predictable”,_ most of our products are purchased because a customer has a health-related need, which distinguishes these products from traditional retail and consumer goods and creates relative resilience and predictability in our markets. The market for optical and hearing aid products in our core markets is large. These markets are also expanding as their populations age. According to INSEE, the French national statistics institute and INE, the Spanish national statistics institute, 46.9% and 50.5% of the French and Spanish populations, respectively, were 45 or older in 2023. Because eye and ear conditions, such as farsightedness and age-related hearing loss, usually develop after the ages of 40 and 55, respectively, and generally become more common and serious with age, the number of potential customers should increase as a consequence of the aging of the population in the countries in which we operate, with similar tailwinds benefitting both optical products and hearing aids. The optical product and hearing aid markets are also supported by other positive structural demographic trends and other growth levers, including changing lifestyles, technological improvements and product penetration dynamics. For example, we believe that evolving technology for corrective lenses and hearing aids, particularly improvements in multi-focal lenses and increasingly small microphones leading to smaller hearing aids, as well as shifting customer preferences as seen in increasing demand for custom lenses, leads consumers to replace old equipment. Penetration in the hearing aid segment is also expected to increase given the overall widespread presence of connected wireless headphones, limiting the negative preconceived image of hearing aid devices. In addition, there is greater demand for customized lenses or “progressive lenses”, which has led to increased average basket size, as well as “wellness” lenses such as blue light lenses. Increased diversified and complex needs have contributed to additional revenue. The below chart shows the increase in the proportion of progressive lenses purchased from 2012 to 2023 in France and Spain. _Source: GfK._ The French optical products market grew by a CAGR of 2.7% from 2019 to 2023, and the Spanish optical products market grew by a CAGR of 2.4% from 2019 to 2023, in each case according to GfK. The French hearing aid market has grown by a CAGR of 10.5% from 2019 to 2023, according to Xerfi ----- estimates. The chart below shows the evolution of the optical markets in France and Spain for the calendar years presented. _Source: GfK Optical market of France and Spain._ We expect to see accelerated growth in the hearing aid market, particularly in France, since the implementation of _100% Santé. Historically, hearing aids were an under-penetrated product class in our markets where in 2022 only approximately 46.0% of people in France who required hearing aids were equipped with them according to EuroTrak. This was largely due to the fact that hearing aids were prohibitively expensive, which led to patients delaying equipping themselves with such devices. In addition, historically, the public lacked general awareness of the effectiveness of the use of hearing aids. We expect to see significant long-term growth in the hearing aid market in France resulting from the partial correction of this historical under-penetration and further driven by the regulatory changes relating to RAC Zéro (the zero-cost to consumer offer under French regulation for hearing aids that went into effect in January 2021), which makes hearing aids significantly more affordable. We believe that many people who require hearing aids have delayed purchasing them because of the costs, especially prior to the implementation of the RAC Zéro scheme. We have benefited and continue to expect to benefit from a progressive equipment penetration in hearing aid sales as awareness of the effectiveness of hearing aids and knowledge of more discreet models of hearing aids spreads, and the public becomes more aware of the RAC Zéro changes and, in the long-term, we expect to benefit from RAC Zéro being replaced by individuals being able to purchase hearing aids through the French health-care system. The chart below shows the expected increase in adoption of the use of hearing aids in France for those with hearing loss from 2012 to 2027. _Sources: EuroTrak and Les Echos._ Hearing loss is an increasingly common and irreversible phenomenon that comes with aging and which is amplified by certain lifestyle choices, such as living in noisy environments or frequent use of headphones. The prevalence of hearing loss, which is estimated to impact around 10.0% of the population, according to a 2022 EuroTrak study, is positively correlated with the increasing population of people aged 65 and older, as well as with increasing levels of noise pollution. It is estimated that more than a quarter of the population of people aged 65 and over have some degree of hearing loss. ----- The changes brought by 100% Santé significantly increased the use of hearing aids in 2021, and as the chart above illustrates, penetration is expected to increase to 50.0% by 2027, representing an increase in our addressable market.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive strengths,9.2.2,"We sell essential health-related products, most of which represent non-discretionary spending by our customers and are underpinned by a supportive regulatory environment, making our business stable, predictable and well positioned to weather macroeconomic headwinds","The health-related nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that may, at best, be sometimes delayed but rarely deferred completely. Most of our products are purchased because a customer has a health-related need. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, 96.0% of network sales were generated by sales of products providing corrective vision or hearing, namely: prescription glasses (82.0%), hearing aids (8.0%), contact lenses (6.0%), and only 4.0% of network sales were generated by sales of items such as sunglasses and accessories which are not generally bought for a health-related needs. According to Gallileo, in 2024 85.0% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing new glasses was due to a need compared to 15.0% who indicated it was based on personal, non-health-related preference, at levels comparable with previous years. As the population continues to age, we expect customers to continue to purchase our products for health-related needs, which provides our business with stability, predictability and resilience. In addition, we have benefited and will continue to benefit from the supportive regulatory environment, making the purchase of healthcare related products, such as glasses and hearing aids, more accessible.

Our franchise business is our core activity and in terms of revenue and number of stores, we are the leading retail chain franchise network in France and a leading franchisor in continental Europe. As of July 31, 2023, our store network included 1,418 stores and generated network sales of €876.1 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The average length of our relationship for more than 50.0% of our total number of franchisees is ten years, and over 23 years for 17.0% of our total number of franchisees. Approximately 96.0% of our total number of franchisees in France remain year over year. We have developed our successful franchise model, which has particular, historical strength in the optical product sector, by combining the power of our brands with commercial innovations and close relationships with franchisees and suppliers. We believe this model sets us apart from our competitors. ----- Since 2003, we have successfully taken this differentiated operating model, which we have developed and refined with decades of experience in our core geographical and product markets, and rolled it out to other countries, as seen by our success in building our networks in Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg, in particular. We have historically had good results in rolling this model out in countries with French-speaking populations but believe this model also works well in non-French speaking countries and regions, as shown by the strength of our network in Spain. Since 2011 (except for 2013 to 2016, during which period the ALAIN AFFLELOU hearing aid business in France was operated by our shareholders outside of the Group), we have rolled this model out in the hearing aid markets in France, Spain and Switzerland, which works well across complementary product groups as well as across strategically-selected geographies as demonstrated by the graphs below. (1) Excluding Optical Discount. We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both revenue and number of stores and ALAIN AFFLELOU is the third-largest optical business, with a 9.0% market share in 2023 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) a fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers. In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network in Spain, our second core domestic market, where we had 363 stores as of July 31, 2023. In 2019, we operated the largest optical product franchise network in Spain in terms of number of stores and were the fifth largest optical retail chain, with a 7.0% market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) (according to Xerfi). In the hearing aid market, ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien has grown faster than the market average (with a CAGR of 18.0%, from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 compared to the market rate of approximately 9.0% over the period from the calendar years 2015 to 2023, as estimated by Xerfi) and held an approximately 3.0% market share in France in 2023 (according to Xerfi). Our hearing aid network in Spain has also grown rapidly in recent years, from 36 points of sale as of July 31, 2019 to 152 points of sale as of April 30, 2024. We believe we currently hold a 2.0% ----- market share in Spain (as estimated by Sra.Modne). We operate Alain Afflelou Acousticien with fundamentally the same sustainable business model as ALAIN AFFLELOU, including how contributions and fees are paid from franchisees. As a result, we believe that, over the long-term, profit levels at Alain Afflelou Acousticien will eventually converge with and stabilize at levels comparable to ALAIN AFFLELOU. Our business model is mature and well-developed, with a controlled fixed cost base such that, when sales increase, we benefit from economies of scale that drive higher margins. In addition, our franchise model combines multiple sources of revenue from both franchisees (comprising franchise fees (entry fees and royalty fees) and communication fees, as well as wholesale activity revenue from the sale of exclusive own-branded products and central purchasing unit revenue) and suppliers (comprising central listing and payment fees and license royalties). This approach provides us with revenue diversification and attractive margins, as demonstrated by our 13.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. We also leverage our directly-owned store network to manage, support and develop our franchise business. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by serving as flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations, helping to test new concepts, facilitating store network management and supporting negotiation with suppliers, through significant supply volumes. The success of our franchisee-centered business model is demonstrated by the over-performance of our franchisees compared to the wider market. Average revenue per store for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France for the 2021 calendar year was €0.9 million (including VAT), which is approximately 1.5 times the retail market average (and approximately 3.3 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store in 2021), and our average revenue per store in Spain for the calendar year ended 2019 was €0.4 million, which was approximately 2.1 times the retail market average in that year (and approximately 4.8 times the independent and smaller market group retailer store average in 2019). The over-performance of our franchisees has resulted in higher network sales growth rates in France and Spain as shown below. _Sources: Company Information, Xerfi and GfK._ The success of our business model is founded on our place at the center of the relationships among our suppliers, franchisees and customers, which brings value to each of these groups. For example, our scale and expertise generates multiple synergies and offers tangible benefits to our franchisees. Moreover, we provide our franchisees with commercial support and innovation through new commercial offers, including high-impact national and local advertising campaigns that create high brand awareness, access to central purchasing unit services that lower their costs, dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness (including assistance with location selection and store design), training programs designed to enhance sales performance and other general support functions, including human resources, recruiting assistance and financing assistance. Our signature products are another key value differentiator for our franchisees, generating customer interest, with affordable products that offer good margins, which benefit our franchisees as well as us. We support our franchisees with long-term commitments to their success, as demonstrated by how we help our franchisees adapt to change, such as through our Adelante financial support program (which we believe is a differentiator that few of our competitors are able to match), our Elite program (which is designed to assist franchisees that are underperforming), assistance with store refurbishments and support for adding hearing aid corners that make optical stores more attractive. As of July 31, 2023, ----- approximately 140 of our stores in Spain and France have benefitted from our Adelante financial support program. We are also there to help our franchisees face exceptional challenges. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we supported our franchisees in a variety of ways, including offering solutions that allowed them to defer an aggregate of €30 million in franchisee payables, in addition to €15 million of bank loans that we guaranteed. These have all been repaid by our franchisees and no amounts remained outstanding under these advances as at July 31, 2023. Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our large store network. We provide suppliers with distribution services, such as access to our central listing and payment unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our large network of franchisees. We also centralize payments from our networks to obtain optimal terms and facilitate credit management, to the benefit of these suppliers. We further support suppliers by jointly developing and actively promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directly-owned stores. We believe that this value-added approach creates stable and reliable relationships with our suppliers, which in turn drives cost-efficiency for us and makes us a more attractive partner to our franchisees.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

We are currently the third-largest market participant in France, with 9.0% of market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales), and the fifth-largest market participant in Spain, with 7.0% of market share (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) according to Xerfi. ALAIN AFFLELOU is positioned as a generalist optical and hearing aid retailer and includes “Alain Afflelou optical” and the “Alain Afflelou Acousticien” hearing aid business, which are now promoted together as “Alain Afflelou opticien & acousticien”. ALAIN AFFLELOU benefits from high brand awareness across our main geographies, consistently ranking number one in spontaneous or assisted awareness in France (as measured by Arcane, Galileo and Opinionway), number two in Spain (as measured by Punto de Fuga), and number two in the French-speaking regions of Belgium (as measured by CSA). We believe that we are well-positioned to maintain this market-leading brand awareness as these markets grow and evolve. We regularly receive awards for our offerings and our customer service. We have also won a number of industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer service provider of the year by the Elu service client de l’année (ESCDA) market survey, conducted by Viseo Customer Insights, in France for eight years in a row (2017 to 2024), best French optical franchise according to “Le Figaro _2024 Client Satisfaction Survey”, “Óptica del año” by Inma Stratmarketing for best optician in Spain in_ 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, “best franchise in shopping centre” by the Asociación Española de Centros _Comerciales in 2018 and “foreign franchise with the best implantation in the Spanish market” by the Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018, as well as for our television and video advertisements_ which customers easily recall. Some of our franchisees also won the award of best hearing aid and optical franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020 by the _Fédération des Réseaux Européens de _Partenariats et de Franchise (IREF)._ We have a long history of developing successful marketing and branding concepts, offers and products, such as Tchin Tchin (second pair of glasses for €1, launched in 1999), NextYear (payment in installments over 12 to 24 months, launched in 2009), Magic (innovative own branded frames with magnetic clips, launched in 2017), H2O (a model of exclusive sunglasses made from five bottles of recycled plastic recovered from the ocean, introduced in 2020) and more recently, CARACTERES, a middle-high range of fashion frames and sunglasses, which we believe help us grow and maintain our high levels of brand awareness, keeping our brand fresh and top of mind with new and potential customers. Where appropriate, we sometimes expand a brand concept across our product offerings, such as the introduction of Tchin Tchin to our hearing aid business in 2019 and the current implementation of tele-audiology, to complement the implementation of teleophthalmology in 2022. Finally, we regularly rank number one in the sector for innovative banner (as determined by Gallileo in ----- customer surveys from 2019 to 2024), and we held this ranking over the last two years as a result of the launch of our teleophthalmology solution in France. Our innovative banner is regularly recognized in the industry. For example, in November 2023, our teleophthalmology solution was awarded the “Innovative Retailer” Gold Medal at the 10th Nuit du Commerce Connecté.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Percentage of Optical Expenses Reimbursed in France,9.4.3,"Our business model is data-driven, flexible and tailored to our customers’ needs","We leverage our historical strength in the French and Spanish optical product markets and employ a generalist concept that operates not only in city centers but also in a growing number of stores in shopping centers and in retail parks to diversify our offering to respond to changing dynamics in our markets. To that end, we have developed (i) a multi-channel concept that is supported by the execution of a digital transformation plan that helps us tailor our customers’ experiences to their needs and preferences, while expanding our digital presence with “click-and-mortar” functionality, (ii) multiple store formats that respond to varied customer preferences while actively managing our store networks to adapt to evolutions in our markets and (iii) a complementary hearing aid business, grounded in standalone franchised stores as well as value-additive hearing aid corners within existing optical stores. We believe that this approach and these developments help us better serve our customers and our franchisees and in turn makes us an attractive partner for our suppliers. In recent years, we have invested deeply in digital transformation focused on developing forward-thinking, multi-format and fully-integrated customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools, which provide us and our franchisees with valuable data that allow us to better understand our customers and tailor our offerings to meet and anticipate their needs. We believe we are currently well-equipped to gather and analyze data from our franchisees, websites and directly-owned stores. On a daily basis, most of our franchisees provide us with sell-out data, which we use to understand customer behavior and to adjust our purchases based on evolutions in customer preferences. We believe that we are well-positioned to pivot from the investment phase of our digital transformation and CRM plan to a growth phase that puts this data to work for us and for our franchisees. We are also increasingly promoting the use of online bookings for in-store appointments, which reduces wait times, improves store efficiency and also helps to drive traffic into stores, with significant customer uptake on this value-added service in past year. This tool helps us to track and forecast flows in our business and to re-direct traffic as needed, creating more predictability for our stores and letting us offer a more personal experience to our customers. We have a presence in the online market for optical products, primarily for contact lenses. In addition, we have developed know-how for our existing online platform over the last several years. For example, we are present on social media (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok) and have developed apps and webtools that our customers can use to interact with our product offering, for example allowing them to book appointments, track their contact lens replacement cycle, to locate the nearest store or to virtually try on our frames. We have developed a comprehensive approach for our digital business consistent with our historical marketing positioning, in order to position ourselves as a leader, taking into account the relatively low e-commerce penetration in our sector. In parallel, we actively manage our store networks and store formats, using our expertise to identify changes in the market and to adapt our store locations, formats and sizes to meet demand and emerging opportunities, including through strategic relocations, adjustments to store sizes in city centers and development of larger store formats outside city centers. In recent years, a growing share of our franchised stores have been located in shopping centers and retail parks. We are optimistic that we will continue to be able to adapt our networks to meet customer demand going forward. As a result of the active management of our store network, the distribution of our stores between city centers, shopping centers and retail parks as of July 31, 2023 was 43.3%, 30.0% and 26.7%, respectively, compared to 54.2%, 32.1% and 13.8%, respectively, as of July 31, 2013. We are combining our historical optical business with a complementary hearing aid offering that responds to anticipated growth in demand supported by a new, supportive healthcare framework in France. ----- Since 2011 (except for 2013 to 2016, during which period the Alain Afflelou hearing aid business in France was operated by our shareholders outside of the Group), we have pursued a combined strategy through the creation of our complementary Alain Afflelou Acousticien business in the French and Spanish hearing aid markets. We have modelled the Alain Afflelou Acousticien strategy on our successful approach in the French and Spanish optical product markets, capitalizing on key success factors, such as our experience as a large franchisor, our strong brand awareness, our disruptive, price-focused approach and our history of commercial innovation, and leveraging our significant store network to develop cross-selling opportunities and synergies, such as through the opening of hearing aid corners within optical stores, and to expand our footprint in a cost efficient manner. We believe the _100% Santé changes in France have driven increased penetration in the currently underpenetrated_ French hearing aid market, where 46.0% of people had hearing impairments in 2022 (compared to less than 40.0% in Spain) according to Eurotrak, as these products are now significantly more affordable for those who need them but are not yet equipped or those who may need to replace their existing hearing aids. We believe our well-established business is poised to capture growth in this market, especially through the expansion of corners inside our tier-one locations in our optical network, in which we believe there is significant potential in the mid- to long-term.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Percentage of Optical Expenses Reimbursed in France,9.4.4,We have a robust financial track record with a high EBITDA to cash conversion ratio and fast- paced deleveraging as a result of an attractive margin profile and asset-light model,"Our business model, based on our highly-developed franchise business and asset-light, controlled fixed cost base that requires limited working capital and capital expenditure, drives our stable, healthy and predictable margins and cash generation. Our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of network sales was consistently above 12.0% from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 and in the twelve-month period ended April 30, 2024, in each case excluding Optical Discount. Over the same period, our free cash flow was consistently above 60.0%. Such free cash flow generation has given us the flexibility to apply free cash generated from operations to a variety of uses, including debt service and debt reduction. See “—Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Other Financial Measures—Group Profitability Measurements—Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16”._ The tables below show the evolution of our Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of network sales and cash flow conversion ratio from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 through the twelve months ended April 30, 2024. ----- _Source: Company Information._ (1) Excluding Optical Discount. (2) Reported fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA (including Optical Discount) was €100.7 million and reported fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA on network sales (including Optical Discount) was 11.9%. (3) Free cash flow conversion is defined as Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16 minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid) divided by Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16. (4) Fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 figures include Optical Discount perimeter. As a franchisor, we have built an asset-light model that requires limited capital expenditure to expand our networks, as almost all capital expenditures for the franchised stores in our networks are borne by our franchisees, who are responsible for their own store investments. From time to time, we support the expansion of the network through our Adelante program, whereby we lend funds, which generally do not exceed 25.0% of the total project, to our franchisees. We only bear the investment costs for our limited network of directly-owned stores, which also helps us keep our capital expenditure needs relatively low. These needs generally correspond to the maintenance of our directly-owned stores perimeter and the purchasing and selling of directly-owned stores on behalf of franchisors. Our financial performance is also bolstered by strong network sales at our ALAIN AFFLELOU network, which grew from €807.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to €876.1 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Our store count and network sales have benefited from the reputation of our franchise network, which encourages franchisees to open new stores and expand our store network. This growth was evidenced by the increase of our Adjusted EBITDA margins as a percentage of network sales to 12.0% for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2023 (on a post-IFRS 16 basis). We believe that strong network sales performance is a lever that can drive bottom-line improvement, particularly in ----- our hearing aids business and in our networks in countries that border our core markets, where we believe there is room to grow off the back of economies of scale driven by our franchise model and fixed cost base, as network sales growth generally requires limited expenses. Additionally, we have historically achieved strong cash flow generation and attractive free cash flow conversion dynamics, with a 69.4% free cash flow conversion rate for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, as a result of our limited capital expenditure needs. We also believe there are significant profitability upside opportunities from operating leverage within our developing businesses, such as our hearing aids business and our operations in countries that border our core markets. We also have limited working capital requirements, supported by the soundness of our network and quality of their payments. As a consequence, we believe the evolution of working capital, in the normal course of our business, is limited and mostly depends on seasonality of expenses such as communication or own exclusive products. For example as noted above, we provided financial assistance to our franchisees to help them weather the COVID-19 pandemic, which amounts were rapidly repaid by our franchisees. No amounts remained outstanding under these advances as from July 31, 2023. Finally, from time to time, we invest in innovation projects on behalf of the whole network, with a goal to accelerate the deployment of our innovation, like we did with teleophthalmology, or to foster the digital transformation. As a consequence, we successfully improved our cash and cash equivalents to €75.2 million as of July 31, 2023 (compared to €55.4 million as of July 31, 2022) and €105.0 million as of April 30, 2024. These factors contribute to a robust record of cash generation, strong free cash flow, free cash flow conversion and profitability. Our profitability combined with strong cash flow generation and limited capital expenditures needs and working capital requirements have allowed us to apply free cash flow to reduce our leverage: the ratio of our total net debt (post-IFRS 16) to our Adjusted EBITDA decreased from 5.2x as of July 31, 2021 to 4.8x as of July 31, 2023. We successfully refinanced our Group in 2021 for a total amount of €485 million, and issued additional notes for €50 million in 2022. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, we have further reduced our leverage from 5.2x as of July 31, 2022 to 4.8x as of July 31, 2023 and 4.4x as of April 30, 2024.

Our new CEO, Anthony Afflelou, appointed in June 2022, benefits from the support of his family and has a longstanding management team. Collectively, the members of our management committee have years of experience with the Group, and most have worked together as a team for many years and benefit from significant experience in the retail, optical and hearing aid industries, in addition to having a thorough understanding of the regulatory dynamics in the jurisdictions where we operate. The breadth of the experience of the management team, resulting in a 360 vision for the Group, constitutes a key driver of our strong performance. This longevity of our management committee members underscores our strength, bringing seasoned expertise and commitment to our vision.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Percentage of Optical Expenses Reimbursed in France,9.4.6,,"----- _Sources: Company information, Galileo 2024 and Advancy Report._ The COVID-19 pandemic and the recent inflationary period demonstrated strong indications of our resilience and ability to weather macroeconomic headwinds. According to GfK, the total optical market size in France was €7.4 billion in 2023 (excluding sales recorded outside of metropolitan France), compared to €6.7 billion in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic, and €5.9 billion in 2020 at the height of COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that even when certain of our stores closed due to COVID-19-related restrictions, the net result was that many purchases were either merely redirected to other stores in our network, rather than not being made or being deferred over the long-term, or were merely delayed until our stores reopened. As evidence of the latter, we observed a “catchup” effect whereby, when our stores reopened after COVID-19-related closures, we often saw customers making purchases that they had been planning or waiting to make during such closures. Additionally, measures aimed at curbing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic evolved favorably for our industry in our core geographies. For example, during the second confinement in France, which began in November 2020, the sale of optical and hearing aid products was deemed an “essential” service, in recognition of the non-discretionary healthcare needs addressed by these items, which generally allowed our stores to remain open (where not otherwise limited by other restrictions that are not specific to the optical and hearing aid sectors, such as those in place for large shopping centers in France). This represented a significantly improved operating environment for our industry compared to the more restrictive and exceptional confinement measures imposed in France during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the spring of 2020, when our stores were generally limited to providing “emergency” services.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.1,Increase our franchise network footprint in our domestic markets,"We intend to further develop our network through new franchised store openings in our domestic markets (France and Spain) within the ALAIN AFFLELOU business. We believe that there is still headroom to expand our Alain Afflelou network in France by more than 150 points of sale and 75 points of sale in Spain. We also believe we will be in a position to seize opportunities, both in terms of white space in the retail space that has emerged since the COVID-19 pandemic and due to more independent opticians being willing to join a larger banner. In past years, we have offered strong support to franchisees in order to expand our network, such as our Adelante program in France and Spain, which facilitates the opening and purchase of optical stores for new franchisees. We have also started to strengthen our communication toward professional and training programs for young opticians in order to attract new candidates. We also believe there are also several continued avenues for network optimization, including more actively managing our network and redeploying stores in order to capture more consumer traffic.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.2,Accelerate further expansion in hearing aid products in all existing markets,"We intend to continue our rapid expansion into the hearing aid market, with the aim of becoming a reference brand in this market. In France, we benefit from the _100% Santé changes, which make hearing aids significantly more affordable than they were previously. The 100% Santé changes were a disruption in the hearing aid market, resulting in a remarkable growth of approximately 85.0% in volume of devices sold in 2021, as reported by Snitem. Notwithstanding the current slowdown in the market (which was a consequence of the significant growth that we witnessed in 2021), we believe these regulatory changes will ultimately fuel growth in coming years, from 2025 onwards, as the sales volume of hearing aids will benefit from strong intrinsic growth driven by the public’s need for hearing aid devices. This need is largely due to an aging and growing population with a growing concern for hearing impairment, coupled with continued growth of hearing aid penetration rates and a supportive healthcare reimbursement system in France, which considerably improved with the implementation of 100% Santé. Including both hearing aids and optical products in the same stores generates synergies and crossselling opportunities. As of July 31, 2023, approximately 34.0% of our optical stores were equipped with hearing aid corners, compared to 20.0% as of July 31, 2019. Our combined offering also provides consumers with the convenience of acquiring both products at a single location, based on the fact that there is substantial overlap in the population seeking vision correction and the population seeking hearing aids. On the other hand, both opticians and hearing aid specialists in our network also benefit from these synergies, with opticians welcoming new potential clients under the hearing aid offers and hearing aid specialists benefiting from premium locations inside our optical network and a better management of the flow of customers with the support of the opticians on site. In the past five fiscal years and the nine months ended April 30, 2024, opticians welcoming a hearing aid corner inside their optical store have witnessed an average outperformance of 2% compared to the rest of our network. The below table shows how our hearing aid business has expanded from the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 to the three months ended April 30, 2024. ----- _Source: Company information._ The strong growth of our hearing aid businesses has contributed to growth of our network sales (excluding Optical Discount) at a CAGR of 3.6% during the periods shown below. _Source: Company Information._ (1) Excluding Optical Discount. Additionally, we believe that our strong brand equity will benefit from the growth of each network. This was observed after the re-launch of hearing aids in Spain during the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2023, where total like-for-like sales grew 88.4% and 92.8%, respectively. We continue to focus on optimizing these synergies and have favored expansion of our hearing aid business through corners inside optical stores. Our hearing aid corners are a key growth lever for us, as we believe the hearing aid market is well-poised for significant growth. We believe there is significant upside to putting hearing aid corners in our franchisees’ existing optical stores, as the two businesses are complementary and we believe that these hearing aid corners drive like-for-like growth in sales of glasses. Our model envisions franchisees who wish to enter the hearing aids business operating their dedicated optical stores alongside two to three hearing aid corners. We believe this approach is a natural fit for many of ----- our franchisees, particularly for those who are dually-qualified as opticians and audiologists, as well as for those who aim to expand their existing competency to cover audiology as well as optical services. As of July 31, 2023 (excluding Optical Discount), we had 276 hearing aid corners inside 808 optical stores in France, 119 hearing aid corners inside 355 optical stores in Spain (where we prioritized the opening of hearing aid corners inside optical stores to drive our expansion in this region) and seven hearing aid corners in Belgium. Finally, we believe that using the same model in our hearing aid business as we do in our optical business will generate economies of scale in the future and help us to generate favorable levels of profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.3,Further penetrate the European market in border countries and continue to expand in other international areas,"We have a well-established and expanding presence in countries that are adjacent to our core markets of France and Spain, having successfully expanded ALAIN AFFLELOU into Belgium (1998), Luxembourg (2002), Switzerland (2005) and Portugal (2008), respectively managing 50, five, 20 and 23 stores as of April 30, 2024. We believe that these “border” markets collectively represent millions of potential end-customers and thus present a significant potential growth opportunity for us, as these are familiar markets to us where we already have a fairly mature base, where we can roll-out the same operating model we use in France and Spain and where we benefit from built-in brand awareness. We intend to further extend our European footprint in these border countries (i.e. Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Portugal) by deepening our franchise network. In both Belgium and Switzerland, we are mainly present in French-speaking regions and we are seeking to grow our presence in Dutch-speaking regions of Belgium and German-speaking regions of Switzerland, which represent large markets in each of these countries. In Portugal, we are currently reviewing our strategy to expand beyond our existing base. We continuously evaluate potential targets for strategic acquisitions, particularly in such border countries. We also believe there are opportunities in the Middle East, where we see room to grow, as well as in Africa, where there is an increasing middle class, as well as a growing population with more disposable income, and especially in African countries that have a historical link with France, like Morocco, where we currently have 22 franchised stores as at April 30, 2024. We believe that our franchise model adapts well to various geographies, languages and types of markets.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.4,"Drive organic growth through market independence with our own brand, innovation and digitalization","Our digital transformation is underpinned by the following six pillars: (1) Our ability to gather and analyze data through our CRM tools to better meet the needs of our end customers. (2) Our interactions with end customers through digital tools such as campaigns, online appointments, text messages, emails, digital reminders, and ratings on Google. (3) Our ability to optimize our communications with our customers as a result of better knowledge of our customers’ needs and utilizing social networks and digital communication. (4) Our continued improvement of the in-store customer journey through digital tools such as virtual try-ons and interactive screens, as well as tablets to improve customer interaction during the sale of our products. ----- (5) Our ability to deploy a first-mover offer in teleophthalmology and teleaudiology solutions. (6) Our continued focus on maintaining our online sales. Our digital transformation plan relies on a data-centric approach, in which we have made significant investments and have achieved notable success in recent years. We have a large customer database and have put in place strong support system from our franchisees and links with their point-of-sale systems, which we believe helps us to offer better service to customers. We believe that continuing to implement our digital transformation plan, including by optimizing our existing framework and rolling out new tools will help us increase the loyalty of our existing clients and as well as to attract new clients. Part of our digital transformation plan also involves the roll-out of digital screens, tablets and other innovative tools that are aimed at improving the customer experience in the store. Through our Orchestra program, we are providing our franchisees a complete solution to manage interactions with their end customers, beginning from the purchase of glasses in our stores. On the communication side, we also intend to continue growing our leading presence on various social media platforms, as a growing part of our total communication efforts. Finally, we intend to strengthen the multi-channel experience we offer to our customers. We currently have a “click-and-mortar” approach that allows customers to explore our products online and also test them through our virtual try-on session before ultimately buying products in one of our stores. Through our online offers at Afflelou.com and Malentille.com, we also continue to serve customers online. Customer surveys regularly identify our brand as a leader in terms of innovation. As such, we have started to deploy teleophthalmology in the ALAIN AFFLELOU in France, of which 121 were active as of April 30, 2024. The teleophthalmology solution at ALAIN AFFLELOU provides an alternative for glasses wearers to resolve the shortage of ophthalmologists, which is partly due to _numerus clausus for this profession, through a direct virtual consultation conducted by health professionals (orthoptists and ophthalmologists) in a dedicated space at the franchisees’ premises. The stores which have deployed teleophthalmology have witnessed a 5.7% outperformance of the rest of our network as we believe they bring an obvious benefit to people with vision impairment, who are facing growing difficulties to get a prescription for glasses, and are generally keen on simplifying the process to equip with glasses. We believe our teleophthalmology solution is a strong innovation in our sector, differentiating us from other businesses and bringing a large benefit for glasses wearers in a context of a shortage of ophthalmologists, especially in more rural areas. We are also currently testing the deployment of a similar telemedicine solution for our hearing aids business, with the aim to bring a solution to the shortage of ENT specialists, which impacts this market. On top of our innovative strategy, we are actively involved in the deployment of our own branded collections such as our Magic collection, which differentiates us from the rest of the industry.

We believe these services increase customer satisfaction and improve performance in our stores, which are key drivers of our financial performance. We will continue to extend a variety of services that we have put in place in recent years, like training (including e-training) for our franchises and dedicated support such as our Elite program, which is designed to assist franchisees that are underperforming. Additionally, we intend to continue our rollout of a multi-offer approach, converting existing franchisees into operators under both our optical and hearing aid businesses, such as by ----- encouraging optical franchisees to add hearing aid or sunglasses corners in their stores. We believe that our strong focus on cultivating and promoting our franchisee-centered business model will continue to support robust levels of revenue per store in France and Spain, which have historically outperformed independent retailers’ levels of sales.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Strategy,9.5.6,Continue to deliver operating efficiencies at Group-level and generate network synergies,"We intend to continue to take advantage of the economies of scale provided by our network organization by streamlining our administrative and overhead functions and controlling our cost base. For instance, we have regrouped our various administrative locations in France at one site in Paris. We intend to continue evaluating the performance of our store network, with a view to optimizing such performance. We will also continue to carefully monitor our directly-owned stores network, with a long-term target of maintaining a limited directly-owned stores perimeter, while acting opportunistically where we believe there is low-risk potential. In France, we plan to reduce our directly-owned stores perimeter, limiting this perimeter to stores located in the Paris region, and to stores which either (i) require significant expenses due to their location and size (for example, large stores generally located in large shopping centers for which rents can often represent more than €150,000 per year) or (ii) have a strong impact on our overall image (flagship stores). In addition, we aim to dispose of isolated stores where our footprint of directlyowned stores is limited, and keep geographical clusters, such as in Lyon, Bordeaux and Marseille. We plan to sell any stores that do not correspond to these criteria to our franchisees. Notwithstanding these strategic reductions, we plan to continue to leverage our directly-owned stores in managing our wider network, operating flagship stores, and in our negotiations with suppliers. We also intend to continue our advertising efforts to support the development of our network as we did in Spain in the past fiscal year through a specific communication budget to support the relaunch of the hearing aid network. We will more generally continue to prioritize and fund significant communication campaigns, which for instance have been set at 8.76% of franchisees’ sales in France in July 2022, while leveraging our economies of scale to manage overall communication expenses. In particular, we believe that the rapid growth of our hearing aid business will generate a benefit to the brand equity of ALAIN AFFLELOU. We will also grow the synergies between the two complementary businesses, which share the same customer approach and the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand image, through the corners inside our optical stores. We are currently focused on generating synergies, through our Boost program, which aims at growing cross fertilization, alongside the expansion of our hearing aid network inside our optical stores network. In addition, we intend to continue leveraging our long-standing relationships with suppliers to obtain the most favorable commercial terms for our store network. Savings generated from these discounts or rebates are shared with franchisees. Finally, we believe that expanding in border countries and growing our hearing aid business will help us increase profitability due to both gains in communication margins and the growth of exclusive products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

We produced our first carbon footprint report in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, and we are currently defining our trajectory for a CO2 emissions reduction plan. In addition, we are also involved in waste reduction, and recycling glasses and hearing aids products which are delivered in our network. We intend to support the optimization of our supply chain including logistics matters that are aimed at reducing CO2 emissions or favor processes such as cut-edged and premounted glasses which can deliver significant levels of CO2 emissions savings. ----- (ii) Consider the health dimension of our business with our foundation to grant assistance to populations in need of glasses and hearing aid devices where the government provides lower protection. In addition, in some cases (such as in our teleophthalmology initiative) we aim to facilitate access to health professionals in so-called “medical deserts” where access to health professionals is lacking. (iii) Provide greater support to our franchisees through training. In addition, we aim to grow our Adelante financial support program to provide opportunities to young opticians and audioprosthetists to become entrepreneurs and benefit from career opportunities which they could not otherwise access without such support. These pillars are conducted alongside our internal efforts to align our business to the European Union’s Education of Social Responsibility objectives. In addition, we adhere to the United Nations’ Global Compact in July 2022 and we have also established a series of initiatives internally, with our own employees, to favor diversity and inclusion.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

(3) “Net interest expense” is defined as the sum of net interest paid and interest paid on lease liabilities as defined in the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Issuer. For a full breakdown of its constituent components, see note 6.1.7 to the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The net interest expense for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 was calculated as the net interest expense for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 plus the net interest expense for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 less the net interest expense for the nine months ended April 30, 2023. (4) “Total senior debt” refers to the sum of the nominal amounts of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and Existing Subordinated Notes (which does not take into account (i) the IFRS impact of amortized issuance costs and (ii) accrued interest). (5) “Total debt (post-IFRS 16)” refers to total senior debt plus IFRS 16 lease liabilities (net of sublease arrangements). For further information on our sublease arrangements, see note 6.2.5.3 to the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 for a presentation of our sublease liabilities and note 6.2.3.3 to the Issuer’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 for a presentation of our sublease receivables (equal to sublease liabilities), in each case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our sublease liabilities for the nine months ended April 30, 2023 was €18.4 million. (6) “Total net debt post-IFRS 16” refers to total debt (post-IFRS 16) minus cash and cash equivalents as appearing on our balance sheet. For further information on our sublease arrangements, see note 6.2.5.3 to the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 and for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 for a presentation of our sublease liabilities and note 6.2.3.3 to the Issuer’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 for a presentation of our sublease receivables(equal to sublease liabilities), in each case included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our sublease liabilities for the nine months ended April 30, 2023 was €18.4 million. (7) **“Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16” refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as adjusted to remove the effect of IFRS 16, mainly related to the interest component of lease liabilities and depreciation of right-of-use assets which under IFRS 16 are treated as a finance cost or depreciation of assets. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, see note 4.6 to our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statement for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 and notes 5.3 to our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, each included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. (8) “Net capital expenditure” represents the sum of (i) purchases of intangible assets, (ii) purchases of property, plant and equipment and (iii) proceeds from disposal of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the funds we use to acquire, upgrade, and maintain our physical assets, adjusted to reflect the depreciation and amortization of such assets. Net capital expenditure is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS. While we review and conduct control procedures on net capital expenditure, net capital expenditure is unaudited and is not part of our accounting system. Net capital expenditure is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this measure in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, any of the Issuer’s financial measures determined in accordance with IFRS. (9) “Free cash flow” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16 minus (i) net capital expenditure and (ii) income tax paid. We believe that this additional measure is a useful indicator of the level of cash generated by the Issuer after payment of our net capital expenditure and income tax paid.

The incremental EBITDA contribution estimated from these stores is based on average full-year network sales by similar stores, less actual network sales generated from these stores for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, and estimated Adjusted EBITDA margins as a percentage of network sales for similar stores; and (ii) an estimated full-year EBITDA contribution of €0.8 million from 39 franchised stores opened or expected to be opened in France and Spain between May 1, 2024 and July 31, 2024. The full-year EBITDA contribution estimated from these stores is based on average full-year network sales and estimated Adjusted EBITDA margins as a percentage of network sales for similar stores less (iii) the actual Adjusted EBITDA contribution of €0.4 million from 26 franchised stores closed in France and Spain during the twelve months ended April 30, 2024. (b) This adjustment normalizes our DOS network activity for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024, by aggregating the following (i) to neutralize the direct negative Adjusted EBITDA contribution of 10 DOS in France and Spain closed (of which six were Optical Discount stores) and 24 DOS sold or transferred to franchisees during the period and adding back such stores’ contribution to headquarters costs _plus, where relevant, adding back the EBITDA effect of any DOS transferred to franchisees and (ii) to normalize the ramp-up period of 19 DOS opened during the period, the negative EBITDA contribution associated with the initial operation of the DOS is removed.

The summary historical consolidated financial information in the tables below is derived from the Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 prepared in accordance with IFRS and from the Issuer’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the nine months ended April 30, 2023, prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the standard of IFRS as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial statements, English translations of which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were subject to an audit by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer’s statutory auditors for those years. The Issuer’s unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, which include the unaudited comparative financial information for the nine months ended April 30, 2023, were subject to a limited review by Ernst & Young et Autres and Deloitte & Associés, the Issuer’s statutory auditors for such period.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.1,Risks related to macroeconomic conditions,"_We are exposed to macroeconomic and other macro trends that could diminish demand for our products._ Our principal domestic markets are France and Spain, which represented 64.0% and 26.0%, respectively, of our stores as of July 31, 2023. Additionally, France and Spain generated 76.2% and 16.1%, respectively, of network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. As a result, we are particularly influenced by economic developments in France and Spain and a significant economic downturn in either country could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our franchise operations elsewhere indirectly expose us to economic trends in those countries because our franchisor revenue is related in part to the level of franchisee sales, which are subject to local economic conditions, among other things. Insofar as we expand into other countries and territories, we will become exposed to economic conditions in such regions. Macroeconomic trends can have a significant impact on consumer discretionary spending and some of our products are perceived as more discretionary than others. For example, purchases of nonprescription sunglasses could decline during periods in which disposable income is lower or in periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. Discretionary spending is affected by many factors, including general economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, consumer debt levels, unemployment rates, availability of consumer credit, currency exchange rates and other matters that influence consumer confidence. Many of these factors are outside of our control. For more information about macroeconomic trends, see “Industry—Market Drivers”. Expenses related to our other products, namely corrective lenses, frames and contact lenses are generally less discretionary and are consequently less dependent on macroeconomic indicators. However, during a period categorized by difficult economic conditions, we believe that customers may delay the purchase or replacement of optical products and hearing aids or opt to purchase less expensive models (for example, plastic frames which generally carry lower selling prices than acetate frames or lenses without scratch-resistant or anti-reflective coatings). These effects may be more significant in countries where the level of reimbursement by public and/or private insurance systems is comparatively low, which is the case for most of the markets in which we carry out our activities, save for our largest market, France. For example, the optical retail market in Spain, which is our second home market in terms of network sales and where optical products are not reimbursed by the public health system and/or private insurance systems, was significantly affected by macroeconomic 38 ----- difficulties from 2008 to 2013, thus negatively impacting the pace of our development in this country during that time period. A portion of our franchisor revenue is directly related to our network sales as royalties or communication fees that we receive are calculated as a percentage of our network sales. In addition, other revenue streams are indirectly linked to our network sales, including listing fees paid by suppliers and calculated on the basis of store purchases, and margins retained in connection with our purchasing and trading activities. Any deterioration in macroeconomic conditions in France, Spain or the other markets in which we carry out our activities or into which we decide to expand may result in short- and long-term decreases in consumer disposable income and demand, may lead to lower overall Group network sales or to changes in the mix of products that we sell in ways that may impact our overall profitability and which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our performance is subject to our ability to adapt to evolving customer tastes and preferences._ Consumer purchasing decisions regarding optical and hearing aid products are generally influenced by highly subjective factors, including fit, style, brand and durability. The tastes and preferences of customers in terms of optical and hearing aid products are subject to change based on demographics and fashion, lifestyle and other trends. Fashion and aesthetic considerations, technical and technological advances, as well as increased health and well-being awareness, have had and are likely to continue to have a significant effect on consumer purchasing decisions and on the type of products offered and sold by us and our franchisees. While our individual stores may offer a customized selection (ordered via our listing and payment unit) of frames and hearing aids that they believe correspond best to customer demand, the optical products and hearing aids that we offer and/or make available to stores in our networks may not reflect the needs, tastes and preferences of customers. As a result, the offering of such products by us and our franchisees may fail to meet customers’ expectations or respond to customer demand. This risk is particularly acute as we focus most of our marketing efforts on our ownbranded products which, if they are unsuccessful in attracting customer interest, could lead to reduced sales volumes. In addition, the commercial offers and advertising campaigns that we launch may not appropriately target potential customers. In order to cater to evolving customer tastes and preferences, we continuously monitor our stores and websites and make strategic decisions to adjust our product offering, open, close or refurbish stores, revise store concepts and layouts and expand or enhance our websites. However, we may not be able to anticipate and implement decisions regarding our stores or websites with sufficient speed or efficacy and our product offering and the location, concept and layout of our stores and websites may not correspond to customers’ needs and tastes. For more information about consumers’ preferences, see “Industry—Market Drivers”. Failures and delays in responding to customer tastes and demands or in optimizing our stores and websites could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _A regional or global health pandemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may_ _materially negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control._ Public health crises, epidemics or pandemics could materially adversely affect our business. For example, in late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. These measures adversely affected workforces, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of confinements, led to an economic downturn in our markets and had a direct impact on our business across all of the countries in which we operate. In March 2020, the governments of the countries in which we operate imposed significant confinement measures in order to control the spread of COVID-19 and, in doing so, required the ----- temporary closure of the vast majority of our stores and, as a result, almost all our revenues ceased until the phased reopening of our stores in May and June of 2020. Resurgences (or “waves”) of COVID-19 subsequently occurred in late 2020, spring 2021 and early 2022. Such waves resulted in either the implementation of certain restrictive measures on our operations or otherwise presented difficulties in the management of our day-to-day business, such as at the beginning of the 2022 calendar year, when many employees at our franchisees and at our directlyowned stores tested positive with COVID-19 and could not perform their expected roles, such as running retail stores and servicing their customers. While COVID-19 related restrictive measures have now all been lifted, new waves of COVID-19 may continue to occur, which may prompt new government restrictions. We cannot predict when or where these waves will occur, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local confinements or other measures implemented by the governments and/or local or regional authorities of the countries in which we operate. The effect of a resurgence of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic on our business and industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak, the impact on the global economy (which can impact demand and pricing of our products), the length of time it takes for demand and pricing to return and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume. To the extent COVID-19 or any other pandemic or public health emergency has an adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described herein, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.2,Risks related to the French healthcare system,"_We are exposed to risks relating to the reimbursement framework in France._ The demand for our products in France, which is our principal market, representing 76.2% of our network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, is directly impacted by the level of reimbursement provided by the French public health system and/or under private insurance policies offered by complementary health insurance companies (Organismes complémentaires d’assurance maladie “OCAMs”). Reimbursement received from the public health system accounts for a small fraction of the total reimbursement received by customers, particularly for optical products, with the remainder being reimbursed by OCAMs and borne by the customer. Nonetheless, the public health system plays a significant role in the optical product market as reimbursement by OCAMs is conditional upon reimbursement by the public health system. Any decrease in the level of reimbursement for optical and hearing aid expenses that customers obtain from either the public health system or OCAMs would negatively impact their spending power. For example, one important characteristic of an OCAM contract is whether it is deemed “responsible” by the French public health authorities and thus qualifies for favorable tax treatment. OCAM contracts are deemed “responsible” if they comply with a number of criteria, including, as of April 1, 2015, the imposition of minimum and maximum thresholds on reimbursements of optical products. The maximum reimbursement threshold for qualification as “responsible” has been set at €800 for a pair of glasses. In general, the legislation provides that the maximum price for a pair of glasses with unifocal lenses is set at €420 (the exact maximum price depends on prescription strength) and for a pair of glasses with multifocal lenses at €800 (the exact maximum price depends on prescription strength) and, in each case, including a maximum of €100 per frame irrespective of the type of lenses used. Other regulatory changes may impact us. For example, under Decree no 2014-1374, the maximum replacement frequency for glasses was changed from one to two years (other than for children or in case of a change in prescription or breakage) in 2014. ----- The 100% Santé measures, which are aimed at improving access to and reducing costs of healthcare products such as glasses and hearing aids for end consumers, impact us. The main aspects of the _100% Santé measures, which started in January 2020 in the optical sector, are:_ - a “zero consumer cost” (RAC Zéro) offer, which consists of a basic “basket” for unifocal and multifocal glasses (set at approximately €100 and €195, for the most common unifocal and for multifocal glasses with thin, anti-reflective lenses, respectively). All opticians are required to make this offer available, offering customers a minimum range of 17 frames for adults and 10 frames for children, each to be available in two different colors (i.e. a total of 54 frames). The customers in this RAC Zéro offer can choose the full RAC Zéro (i.e. for glasses and frames or one of the two). Every quote to customers must include a zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer. The basket for frames is set at a maximum of €30; - a reduction in the reimbursement cap used by private health insurers to €100 for frames compared to the previous cap of €150 and as contrasted with an average cost for frames of €139 (for unifocal lenses) and €161 (for multifocal lenses), according to a 2023 Gallileo survey; and - the option for opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by French public health insurance, for approximately €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago. In the hearing aid sector, similar discussions have also been conducted and the zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer for hearing aids has been set more progressively (€1,300 in 2019 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with a co-pay from the customer), €1,100 in 2020 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with a co-pay from the customer) and €950 in 2021 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with no co-pay from the customer)). In its 2023 report on the hearing aid market, Arcane estimated an average price of €1,557 for a hearing aid device in 2023 compared to €1,497 in 2019 and €1,565 in 2016. Further, the out-of-pocket cost of hearing aids was estimated to be €742 in 2019 compared to €1,069 in 2016 according to Arcane. These costs further declined to €542 in 2023 according to the same Arcane report, as a result of the implementation of RAC Zéro in 2021. As in the optical market, there is, on one hand, a higher proportion of value-added products (such as, in-ear devices and remote headphones), and, on the other hand, the increased offering of reasonably priced devices and, since January 2021, the ability for end customers to acquire a RAC Zéro hearing aid device valued up to €950 without any out-of-pocket expense. For more information about reimbursement schemes in France, see “Regulation—France—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system”. The impact of such regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. See “—Specific _risks related to our hearing aid business—The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is particularly important for sales of our hearing aids in_ _France” and “—Risks related to legal and regulatory matters—Risks related to laws and regulations—We operate in a highly regulated business environment and predicting legal and regulatory changes or developments is difficult”._ The French Health authorities have put in place new guidelines to promote the adoption of 100% Santé in the hearing aid and optical markets, with a goal to expand the implementation of 100% Santé among health professionals, especially in the optical sector. In the middle of 2022, the penetration of _100% Santé_ in the optical sector was estimated by the French Health authorities to be only approximately 16.0% compared to approximately 38.0% in the hearing aid sector. In June 2023, the French Government announced a new plan that would allow opticians who sell more than 65.0% of their glasses through the 100% Santé program to receive a reimbursement of €42 per pair of glasses sold. _We may be materially disadvantaged by the significant influence of care networks in France._ Care networks act as intermediaries between OCAMs and healthcare professionals, including opticians and audio prosthetists. Care networks may be “open”, admitting all professionals who satisfy certain criteria defined by the care network, or “closed”, which limit the number of healthcare professionals able to join the care network. OCAM members are often incentivized to go to opticians that have joined the care network affiliated with their insurance provider, because they are likely to be reimbursed at a higher ----- rate than they would be at an optician that is not a member of a care network that is affiliated with their insurance provider. Additionally, OCAMs increasingly require that customers purchase optical and hearing aid products from a store that has joined a care network in order to benefit from third-party payment, i.e., the reimbursement of optical and hearing aid expenses made by the relevant OCAM through direct payment to the optician or audio prosthetist. In 2023, according to Gallileo, 68% of glasses wearers were covered by an OCAM using a care network and 30% actually used an optician recommended by that OCAM’s care network, at comparable levels with past years. Customers and OCAMs are making greater use of care networks, which exercise significant influence on how optical products and hearing aids are reimbursed in France. In particular, membership in care networks may affect our commercial strategy as prices and standards may be strongly influenced by such care networks. Certain care networks may impose limits on which suppliers we may use and which products we may offer, sometimes even requiring the purchase of such care network’s own products. The increasing influence and negotiating power of care networks, as well as the increasing share of the population whose health insurance is covered by an OCAM that has joined a care network, may also lead to a general decline in prices of optical products and hearing aids in the long term in France due to care networks’ willingness to be more attractive to OCAMs by selecting optical and hearing aid retail stores offering products at lower prices, thus potentially reducing the levels of reimbursement made by OCAMs and consequently healthcare professionals’ margins and profits. Our store network in France was previously underrepresented in care networks, as we discouraged our franchised stores from joining such care networks prior to 2014. Since then, our networks have been actively joining such care networks, with support provided by the Group to franchisees who wish to join such care networks. We believe we are now well-situated with respect to membership of our franchised stores in the care networks. The operations of stores in our network in France that have not already joined a care network may be adversely impacted as customers are incentivized to go to optical retail stores that are members of their care network where they will be able to benefit from a higher level of reimbursement. There also can be no guarantee that franchisees in our network who are not currently part of a care network will be admitted in the future or that our franchisees’ membership in care networks will be maintained. As a consequence, our franchisees could lose market share among those care networks or could be affected by tighter conditions in the new partnerships, which could have an adverse effect on our franchisor business. For more information about care networks in France, see “Regulation—France—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system”. _The demand for our products may be adversely affected by the growing shortage of ophthalmologists, qualified opticians, ear, nose and throat (“ENT”) specialists and audio prosthetists in France._ Unlike other countries, where optometrists may conduct routine eye examinations and prescribe corrective lenses and contact lenses, only ophthalmologists are generally permitted to prescribe corrective lenses in France. Individuals need to have a valid prescription from an ophthalmologist in order to buy glasses, except in certain limited circumstances where, since the implementation of 100% _Santé, opticians can deliver glasses following an eye examination and opticians have the ability under_ such prescriptions to perform eye exams, adapt ophthalmologist prescriptions, if necessary and deliver glasses. The role of orthoptists has also been strengthened given that they can, since Decree no. 2022-691 of April 26, 2022, issue original prescriptions for optical equipment under certain conditions (in particular to patients between the ages of 16 and 42 who do not have any of the medical contraindications provided by the decree). The ability of the opticians and orthoptists to prescribe optical equipment remains limited and there is a limited number of ophthalmologists in France. Customers generally have to wait a significant period of time, before securing an appointment with an ophthalmologist and obtaining a new prescription for optical products. As a result, we believe that the limited number and growing shortage of ophthalmologists affects both the demand for and number of purchases of optical products by customers in France. Notwithstanding recent increases to the numerus _clausus for this profession, measures to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a prescription from an_ ophthalmologist provided within five years, and initiatives intended to facilitate the process for glasses wearers (like tele-ophthalmology currently deployed by our Group), we believe that this growing shortage may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. ----- Similarly, the demand and number of purchases of hearing aid devices by customers in France may be affected by the growing shortage of ENT specialists. The current shortage of ENT specialists, and its negative impact on the sale of our hearing aid devices, may be further accentuated as from September 2022, generalist doctors in France are no longer entitled to prescribe hearing aid devices unless they have completed specific medical otology training. Since roughly 20% of first-time hearing aid prescriptions in France were prescribed by generalist doctors (according to a survey conducted by Synea), this could continue to reduce the number of hearing aid prescriptions given to patients in France, which could negatively impact demand for hearing aid devices. Further, while in France glasses and hearing aids are prescribed by ophthalmologists and ENT specialists, respectively, patients must be subsequently fitted with glasses and hearing aids by a qualified optician or a qualified audio prosthetist, respectively. Having observed delays for glasses and hearing aids as a result of this system and the limited number of qualified professionals available to service individuals seeking glasses or hearing aids, we believe that there is an insufficient number of opticians and hearing aid specialists in France, our principal market. Despite the increase in the overall number of graduated opticians and audio prosthetists in past years, we believe that such shortages will continue in the future due to the significant shortage generated in the past and associated backlog. Accordingly, we believe that such shortages may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, and in particular could affect our and our franchisees’ ability to hire the adequate health professionals to open and run points of sales.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.3,Risks related to our franchise activities,"_Our revenue may decrease significantly if our franchisees do not generate sufficient sales or if current or former franchisees use our know-how and commercial offers similar to ours to our detriment._ Our revenue depends on our franchisees’ ability to generate sales from the operation of their stores. As of July 31, 2023, 87.9% of stores in our networks were operated by franchisees and our franchisor activities generated 69.6% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. We occasionally terminate franchise contracts, leading to the closure of certain franchised stores. Although most terminations of our franchise agreements have historically been made following a franchisee’s failure to implement our commercial policies or for non-payment or due to poor performance or inadequate location of the store, the closure of franchised stores may adversely affect our reputation and reduce the amount of franchisor fees and commissions we receive from franchisees. We may also face competition from our former franchisees. In the event of non-renewal or termination of a franchise agreement, a former franchisee may decide to conduct business as an independent optician or join a competing network following the expiry or breach of the one-year non-compete clause, included in the franchise agreement. In addition, a disgruntled franchisee may decide to share our knowhow or other confidential information with persons outside the Group, including with the press. As all franchisees benefit from our know-how and expertise, including in particular our communications and marketing strategies, competition from former franchisees or the unauthorized sharing of such knowhow may undermine our competitive advantage that this know-how provides and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our franchisees may challenge the terms of our franchise agreements._ There can be no assurance that our franchisees will continue to accept the terms of our franchise agreements, in particular the levels of fees and commissions that we charge them in exchange for the services we provide as franchisor. For more information about our franchise agreements, see “Business—Our Business—Franchise model—Our franchise agreements”. In the main European countries where we operate networks of stores, our franchisees are represented by a national ----- franchisee commission (the Commission Nationale de Franchise or “CNF”) which we implemented to facilitate relationships between us and our franchisees. Members are elected by the franchisees in the jurisdiction covered by such CNF. For example, in France, the CNF is composed of 15 members for a term of three years. Moreover, our advertising plan which is prepared by management is presented to each CNF on an annual basis. Similarly, the level of communication fees to be paid by franchisees for the implementation of our advertising plan is submitted for CNF approval on an annual basis. The CNF is likely to have greater bargaining power than individual franchisees and may in the future successfully contest some of the terms of our franchise agreements and commercial arrangements with franchisees and in particular the level of communication fees. Moreover, although this has not occurred to date, our franchisees may initiate formal or informal collective actions against us. Any such action from franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are no material conflicts or proceedings between us and our franchisees. For more information about the CNF, see “Business—Our Business—Franchise model—Franchisee representation”. _Our franchisees are independent operators and we have limited influence over their operations._ Our revenue substantially depends upon our franchisees’ sales volumes. However, our franchisees are independent operators and we cannot control many factors that impact the performance of franchised stores. Although we are responsible for, among other things, implementing marketing and communications strategies and preparing merchandizing and store layout and decoration concepts, franchisees may set their own business targets and devise their own means to achieve them. We are not in a position to impose budgetary constraints on our franchisees that would otherwise help to ensure that their performance is maximized and maintain consistency across stores in our networks. For instance, our franchise agreements require franchisees to regularly update their store layout to reflect our latest store concept, but franchisees are responsible for financing the refurbishment and may delay the process, which may harm our brand image and undermine our reputation and negatively impact our commercial practices across our network. In addition, our strategy in recent years has been to implement common tools for use by all franchisees in order to improve and harmonize commercial practices across our networks and enhance their relationships with customers. For more information, see “Business—Our Business—Franchise model”. Franchisees may be reluctant to accept any such initiatives. In addition, we have been and may from time to time be subject to allegations that we failed to adequately monitor our franchisees, particularly in the context of allegations that such franchisees have committed health insurance fraud. Customers show low sensitivity to price when they expect insurance providers to fully or even partially reimburse optical product and hearing aid costs. As a result, some of our franchisees may be tempted to artificially inflate the price of optical products and hearing aids sold to a customer, up to the reimbursement threshold set by the customer’s OCAM. Any such claims may undermine our reputation, result in the imposition of fines, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We also face the risk that franchisees may intentionally work against our interests. For example, franchisees may fail to pay fees when due or at all, may publicly object to certain fees or may decide to share our confidential information or know-how with persons outside the Group, including the press. Additionally, a disgruntled franchisee may decide to share his or her complaints with other franchisees in an attempt to incite collective action against us. While such behavior might violate the terms of the given franchise agreement, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our franchisees may challenge us on our ability to support the growth of their business._ Our role as described in the franchise law (Loi Doubin) regulating franchise businesses in France is to provide franchisees with our expertise and know-how and to help them grow their own business. While our Group has provided such support from time to time and franchisees have grown as a result, we cannot guarantee that we will be in a position to provide such support in the future. However, ----- franchisees in certain of our geographical areas, where our business may not show a positive evolution in terms of network sales or expansion, could challenge our ability to bring the required support and may initiate formal or informal collective actions against us. Any such action from franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, there are no such material conflicts or proceedings between us and our franchisees. For more information, see “Business—Our Business— _Franchise model—Franchisee representation”. Our relationships with franchisees are subject to regulations applicable to franchise agreements, particularly in France._ We are subject to regulations governing the relationship between a franchisor and its franchisees in France and other countries where we carry out our activities. In particular, we are subject to regulations preventing undue interference of a franchisor in the franchisees’ business operations, as well as regulations requiring that we provide certain information to existing and potential franchisees. In France, pursuant to the Loi Doubin and the resulting provisions of the French Commercial Code, we are required to provide potential franchisees, or current franchisees contemplating the opening of a new store, with certain information, including concerning the Group, the network and the contract at least twenty days prior to entering into a franchise agreement. For more information about regulations applicable to franchise contracts, see “Regulation”. Any claim that we have violated regulations applicable to our relationships with franchisees, including claims that we failed to provide sufficient information or support to a franchisee or claims that we impeded the ability of a franchisee to conduct its business freely, may among other things result in the imposition of fines on us, harm our relationships with our franchisees, require us to compensate the affected franchisees or potentially trigger claims for contract annulment on the grounds of lack of consent, negatively impact the likelihood of potential franchisees joining our networks, and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Further, in France under French franchise law, franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who have freely entered into franchise contracts with a franchisor to trade under one of our banners and use our brand names and know-how in exchange for payment of certain fees and royalties. Although we are not responsible for the employees hired by our franchisees, any change in the relevant laws or re-characterization of the employment relationships between our franchisees and/or their employees by a court or tribunal could oblige us to either hire such employees directly or make arrangements causing us to incur liabilities related to contributions to certain social security programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Additionally, regulations pertaining to the relationships we have with our franchisees are likely to change. New regulations may be introduced in the future or be amended. In particular, rules that may require us to put in place a franchisee or employee representative body may be modified or replaced. For more information about the regulations governing franchise agreements, see “Regulation—France—Regulations governing franchise operations in France” and “Regulation— _Spain—Regulations governing franchise operations in Spain”. We rely on franchisee’s accurate reporting of their sales as a key performance indicator and the basis of calculation of fees owed by franchisees._ We rely on our franchisees to accurately report network sales in order to evaluate the performance of our networks and to calculate the fees we are entitled to collect under the terms of the franchise agreements. We use network sales to produce key performance indicators that are used for a variety of business planning and evaluation functions. Pursuant to our franchise agreements, franchisees are required to self-report certain performance indicators relating to their business, including sales levels, on a monthly basis. From time to time, franchisees may fail, intentionally or unintentionally, to accurately report their sales performance. Although franchisees are also required to provide us with a copy of their annual audited accounts, some franchisees may report sales levels that are lower than the actual sales levels. As a result, such franchisees may be charged lower royalties and communication fees than they would have been charged had they reported their actual sales levels. Following certain acquisitions, we may not be able to accurately monitor the sales of our new franchisees and correctly evaluate the relevant fees. The related reporting of these franchisees may be inaccurate and we may not be receiving accurate information at this stage. In addition, if a material number of franchisees do not correctly report ----- their sales, or if such reports are delayed, our network sales numbers will not be accurate, reducing the relevance of network sales as a key performance indicator to assist in strategic planning and our ability to analyze, plan and forecast our performance may be affected. We may also have to incur significant expense to obtain compliance with such reporting requirements. Any difficulties in monitoring and overseeing our franchisees’ operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.4,Risks related to our competitors,"_We operate in a highly competitive environment and we may not continue to compete effectively._ We operate in the competitive but fragmented optical and hearing aid retail markets. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, lower cost structures, larger purchasing economies of scale or better entrenched relationships with suppliers than us. Additionally, although the markets in which we operate remain fragmented, the optical retail industry in France and Europe has generally been dominated over the past decades by large retail optical chains operating in various countries in which our stores are located, such as Krys and Optic 2000 in France, or by the rise of other banners like Générale d’Optique or Optical Center. This pattern is also true for certain leading European optical retailers (such as GrandVision, Specsavers and Fielmann), who have also gained market share in recent years. In the hearing aid market in France, our main competitors, such as Audika, Amplifon and Audition Conseil, are already well-established operators. We also compete with several hearing aid suppliers which have become direct competitors by acquiring certain independent hearing aid retailers or chains that specialize in the distribution of hearing aids. This trend towards greater forward integration in the hearing aid market in certain countries may weaken our competitive position. In the optical retail market, independent retailers still represent a large proportion of the total number of stores in countries in which we operate. In France, independent retailers are sometimes able to adopt aggressive commercial strategies. In Spain, a pattern of independent retailers joining buying groups has emerged, with a focus on opening small stores requiring limited capital expenditure. Furthermore, independent retailers also control a large part of the French hearing aid products market. For more information about our competitive environment, see “Industry”. Independent retailers may continue, in response to the growing presence of large competitors in the market, to adopt more aggressive strategies to maintain their market share, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Our competitors may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. In addition, our competitors may further diversify their product offerings, enhance their presence in geographical markets in which we have a significant presence or be more effective and faster in capturing available market opportunities thereby undermining our competitive position and potentially weakening our market share. _We may be adversely impacted by the rise of vertical integration between our direct competitors and certain of our suppliers._ Our two markets, optical and hearing aids, have been marked in recent years by a growing vertical integration between suppliers and retailers. Consolidation trends in our optical and hearing aid products markets may result in the establishment of large purchasing or vertically-integrated groups combining supplier and retailer capacities, with greater leeway, leverage and resources than us may have an impact on our purchasing power and adversely impact the terms of our commercial agreements with our suppliers. Certain leading optical products manufacturers have gained significant market share over the past decade. For example, in October 2018 optical product manufacturer Luxottica completed its merger with lens manufacturer Essilor creating the integrated group EssilorLuxottica, which since then completed the takeover of GrandVision in 2021. Given the strong market share of GrandVision in Europe, at a comparable level with us in France, we, and the rest of our competitors, may face tougher competition in the future, due to GrandVision’s integration into the world leader EssilorLuxottica. To the ----- same extent, some of our main competitors in the hearing aid market, like Audika and Audition Santé, are held by Demant and Sonova which rank among the largest manufacturers in the hearing aid industry. These types of events could have a variety of negative effects on our competitive position and our financial results. _We face price and other forms of competition from new market entrants, which may adversely impact our competitive positions in our end-markets and our financial profile._ The markets in which we operate are competitive. We compete on the basis of our value proposition, including price, product quality, ability to meet customers’ specifications, range of products, retail footprint, online capabilities and customer service. In recent years, new competitors who target specific segments have entered the market, leading to increased market fragmentation. For example, brands like Jimmy Fairly, Le Petit Lunetier and Polette in the affordable luxury segment have entered the market. In addition, brands such as Lunettes Pour Tous, which offer products that are value conscious have also entered the market. These specialized entrants may erode the market share of established generalists like our brand, by offering tailored products or services that better meet the needs of niche customer groups. Additionally, their innovative approaches and agile business models may disrupt traditional market dynamics, forcing us to adapt quickly or risk losing relevance in the evolving marketplace. Any such developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. _We may be adversely impacted by new market entrants, including in the online space._ Certain optical products that we sell, such as ready-made reading glasses (“ready readers”), nonprescription sunglasses and contact lens care solutions are also sold through distribution channels other than optical retail stores. Those types of products may be distributed by pharmacists (primarily contact lens care solutions), fashion retailers, department stores or other points of sale, including websites. While we believe that the value-added services provided by opticians in our stores are not available to customers when buying through such alternative distribution channels, any increasing popularity of such distribution channels may adversely affect our business. The Loi Hamon, adopted in 2014, loosened restrictions on online sales of optical products prescribed by qualified opticians, and also facilitated online purchases of prescription optical products for customers, by requiring that ophthalmologists specify interpupillary distance on all prescriptions, i.e., the distance between the two pupils that customers are not able to measure on their own but would otherwise have to obtain from an optician. Since 2014, several online optical retailers have emerged in France, and many of the large retail optical chains, including us, have opened their own retail websites. In March 2014, we launched an ecommerce website providing an additional distribution channel for our optical products. Since then, our online business has expanded with the acquisition of pure players (Happyview and Malentille.com), which we have integrated into our wider online offer. Our e-commerce activity remains limited in terms of total network sales and corresponds in large proportion to contact lenses sales. During the initial COVID-19 confinement in the spring of 2020, our online sales increased and, as our online presence expands, we are increasingly better at tracking consumer habits and needs. We may, however, be at a time-to-market disadvantage in relation to our competitors, including pure players, who may have established online presences and developed experience in this distribution channel earlier than we have. If we are unable to keep up with our competitors or to further develop our online platform, it may translate into lost sales, particularly with respect to contact lenses, a segment which is forecast to grow at approximately 3% per annum until 2025 in France, according to a market study conducted by SWV in 2021, as customers are generally more inclined to purchase contact lenses than frames online. Finally, in a number of geographical markets in which we carry out our activities, including in France and Spain, our domestic markets, only opticians and audio prosthetists are allowed to sell corrective lenses and hearing aids, respectively, effectively creating a near monopoly for the sale of these products. As a result, retailers in these countries must employ opticians and audio prosthetists in order to offer these products to customers. ----- At present, there is a sufficient number of opticians in France, which has effectively weakened the impact of this monopoly, while the current shortage of audio prosthetists in France has strengthened the practical impact of the audio prosthetists’ monopoly. If opticians’ and audio prosthetists’ monopolies were challenged or weakened, the barriers to entering the market would be lower, and a larger number of new participants could enter the market and/or current market participants could reinforce their position in this market. For example, certain provisions of the Loi Hamon allow non-qualified opticians to manage optical retail stores as long as responsible personnel at the stores are qualified opticians. This provision is designed to increase competition within the industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In regards to hearing aids, there is a risk that the significant number of new players that have penetrated the market since the implementation of 100% Santé may become larger and more aggressive which, coupled with the recent slow-down of the market following the rapid market growth as a result of 100% Santé, may be materially adverse to our hearing aid business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.5,Risks related to technological changes,"_Technical, technological or medical advances may reduce the attractiveness of our products._ The optical and hearing aid products industries have experienced considerable technological changes in recent years, which has reduced and may continue to reduce or render obsolete the use of certain optical products and hearing aids sold by us. For example, laser eye surgery aims at permanently correcting certain vision deficiencies, specifically refractive ametropia (including myopia), by means of surgical intervention. Laser eye surgery has been performed for over thirty years, though the number of such surgical procedures in France remains stable and relatively low (estimated by SWV to be approximately 155,000 eye surgeries in 2020). Nevertheless, eye surgery may develop significantly in the future, either through innovations that improve the surgical methods employed (such as the femtolasik laser technique, which provides a superior quality of eye surgery, or the development of intracorneal surgery that aims to correct presbyopia) or by rendering those specialized surgical procedures more affordable, more accessible or less invasive. Certain specialized treatments such as orthokeratology (also known as corneal reshaping), involve the use of night-only contact lenses to correct myopia and presbyopia, which are dispensed by optometrists. Other potential new technologies, such as gene therapy and cell regeneration, may also succeed at permanently improving or correcting vision and/or hearing in the future. Similarly, if medical research were to lead to a cure for the various forms of hearing loss, such as by surgical techniques, the use of pharmaceuticals or breakthrough biotechnological innovations or therapies, our profitability could suffer through a reduction in the sales and revenue of the Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner. Other potential innovations, such as the development of self-fitting hearing aids or personal sound amplifiers, could result in a decreased use of our products. Moreover, we may be unable to replicate certain innovations developed and marketed by our competitors or we may experience delays before we are able to distribute innovative products, thereby decreasing the attractiveness of our offering. Any or all of the above factors may lead to a corresponding decline in network sales and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Hearing aid development cycles range from two to three years and we may not be able to develop or exploit new technologies in time to remain competitive._ Hearing aids have been the subject of technological advances, such as the switch from analogue hearing aids to digital hearing aids in the 1990s, that changed market patterns during this period and led to a global market realignment among customers and market players on the basis of this new structure. To remain competitive, we must be able to introduce new hearing aid models to our offer as quickly as possible. For example, hearing aid technology generally changes approximately every two to three years. In addition, the use of hearing aids entails a number of additional costs, for example the cost of adjusting a hearing aid to the wearer and the many appointments required before purchasing a hearing aid. The purchase process is long and uncertain and some consumers may not complete the process. Our inability to meet customer demands for new technologies, or the inability to offer ----- technologies that perform at the same level as those of our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We face operational and other risks in relation to e-commerce and online sales._ Although the portion of revenue that we derive from online sales is currently limited, e-commerce is expected to be an increasingly important part of our strategy in the years to come. Our e-commerce operations are subject to numerous risks, including: - reliance on third parties for certain ordering and customer fulfillment software and payment services; - vulnerability to phishing, hacking and system breaches, which could expose us to regulatory action or consumer complaints that could damage our reputation and our business, as well as more general risks associated with cybersecurity, some of which may be magnified by work from home and through other remote working arrangements; - the risk that our websites may become unstable or unavailable due to failures or necessary upgrades of our computer systems or related IT support systems, or disruption of Internet service; - difficulty integrating our e-commerce platform with our store networks; - violations of national, EU or international laws, including those relating to online privacy; - liability for online credit card fraud and problems adequately securing our payment systems, even if we use the 3D-Secure Protocol designed to ensure enhanced security and strong identification for our customers when they use their debit or credit cards for online purchases; - the incurrence of additional costs due to the necessity of investing in search engine optimization, the maintenance of our online brand presence and online connectivity that is commensurate with our brand positioning and optimization of the interface, allowing customers to easily locate, access and use our websites; and - the risk that pure players will manage to successfully develop brick-and-mortar operations in certain locations, such as pharmacies. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our failure to respond appropriately to risks relating to e-commerce and online sales and uncertainties could reduce our revenue from e-commerce, as well as damage our reputation and brand image._ Furthermore, we may not be able to continue growing and developing our e-commerce platform as planned, due to technical difficulties in adapting our business model to this distribution channel or other factors. The development of online sales is an ongoing, complex undertaking and there is no guarantee that any resources we apply to this effort will result in increased revenue or operating performance. In addition to the competitive pressures discussed in “—Risks related to our competitors”, the development of our online channel also faces specific competitive pressures. Consumers connect to our websites using a variety of devices (such as computers, tablets and smart phones) and operating systems (such as Windows, iOS and Android) which requires us to constantly strive to optimize our websites for such devices and systems. In addition, our e-commerce platform may also, to a certain extent, compete with our stores and cannibalize our in-store sales. The online channel presents a unique opportunity to directly engage with consumers from their homes but also poses organizational and technical challenges. A failure to successfully respond to the growing trend of e-commerce or, conversely, a failure to implement our plan to develop our online channel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.6,"Risks related to our brand, reputation and employees","_Our success is dependent upon the skills and continued service of our existing senior management team and of technically skilled employees._ The execution of our strategy and our continued success depend in part on the skills, continued efforts and motivation of our senior management team and other key personnel, as well as on their relationships with, and their understanding of the requirements of, our franchisees and suppliers. In addition, our growth strategy and forecasts depend on senior management’s deep knowledge of our business operations. If one or more members of the existing senior management is unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to find management personnel with the same experience and industry knowledge to replace or recruit such individuals. The departure of any member of our senior management team could impact us more seriously than the loss of other personnel. Furthermore, if any member of the senior management team or other key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, following the expiry or breach of the relevant non-compete clause, we may lose customers, know-how and other key personnel. The resignation or unexpected departure of one or more members of senior management or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We also believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain qualified, skilled and experienced personnel who can contribute to maintaining and enhancing our reputation by providing services in accordance with our high standards. In France, our stores must employ opticians and audio prosthetists who satisfy the educational and training requirements that allow them to provide optical and hearing aid product services. It may be difficult for some of our stores to hire and retain the employees needed for their business. In addition to the current shortage of ophthalmologists and ENT doctors in our sector, which can affect the demand for our products, we may face difficulties in hiring and retaining opticians and audio prosthetists in a number of the geographic markets in which we operate, notably in France. An inability to attract and retain qualified employees in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our success is linked to our founder and to his family._ Mr. Alain Afflelou, our founder, has been associated with our image and brand for both optical products and hearing aids, particularly in France, from the inception of the brand. We believe that, under the aegis of Mr. Alain Afflelou, the Group has significantly changed the optical and hearing aid retail industry in France by making available to the general public reasonably priced optical products and hearing aids of superior quality. Mr. Alain Afflelou has historically played a key role in our marketing and communications strategies and has been frequently featured in marketing and advertising materials. As an optician by training, Mr. Alain Afflelou played an important role in enabling the brand to be perceived as offering optical products of the highest quality. We believe that the general public in France perceives a close connection between Mr. Alain Afflelou, his family, and the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner. Additionally, some of our franchisees, particularly in France, also continue to associate the brand with Mr. Alain Afflelou as well as, to a certain extent, his three sons who are also employed by us and have executive positions in the Group. Following Mr. Anthony Afflelou’s appointment as President in November 2022, the association of the brand with the Afflelou family has increased. In consideration of the key role Mr. Alain Afflelou and his sons play in the Group and the fact that he is a well-known public figure, if he or his sons were to leave the Group for any reason, or if his personal reputation or his family’s reputation were to be harmed, there could be a material adverse effect on our reputation, brand awareness, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our success depends substantially on our brand awareness, reputation and know-how._ Our reputation, brand awareness and know-how are essential in ensuring the continued success and performance of our business model. The reputation of our brands is based primarily on commercial offers and product innovation, as well as our ability to convey a strong image to the general public through effective marketing and communications strategies. If we were to decrease spending levels on marketing and communications, for example, due to an increase in advertising costs or other constraints ----- that would make it difficult to maintain current levels of media coverage, or due to the rejection by the CNF (the elected representatives of franchisees) of our proposed communication fees, we may be unable to maintain our brand awareness, boost in-store traffic or stimulate sales and our revenue could be negatively impacted. In addition, there can be no assurance that our advertising and communications campaigns will be successful, resonate with consumers or generate more traffic to our stores and websites. We also undertake direct communications and marketing activities, such as pointof-sale display materials, catalogues as well as email and mobile phone text messaging. We can provide no assurance that our communications, advertising and marketing activities will be successful in promoting and maintaining brand awareness. As discussed in “—Risks related to our franchise activities—Our franchisees are independent operators _and we have limited influence over their operations”, our reputation may also be harmed by franchisees_ that operate their stores in a manner which is not consistent with our professional standards or with regulatory requirements. While we may terminate commercial relationships with franchisees that do not comply with such standards or requirements, any delay in identifying and addressing an incident may harm our image and reputation. For instance, we have in the past detected evidence of health insurance fraud on the part of certain franchisees. Even if we are not ultimately liable for our franchisees’ behavior, any incident, claim or proceeding resulting from such behavior may harm our brand, undermine our reputation, give rise to negative publicity or hinder our ability to attract and retain franchisees. A deterioration in the quality of services offered by our franchisees, delays in the development and implementation of our marketing and communications strategies, a decline in the quality of optical products and hearing aids offered to customers by the stores within our networks, or faults or defects discovered in certain products marketed by us may result in negative publicity. The damage to our reputation may be exacerbated by any failure on our part to respond effectively to such an incident. Such events that harm our brand, reputation or image could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our success depends on our ability to protect our brands and other intellectual property rights._ We believe that ALAIN AFFLELOU, Afflelou-Paris, Alain Afflelou Acousticien and Malentille.com and other intellectual property rights that cover the products and services we offer, including trademarks and domain names, are key assets that are fundamental to our success and position. We are therefore dependent on our ability to protect and promote our brands and other intellectual property rights, especially as we open stores in emerging markets (for more information about our intellectual property rights and how we protect these rights, see “Business— Research and development, patents and _licenses”). We cannot guarantee that our products and services do not infringe upon third-party_ intellectual property rights or that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged by third parties, including competitors. We may for instance be subject to intellectual property rights claims with respect to products that resemble some of our competitors’ designs and models. If a court were to determine that one or more of our products infringes upon intellectual property rights held by others, we could be required to stop using such intellectual property or pay damages or royalties to holders of such intellectual property rights. We also cannot guarantee that third parties will not infringe upon our intellectual property rights, for instance by using our brands or copying our products. In addition, we may be unable to adequately register and protect our intellectual property rights as we enter new markets, a risk that is particularly acute in emerging markets. Should our intellectual property rights be challenged or infringed upon, or should we infringe upon intellectual property rights of others, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _The demand for optical products and hearing aids may be adversely affected by the shortage of salespeople in our network and higher personnel costs._ The markets of our main geographical areas have in recent years demonstrated decreasing unemployment rates, coupled with the prioritization of growing concerns around quality-of-life requirements for employees, such as remote working requirements. As a result, retail markets in general, including our own market, are facing increasing difficulty finding qualified salespeople in our network who are committed to the traditional requirements of retail positions, further exacerbated by ----- the increasing difficulty to hire qualified professionals, such as opticians and audio prosthetists, that are required in our sector. We believe that such difficulties may have a material adverse effect on our business, by slowing down and limiting our expansion and impacting our and our franchisees’ profitability as a result of higher personnel costs associated with maintaining the adequate level of qualified staff in our network.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.7,Risks related to our general operations,"_We may be unable to successfully manage and develop our existing banner, brand and store network._ We currently plan to further develop ALAIN AFFLELOU, including the optical products and hearing devices segments. We may not succeed in strategically expanding through the opening of new directly-owned or franchised stores. We may be unable to identify attractive new sites for stores, based on demographics, proximity to locations of our existing stores, availability of suitable retail space or local economic conditions. A large proportion of the stores in our historic networks are located in city centers, with fewer locations in shopping malls and suburban retail zones that are currently popular retail destinations. Although we may want to open locations in shopping malls or semi-urban retail parks, it may be difficult for us, as a franchisor whose development is dependent on our franchisee network, to respond quickly to changing shopping trends compared to networks that primarily have directlyowned stores, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. We may also face difficulties in finding new or existing franchisees to open or operate stores in specific geographic areas. As some of our franchisees retire, we may face difficulties in finding, and transitioning stores to, new franchisees. In France, we made the decision during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 to discontinue our Optical Discount banner, following our intention to focus our development exclusively on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand. This decision was made due to the performance of the discount banner in recent years, which fell below our expectations, partly due to the implementation of the 100% Santé regulation which made it difficult for a discount banner like Optical Discount to differentiate itself in the market. If the management and development of our network were to slow down, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance that macroeconomic conditions will not impair our or our franchisees’ ability to obtain financing sources in the future, including, but not limited to, our or our current or prospective franchisees’ ability to incur additional indebtedness to expand or open new stores or refurbish existing stores. If we are unable to offer products, prices or commercial offers that are more attractive than those of our competitors, we may lose market share or experience a decline in sales. We may experience difficulties entering and expanding in emerging markets and our Alain Afflelou Acousticien banner may fail to offer competitive pricing in line with other hearing aid product retailers or to offer prices that are in line with our overall presentation of being “price-focused”, due to the high cost of hearing aid products compared to optical products. Our failure to address these challenges may lead to general price decreases, reduced network sales growth, reduced franchisor gross profit and a decline in our market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may be unable to successfully manage our digital transformation._ Over the last few years we have undergone a digital transformation of our brand, which included the development and maintenance of a large and efficient customer database enabling stronger interaction with our customers through digital tools, such as text and e-mails, a broader suite of digital tools that leverage social networks in our communication, the use of high-tech devices, such as digital interactive screens or tablets in our stores. In addition, we have grown, and continue to plan to grow our online sales through our Alain Afflelou website and Malentille.com. This digital transformation represents a significant part of our past and planned capital expenditure and requires a strong reinforcement of our teams in this activity. We may from time to time select suppliers or hire personnel who are unable to conduct our plans, and thus delay our ongoing digital transformation. While digital and high-tech solutions do not currently account for a significant portion of our activity, we believe these developments ----- will play a greater role in the future, so that our retail network could be adversely affected in the future if we fail to successfully implement this digital transformation. In addition, as we become more reliant on these digital tools that we have invested in, and will continue to invest in, we are exposed to greater risks. For example, our current and future digital tools may involve the collection, storage, usage or disclosure of confidential and sensitive data, including protected health information, and other types of personal data or personally identifiable information. Security incidents or breaches of this infrastructure, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, and employee or contractor error and negligence or malfeasance, could create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure or modifications of confidential information, causing health information to be accessed, acquired or altered without authorization or to become publicly available. See also “—Our sales operations are also subject to _changing regulations and laws governing online, e-commerce and in-person transactions, including user privacy and e-privacy, data protection and electronic communications laws and regulations, including the GDPR”. We are exposed to counterparty risks in relation to our customers, suppliers and health insurance companies._ We are and may become further exposed to risks of non-payment or late payment from customers, suppliers or OCAMs. In certain cases, when customers purchase optical products or hearing aids from a store, their OCAM may pay the optician or audio prosthetist directly. As a consequence, we may be exposed to a late payment risk from OCAMs for receivables in respect of a large number of sales, both indirectly through our franchisees and directly through our directly-owned stores. In addition, when payments are made directly to the optician or audio prosthetist directly, system disruptions or complete shutdowns of their systems may cause delays in receiving customer payments. For example, in February 2024, a platform managing the reimbursement of approximately 20.0 million policy holders suffered a cyber attack and as a result were required to shut down their platform for several days to avoid loss of any customer data. The situation was resolved within two weeks, with a marginal impact. We also sometimes act as a qualified credit intermediary in certain of our markets (Belgium and France), extending credit to end-customers for their purchases, which requires us to follow certain regulations and comply with informational requirements. Additionally, we offer end-customers insurance for some of our products via third-party insurer, which may expose us to counterparty risks from both insurers as well as our end customers. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We are exposed to counterparty risks in relation to our franchisees._ Our central listing and payment units aggregate our own invoices for services and products we sell to our franchisees, together with any franchisees’ purchase orders either within our central purchasing structures, or directly from listed suppliers, and we make the related payments to suppliers prior to collecting the contributions from franchisees. Although we have implemented monitoring of our franchisees’ financial performance and position, we are still exposed to risks on accounts receivable in respect of payments owed by our franchisees. Any loss or expense incurred due to defaults by our franchisees could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore we provide guarantees to certain suppliers in relation to payments from franchisees, for which we charge a del credere commission to suppliers benefiting from such a guarantee. We are subject to default from franchisees on such payments, which are processed through our systems. We also provide guarantees from time to time to financial institutions extending credit facilities to our franchisees. For further information on these guarantees, see “Business—Description _of our business—Services that we provide as franchisor— Procurement, purchasing and logistics solutions” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—Guarantee facilities”. All of the preceding factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of_ operations, financial condition and prospects. ----- _The operation of our directly-owned stores requires us to incur fixed costs and to undertake investment and operational risks associated with operating points of sale._ At July 31, 2023, we operated 83 directly-owned stores in France and 88 directly-owned stores in Spain, and six directly-owned stores in Other countries (in Portugal). Directly-owned stores tend to have a high level of fixed costs, including costs for personnel, leases, refurbishment and maintenance. We lease our directly-owned store premises from third parties. In addition, a number of our directly-owned stores are flagship stores, which tend to be located in first-tier locations, such as the Champs-Élysées and Forum des Halles of Paris. Due to the businesses in such areas that draw a large number of people, such locations tend to be more expensive to operate and to lease than ordinary retail locations, and are furthermore exposed to events such as terrorist attacks or social unrest. Were a significant terrorist attack or scenario involving social unrest to take place in such areas, this may diminish customer confidence in shopping in such areas and lead to decreased foot traffic in our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, the success of any store depends in a substantial part on its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to be attractive as consumer preferences and demographics change. In some cases, the renewal of leases for certain stores may be difficult to obtain and may require us to increase the amount spent on store leases or to find alternate locations for our directly-owned stores. If we are unable to renew, replace or obtain new leaseholds for our directlyowned stores (as applicable), our retail network strategy and expansion could be adversely affected. In order to optimize the management of our networks, occasionally we purchase and operate existing franchised stores on a temporary basis, for instance to secure our position at a promising site, to ensure that we do not lose a particularly attractive site in case of the retirement of a franchisee or transfer by a franchisee of its rights in a store or to turn around an underperforming store. In other cases, we seek to buttress our expansion in zones where we are not present, often to persuade new and existing franchisees of an area’s strong potential. Such stores can be operated for a time as directly-owned stores before transitioning to franchisee ownership. However, we are exposed to the risk that it may not be possible to transition such stores to franchisee ownership in a timely fashion or at all. In such cases, we may be required to continue operating the store as a directly-owned store for longer than we had initially planned or may have to close the store, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Operating retail stores exposes us to a number of other risks that are ancillary to such activity, including, but not limited to theft and misappropriation of inventory or funds and/or events that disrupt ordinary operation of directly-owned stores such as those caused by fire or flood. For more information about our directly-owned stores, see “Business—Distribution channels— Development and management of our store networks—Directly_owned stores”. The occurrence of any of these risks related to the operation of a significant number of directly-owned stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our marketing and communications strategy may prove ineffective._ Our network sales depend to some extent on the success of our communications strategy. We use various platforms and media, such as events, television spots, online advertising, magazines, visual merchandizing and social media, including Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok, to support the positioning of our brands and to engage with consumers. In some instances, we may use influencers to market our brand. As we are unable to fully control their efforts, we may be at risk if they engage in behavior or use their platforms in a manner that reflects poorly on our brand. It is not possible to prevent such behavior, and the precautions we take to prevent or detect this activity may not be effective. Moreover, the immediacy of social media precludes us from having real-time control over postings relating to our business via social media, whether matters of fact or opinion. Information distributed via social media could result in immediate unfavorable publicity we may not be able to reverse. This unfavorable publicity could result in damage to our reputation and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. ----- Maintaining consumer engagement and keeping abreast of fashion trends requires significant investment, including a dedicated team. Increases in competitors’ communications expenditures could force us to similarly increase our communications budget in the future and may materially impact our brand awareness and footfall to our and our franchisees’ stores, even if we match such competitors in terms of communications spending. However, there can be no assurance that an increase in communications spending will yield increases in brand awareness, footfall to our stores or traffic to our websites. For more information about our marketing and communications strategy, see “Business— _Products and commercial offers—Commercial offers and marketing strategy”. From time to time, we_ have engaged with celebrity endorsers to draw attention to our products, a practice which we may start again in the future. Our marketing campaigns featuring celebrities may not be well-received by customers if the reputation of one of these celebrities has been undermined. Additionally, we may not be successful in adapting to evolving communications tools. For example, if we fail to successfully engage consumers on various social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube and TikTok, or if any other element of our communications strategy fails, we could face a decrease in customer demand and a decline in sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may be unable to successfully introduce new product innovations and implement commercial offers._ Our historical success is attributable, in part, to the marketing of innovative optical products and hearing aids that are perceived as reliable alternatives to products otherwise available in the market. Our future success will depend on our continued ability to develop partnerships with optical and hearing aid products suppliers and enter into distribution and licensing agreements with such suppliers to introduce innovative products. In addition, we may not be able to continue devising and implementing unique commercial offers to market our products. If we are unable to continue to introduce innovative products and implement successful commercial offers, our future sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Acquisitions or investments may disrupt our ongoing business, distract management and employees, increase expenses and adversely affect our business. In addition, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisitions._ Historically, we have made acquisitions to fuel our growth strategy, penetrate new markets and drive our expansion into the discount activity and the online sales space and we may continue to make such acquisitions in the future. Acquisitions entail inherent risks, particularly when they involve contingent or other liabilities, including liabilities arising from events or conduct predating the acquisition, that were not known to us at the time of acquisition. We may also acquire a company that does not perform as well as we expected, which may not achieve profitability that is on par with the rest of our business or which may take significantly longer than planned to achieve the results we initially expected. For example, we acquired Optimil in July 2016. However we faced disappointing performance of the discount banner in Spain and encountered difficulties in implementing the various components of the franchisor’s offer in the Optimil store network. We therefore decided to sell the Optimil banner in the course of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 and completed the sale in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. As part of the integration of acquired companies into our networks, we may also incur significantly greater expenditures than we had anticipated at the time of the acquisition, which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and synergies across our networks. Acquisitions may also have unanticipated tax and accounting ramifications or tax disputes. For example, in December 2017, the French tax authorities notified the Group of a tax reassessment amounting to €1.5 million (including penalties and late payment interest) following an audit relating to VAT deducted by Optical Finance (the franchisor operating the Optical Discount banner), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the period from January 2014 to November 2016. It being noted, however, that the impacts of this tax reassessment have been fully recorded from an accounting standpoint and that no further unfavorable cash impact should be expected as the total amount of €1.5 million referred to above has been fully paid to the French tax authorities. For more details, see “Risks related to legal and regulatory matters— ----- _Risks related to disputes—We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings”. Further,_ managers of the acquired companies may depart, which could delay our integration efforts or the execution of such companies’ commercial strategies. Some of the risks associated with acquisitions relate to differences between the acquired business and our legacy business. For example, following the acquisition of franchisor banners, we often become party to legacy franchise agreements that differ from our standard forms, both in terms of franchisee obligations and levels of remuneration. Likewise, the periodic reports delivered by franchisees that we acquire may not be as in-depth as those provided by ALAIN AFFLELOU franchisees who are accustomed to providing monthly reports. In addition, the franchisees that we have integrated or that we may integrate in the future, may operate different sales systems or source their products in different ways than those used by us, which could reduce operational synergies until such time as such legacy franchise agreements can be renegotiated. Additionally, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, consummate acquisitions on acceptable terms, successfully integrate any acquired business into our networks, or retain an acquired company’s significant customer relationships, goodwill and key personnel or otherwise realize the intended benefits of an acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _The occurrence of catastrophic events, such as natural disasters, pandemics or terrorist attacks, and political instability could adversely affect our business._ The occurrence of catastrophic events and political instability could adversely affect our network sales. Our supply and logistics chain is global, spanning several countries for the sourcing and distribution of our products. Catastrophic events such as natural disasters, floods, fires, earthquakes, environmental incidents, severe weather, pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks and armed conflicts like the current war in Ukraine or the current conflict in the Middle East, in the countries in which we operate or from which we source our products, could have a negative effect on consumer spending in the countries where we operate or directly or indirectly disrupt our supply and logistics chain. Although we have no activity in Russia or Ukraine (direct or indirect through, for example, sourcing of our products), the current war between Ukraine and Russia may have a negative impact on consumer spending in European countries, including the countries in which we operate, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, recent events in the Middle East and the regional instability resulting from these events may disrupt global supply chains, increase energy prices and escalate security concerns, potentially causing market volatility. Significant fluctuations in the price of commodities could make it difficult for us to offset costs through price increases for our customers, which could reduce our gross profit margins and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For more information, see “—We are exposed to political, economic and other business risks in our _sourcing markets”. More precisely, events such as a terrorist attacks, political demonstrations or_ pandemics that either reduce footfall to our and our franchisees’ stores or impair our ability to receive products from our suppliers, could substantially affect our business. These risks would be exacerbated if they were to occur during peak shopping periods, such as the holiday shopping period. We cannot predict the extent to which such events may affect our business, directly or indirectly, in the future. We also cannot assure investors that we will be able to obtain or choose to purchase any insurance coverage with respect to occurrences of terrorist acts and any losses that could result from these acts. A significant disruption at our or our franchisees’ stores or an interruption in our supply and logistics chain due to such catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For more information, see “Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Recent regulatory changes and development”. The future expansion of our retail operations into new markets presents a number of risks._ Our management periodically evaluates expansion opportunities into new markets where we currently do not operate against a number of commercial and financial criteria. Expansion into new markets and development within our existing markets may take the form of organic growth, acquisitions of existing networks or joint ventures or other partnerships, including by way of directly-owned stores or new banners. Expansion into new markets is likely to carry greater risks than we face in our existing domestic ----- markets and such risks may be inherently higher if the expansion into new markets is made through acquisitions. New markets may have different competitive and market conditions, regulatory frameworks, customer preferences and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. We may face political instability in new markets that we enter. For example, political troubles in Hong Kong significantly affected our franchisee locally, leading to the closure of our franchised store in Hong Kong in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Furthermore, such events may lead us to put our growth strategy on hold either in full or in part. As a result, we may not be able to implement our growth plan in the short-, mid- or long-term, depending on the nature of such events and related government responses. We may also face higher costs of entry, reduced brand recognition, logistical difficulties and minimal operating experience in such markets. Our product offering may not be successful in new markets and our costs may increase due to cost overruns, unexpected delays or other unforeseen factors. Improving brand recognition may be difficult in new markets where competitors are already deeply entrenched, which may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as merchandising, marketing, directly-owned store operations, website expansion and enhancement, community relations, store aesthetics and graphics and employee training, which could adversely affect our cash flow and which may ultimately not be successful. Any of these challenges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. _Certain of our franchisees operate in emerging markets, and we are indirectly exposed to risks inherent in transacting in such jurisdictions._ We believe that emerging markets present unique opportunities to position the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand as a premium banner by building on our French heritage and distinctive own-branded products. However, our product offering may not be well-received by local customers and, although expansion through franchisees generally implies low capital requirements, we can provide no assurance that the benefits of this strategy will outweigh the costs that we incur to form franchise relationships and build our brand name in new markets. In addition, emerging market jurisdictions where we have expanded may have less-protective legal frameworks for our trademarks. As our brand becomes more recognizable, the risk of counterfeiting similarly increases, which could affect our brand integrity and our wholesale revenue. Moreover, although our international franchise agreements require that the relevant franchisee make payments in euros, royalties are set as a percentage of network sales, and therefore we are indirectly exposed to the foreign exchange effect of such franchisee converting a portion of our network sales into euro. Furthermore, we may be less able to exercise supervision and provide franchisor services to franchisees located in emerging markets with differing regulatory systems, including with respect to customs and medical product purchases. As a result of the foregoing factors, our efforts in emerging markets may be operationally complex and could be more costly than anticipated which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may be required to remove or recall defective or unsafe products and may not have adequate remedies against our suppliers for defective merchandise, which could harm our business and damage our reputation and brand._ As the distributor of our products, we are liable for the safety of the products we sell, all of which are manufactured and/or supplied by third parties. Product quality or safety concerns may require us to remove certain products from our store networks and our websites. If the products that we purchase from suppliers are damaged or prove to be defective, unsafe or of low quality, we may seek recourse from our suppliers but we can offer no assurance that our suppliers will replace defective products in a timely manner, provide us with refunds or sufficient indemnifications or that such incidents will be covered by our product liability insurance. Any failure by our suppliers to adhere to product safety or manufacturing safety standards could result in serious product defects that may not be detected by our quality control procedures and which may in turn lead to product recalls. Although there have historically been no significant recalls with respect to our products, there can be no assurance that a product recall will not occur in the future. Our reputation and brand could be damaged by the marketing of defective products, especially in the event of serious defects, such as the sale of products incorporating harmful substances causing physical harm or injury or other health problems. Such serious defects could also lead to a significant decline in network sales. In addition, we may be exposed to compliance lapses by ----- our suppliers, which could lead to investigation by agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. Any such event, especially if it results in a prolonged impact on product quality, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may incur significant repair or replacement costs in respect of product guarantees._ The stores in our networks provide certain product guarantees to customers, both as a result of contractual and legal provisions and for marketing purposes, which permits customers to be reimbursed for products that do not perform as expected. Existing and future product guarantees place our directlyowned stores and our franchisees at the risk of incurring future repair and/or replacement costs. If the amounts or frequency of product guarantee claims were to increase significantly, such as due to a decrease in product quality, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We are exposed to liability and reputational harm from injury at our directly-owned stores as well as our franchisees’ stores._ Part of our strategy is to create retail spaces that encourage customers to spend time in the stores in our networks and get to know our products. We and our franchisees are therefore exposed to the risk of liability from lawsuits or reputational harm if customers are injured at a store in our networks, either through no fault on our part or that of our franchisees or due to unsafe conditions caused by, among other factors, crowded conditions or the failure to use adequate care in stocking the shelves or installing in-store displays. We may also fail to grant our employees and customers adequate protection from future pandemics or public health emergencies through protocols implemented at store-level, including limits on the number of people in a store at one time, strict protocol for handling and sanitizing merchandise, frequent sterilization of tools, increased attention to hygiene and encouraging use of appointments for store visits by customers. While such occurrences are rare, any liability, reputational damage or negative publicity resulting from such injuries, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance._ We carry insurance of various types, including general business liability insurance, franchisor civil liability insurance, fraud and cyber insurance, transport insurance and directors’ and officers’ civil liability insurance and insurance for our directly-owned stores. However, there is no assurance that the insurance we carry will adequately cover the Group. We seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance but not all risks are necessarily covered by insurance and we may experience major incidents of a nature that are not covered. Furthermore, the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages within a calendar year could have a material adverse effect on our insurance premiums. In addition, our insurance premiums may increase over time in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. We may not be able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost. All of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our business may be disrupted if our information systems fail or if our databases are destroyed or damaged._ We, our franchisees and our suppliers rely on several information technology tools, platforms, systems and databases across our and their operations, mainly to support and monitor our and their networks, establish reporting, invoicing, the management of central purchasing units and the central listing and payment unit and various other processes and transactions. For instance, we use common point-of ----- sale software to operate our directly-owned stores. This point-of-sale software is critical to the daily operation of our directly-owned stores and the number of point-of-sale terminals we have in operation at a given time is limited. If these point-of-sale terminals were to become inoperative for any reason, we would not be able to quickly replace them. Our ability to effectively manage our operations and coordinate our interactions with our customers, suppliers and franchisees depends on, among other things, the reliability of these systems’ tools. Our e-commerce operations rely heavily on such information systems and are exposed to certain additional risks related to the computer systems and related support systems pursuant to which our websites are operated, such as liability for online content and breach of data privacy. More generally, we are exposed to risks related to computer viruses and malware, cyberattacks, electronic break-ins and similar problems. For example, in July 2017, Optical Discount experienced a brief attack on its computer systems. Any failure by us or our third-party providers to update and secure their systems or products, any disruption of their operations, any failure of our information systems to operate effectively, or any breach in data security causing unintentional disclosure of customer or other confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _The public perception and reputation of our brand could be damaged if we, our franchisees or our suppliers, manufacturers or subcontractors fail to meet evolving ESG standards and expectations._ We take various steps that seek to ensure that our products comply with applicable ethical, social and environmental standards. However, there is a risk that our efforts will not be sufficient in detecting or avoiding non-compliance or that we may face allegations of wrongful conduct. From time to time, our franchisees, suppliers, manufacturers or subcontractors may not be in compliance with local labor law or other recognized ethical, social and environmental standards. In the event of such non-compliance or allegations of non-compliance with such applicable laws or standards, or if the public perceives that such an event is occurring, whether or not it is, our public perception and reputation and our product lines could suffer, possibly damaging customer relationships and demand and causing a decrease in revenue. We do not control our franchisees, suppliers, manufacturers or subcontractors on a day-to-day basis and they may fail to adapt to evolving ESG standards, demands or expectations. In particular, although we regularly engage with our franchisees, suppliers and manufacturers or subcontractors, these efforts may not be successful in preventing such concerns. In addition, changing a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor following discovery of a violation of legal requirements or other deficiencies could result in additional costs and supply shortages or disruptions. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, in light of the increasing importance of ESG and sustainability practices to our brand and business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.8,Specific risks related to our hearing aid business,"_The existence of adequate coverage and reimbursement is particularly important for sales of our hearing aids in France._ Prices of hearing aids are generally high. For example, in France, the average cost of hearing aids was €1,557 per ear (and can exceed €1,800 per ear) according to a survey conducted by Arcane in 2023. Thus, adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-parties such as the public health system and OCAMs, which reduces the out-of-pocket cost paid by the end customer, is important for obtaining product acceptance and widespread adoption in the marketplace. For example, average out-of-pocket expenses for a hearing aid device have reduced from €1,069 in 2016, to €742 in 2019 and €542 in 2023 as estimated by Arcane. While a significant portion of the cost of hearing aids is currently reimbursable in France through the public health system, OCAMs and the _100% Santé_ regime, any cost-cutting initiatives by public or private health insurance schemes in the countries in which we operate that reduce the level of reimbursement available to consumers could negatively affect demand for our hearing aids. We expect that government regulation and third-party coverage and reimbursement policies will continue to limit the amounts that governments and other third parties will pay for healthcare products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, ----- financial condition and prospects. For more information, see “—Risks related to the French healthcare _system—We are exposed to risks relating to the reimbursement framework in France”. Prices for_ hearing aids have historically been subject to price erosion. The price of hearing aids decreases once a product has been widely sold on the market for a few years. As a result, evolving technologies and rapid innovation in the hearing aid marketplace significant pressure on prices, especially on products equipped with an older technology. While we believe that volume growth in France should partially offset declines in prices in the future, any reversal in that trend could increase the extent to which pricing pressure impacts our revenue and the revenue of our franchisees and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business and industry,13.1.9,Risks related to the supply of products in our network,"_We and our franchisees rely significantly on certain suppliers and service providers._ The manufacturing of our own-brand and exclusively licensed products could be delayed or temporarily or permanently interrupted. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities or equipment and therefore depend entirely upon third parties for the manufacturing of such products. The majority of the products that we sell are supplied from third parties located in Asia. Certain Asian countries in which our suppliers are located, namely China and Thailand, have both been affected, and may be affected in the future, by political and economic disturbances, natural disasters and labor shortages, which could impair the ability of our suppliers to fulfill our orders and those of our franchisees. If we experience a surge in demand or the need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. There is also a risk that production by one or more manufacturers could be suspended or delayed, temporarily or permanently, due to economic or technical problems such as the insolvency of the manufacturer, the failure of the manufacturing facilities or disruption of the production process, all of which are beyond our control. We do not maintain warehousing facilities. We outsource all of our warehousing and delivery logistics to third parties and rely on third-party suppliers to supply us and our franchisees with products in a timely fashion in order to meet demand from both customers and franchisees. If these services are interrupted or delayed for any significant period of time or if any of these third-party providers fails to fulfill any of their responsibilities, our image and reputation may suffer. This could lead to the deterioration of our relationships with potential and existing franchisees and customers. All of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We rely significantly on an intermediary agent in China._ We source most of our proprietary frames and sunglasses that are sold under our ALAIN AFFLELOU brand, as well as frames and sunglasses that we sell under exclusive licenses through a Chinese intermediary agent, Okia. Okia sources its products from subcontractors and manufacturers with whom we have no contact. As is the case with many retailers sourcing products from manufacturers in China, our Group faced higher logistic and transportation costs linked to higher energy costs, as well as supply chain disorders following the spread of COVID-19 in certain regions. Although we did not face significant shortages or difficulty sourcing our products, we incurred additional costs in sourcing our products from Okia. Okia or its subcontractors could experience further financial and operational impediments, such as difficulties in their supply and logistics chain, including delivery delays and stock disruptions or social unrest that could interfere with access to products and are exposed to risks inherent to doing business in China. The reliance on Okia could also impair our ability to execute our business plan within the desired timeframe if Okia were to fail to meet our requirements. In addition, any problem pertaining to the quality of products sourced by Okia or linked to the manufacturing conditions of our products in China (notably relating to compliance with national, international and European regulations on working conditions) may trigger negative publicity, adversely affect our reputation and result in loss of market share, especially as some of our competitors use the fact that they manufacture their products in France as a sales argument. Furthermore, Okia may increase the fees it charges us for its services, including the logistics costs that are passed on to us, or may abruptly cease working with us, including due to factors beyond our or Okia’s control, such as political issues affecting business dealings with Chinese ----- manufacturers or operational issues linked to the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics. In the event that we are not able to continue to rely on Okia, we may experience difficulties and delays increasing volumes with our other existing suppliers or in finding a new agent that meets our standards and allows us to source products in a timely and efficient manner. Even if we do identify a new agent, we may experience increased costs or significant delays in souring as we transition to such new agent. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Given our long-standing relationship with Okia, our commercial agreements with Okia are not systematically documented and formalized. In the event of disagreements or litigation with Okia, the absence of legally binding documents may hinder our ability to enforce our rights under those agreements and may therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, particularly in light of Okia’s importance in our supply and logistics chain. All the preceding factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our business may be adversely affected by the loss of, or actions taken by, our suppliers and changes to our contractual agreements and license agreements._ Our suppliers currently provide us with various revenue streams such as listing and del credere commissions on franchisee purchases, as well as early payment allowances. Suppliers that are selected to manufacture products sold under one of our signature brands, or in the context of one of our commercial offers, are also invoiced licensing fees based on the purchases of such products by franchisees. In addition, we retain a share of the discounts and rebates negotiated with suppliers when reselling products to franchisees, mainly through the central purchasing unit. We may not be able to continue to retain or find new qualified suppliers who meet our standards and levels of demand and supply products in a timely and efficient manner. Our suppliers may challenge the fees or discounts that are applied to them, decide to withdraw some of the services they offer or alter the commercial terms, conditions, discounts and rebates we have negotiated with them. We may also be adversely affected if our suppliers consolidate, thereby increasing their bargaining power, or if competitors sign exclusive supply agreements with or take over our current or future suppliers, diverting their manufacturing capacity away from servicing our needs. In addition, certain of our suppliers enjoy commanding market positions and we may be unable to secure products of sufficient quality or quantity if any such supplier ceases trading, demands higher prices or more stringent payment terms, is unable to meet our requirements or reduces its business with us for any other reason. Even if we do identify new suppliers, we may experience increased costs, delays and product shortages as we transition our product requirements to alternative suppliers. Such new arrangements may not be on terms that are as favorable to us as our current arrangements. Finally, any new supplier with which we do business may be subject to similar or even greater quality- and quantity-related risks as our existing suppliers. Additionally, from time to time, we have exclusive licenses for certain brands, for which the Group has an exclusive license, pursuant to which we source and distribute frames that are marketed under those brands. We may also from time to time market exclusive collections from designer brands, which are branded frames specifically created by designers for exclusive distribution by our networks. For more information about our licensing agreements, see “Business—Research and development, patents and _licenses”. Changes to or termination of our exclusive licenses or if we encounter difficulties in obtaining_ new exclusive designer brand licenses, this may divert customers to competitors and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We are exposed to political, economic and other business risks in our sourcing markets._ Most of our products are manufactured in markets outside the European Union, principally in China, Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia. We face a variety of risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing products from these markets, including, among others, political and economic instability, diplomatic concerns with such countries (including in connection with human rights issues or violations), increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods, imposition of duties or other charges and restrictions on imports, currency and exchange rate risks, exchange controls, delays in shipping and increased costs of transportation, risks related to labor practices and disputes, non-compliance with product safety or manufacturing safety standards, environmental matters, natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes or other specific problems in ----- the countries in which our products are manufactured. For example, political troubles in Hong Kong significantly affected our franchisee locally, leading to the closure of our franchised store in Hong Kong in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2020. Any such risk which disrupts the production of our suppliers, increases costs and/or delivery times and could result in increased costs for us or impact our ability to adequately supply our points-of-sale. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may face shortages of our products and significant inflation on certain components of our products._ Since 2021, in spite of the rapid economic recovery following the lifting of certain COVID-19 related restrictions, and following the start of the war in Ukraine in 2022 and the conflict in the Middle East at the end of 2023, some sectors have been impacted by certain raw material shortages, which have had knock-on impacts on a number of areas, including in relation to shortages of products such as microchips, electronic appliances, wood, etc. Although our Group has not experienced significant shortages to date, we may face challenges in the future, particularly in acquiring certain products like hearing aid devices and components used in the manufacture of glasses and lenses. Additionally, since 2022, global inflation has risen to historic levels in our main geographical areas. Although the impact of inflation on our product prices has not been substantial to date, we may face significant price increases for products such as frames (particularly those reliant on oil as a raw material) and inflation on our operational expenses, including personnel costs. Any such event, especially if it results in a prolonged impact, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks related to legal and regulatory matters,13.2.1,Risks related to disputes,"_We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings._ In the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various claims, lawsuits, investigations, arbitration and administrative proceedings, such as, for instance, antitrust or tax proceedings, some of which may involve substantial claims for damages. We are subject to certain antitrust proceedings. For example, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur was involved in a proceeding initiated by the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) in relation to certain anticompetitive practices concerning the prices of certain frames. The proceedings were ongoing until July 2021, when, following decision number 21-D-20 dated July 22, 2021, relating to alleged collusion practices in the eyeglasses and sunglasses frames sector, the French Competition Authority concluded the investigation with no findings made against the AFFLELOU Group. See “Business—Legal And _arbitration proceedings—Proceeding concerning alleged antitrust practices as the result of a vertical agreement concerning the price of frames”._ From time to time, we are also subject to tax proceedings in France. For example: - in December 2017, the Group received a notice of a proposed reassessment from the French tax authorities following an audit relating to VAT deduction made by Optical Finance (the franchisor operating the Optical Discount banner), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2016. The French tax authorities concluded that Optical Finance participated in a VAT tax evasion scheme during such period. The French tax authorities’ reassessment included adjustments amounting to €1.5 million (€1.0 million in tax reassessment, €0.5 million in penalties and in late payment interest). Following receipt of a letter from the French tax authorities confirming the reassessment of the full amount on August 16, 2018, the Group first provisionally decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal of the reassessment (€1.0 million ) and, subsequently, decided to pay all the penalties and late interest, thus meaning that the total reassessed amount of €1.5 million has been fully paid to date and that no unfavorable cash impact is thus expected in respect of this tax reassessment. We decided to challenge the ----- decision, and on March 5, 2019, the French tax authorities rejected our claim. Therefore, we decided to contest this decision before the French administrative tribunal of Paris and thus filed a claim on March 29, 2019, which was rejected by said court on April 6, 2022. The Group then decided to appeal this decision before the French administrative court of Appeal, which also rejected our request in a decision dated January 30, 2024. As we believe we still have arguments to put forward, the decision as to whether we should lodge an appeal with the French administrative supreme court is now being assessed. In this respect, it should also be noted that the Group exercised its call option pursuant to the vendor warranties issued by the vendor’s shareholders relating to its acquisition of Optical Finance (such vendor warranties being however capped at €1 million). - Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is regularly audited. For example: - it was subject to a tax audit for the period from August 1, 2009 to July 31, 2012. As a result of this audit, the French tax authorities issued a tax reassessment notice mainly reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain of its holdings in 2010, claiming that the sale price, as an arm’s length transaction, should have been higher. However, as we considered we had good arguments to contest the position of the French tax authorities, we decided to challenge such position before the French administrative tribunal of Montreuil, which nevertheless rejected our claim in a judgment dated November 23, 2023. We then decided to lodge an appeal against this decision with the Paris administrative court of Appeal on February 5, 2024. It should be noted that the amount of the potential adjustment that would result from this tax assessment has already been recorded in the Group’s latest financial statements as at April 30, 2024 for €21.1 million on our corporate income tax base, leading to a decrease of our carry-forward tax losses for a same amount. - Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is once again currently undergoing a tax audit, now covering the period from August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022, the final global outcome of which is still uncertain, although it can already be noted at this stage that: - the French tax authorities have challenged the eligibility of our research and development activities and expenditures for the research tax credit (crédit d’impôt recherche or “CIR”) and, on December 20, 2023, proposed a corporate income tax adjustment for an amount of €529,488 relating to our CIR for the period covering August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020 at this stage. As we consider that we have strong arguments to sustain our eligibility for the CIR, we are currently contesting the position of the French tax authorities. It should also be noted that we have recorded, in the Group’s latest financial statements as at April 30, 2024, a provision for an amount of €2,489,564. Nevertheless, should the French tax authorities confirm their reassessment and extend it (as the case may be) to the other fiscal years subject to audit, and should they be successful in their tax proceeding, we may be liable for additional corporate income tax (and any penalties and interest related thereto), which could have a total impact on our results of operations and cash flows of €1,916,805; and - the French tax authorities are also investigating the resources made available to (i) the Luxembourg company, Alain Afflelou International SA and (ii) AA Brands, the Swiss permanent establishment of the latter, respectively, to carry out their respective franchising and distribution activities, and their transfer pricing policies. At this stage, it is not possible to determine the possible outcome of such investigations and to assess any claims for payment of additional corporate income tax (together with any penalties and interest related thereto). Additionally, from time to time we are subject to litigation from current and former employees and franchisees, and have in the past been required to pay damages in suits for wrongful termination of franchisee agreements, for example. Adverse judgments or determinations in one or more of these proceedings may require us to change the way we do business or use substantial resources in adhering ----- to settlements or pay damages, fines or other penalties. The costs related to such proceedings may be significant and even if there is a positive outcome, we may still have to bear part or all of our advisory and other costs to the extent they are not reimbursable by other litigants, insurance or otherwise. In addition, provisions we make when threatened with actual or potential litigation may prove insufficient. For further information, see “Business—Legal and arbitration proceedings”. These proceedings, inquiries or disputes could undermine our brand and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks related to laws and regulations,13.3.1,,"_We operate in a highly regulated business environment and predicting legal and regulatory changes or developments is difficult._ Our ability to predict and adapt to changing legal and regulatory trends is important to our success. Any uncertainty as to regulatory trends or changes in policies in relation to our industry may delay or hinder our ability to achieve our strategic plans or increase the cost of implementing such plans. The sale of our products and the provision of our services are subject to a high level of regulation and oversight, including regulation applicable to the healthcare sector. The main regulatory requirements relevant to our business include the public health system and complementary health insurance reimbursement systems, recruitment and appointment of personnel, distribution channels and agreements, and limitations on advertising (for more information about regulations that apply to our business, see “Regulation”). We are also subject to commercial, antitrust, labor, tax, consumer and consumer finance regulations and other provisions. Regulatory requirements differ across the jurisdictions in which we operate and are subject to change. New regulations may be introduced in the future, and existing regulations and regulatory bodies may be amended, significantly expanded or replaced. We may be required to adapt our operations in order to comply with such changes. We may not be able to predict the content of new legislation and regulations and their effects on our business and we may not be able to adapt to regulations sufficiently quickly, or at a reasonable cost. Our operations may be adversely affected by regulatory developments and the cost of compliance with new regulations may be material. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, a number of public statements made by the current French administration may result in the eventual adoption of new regulations that could be implemented to the detriment of our business, particularly in regards to thirdparty payment systems and potential limits on out-of-pocket expenses paid for optical products and hearing aids. See also “—Risks related to the French healthcare system—We are exposed to risks _relating to the reimbursement framework in France”. We are exposed to the risk of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial action._ We and our franchisees may experience lengthy consultations with labor unions and works councils, strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions, as well as the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements or salary increases in the future, which could disrupt our operations or increase costs. In addition, strikes by employees of any of our key suppliers or services contractors could result in business interruptions. The occurrence of any of the above risks could disrupt our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We may fail to obtain, renew or maintain, or may experience material delays in obtaining, requisite governmental or other relevant approvals, licenses, certificates or permits for the conduct of our business._ Our activities require various approvals, licenses and certificates to sell frames and lenses, contact lenses, prescription sunglasses and hearing aids. We may encounter significant obstacles or delays in obtaining or renewing, or be unable to obtain or renew, new or existing approvals, licenses and certificates required for the conduct of our business, in particular in markets in which we have only ----- recently established a presence, or that we will continue to satisfy the conditions under which such approvals, licenses and certificates are granted. Although we monitor the status of approvals, licenses and certificates in markets in which we carry out our activities and proactively file applications to retain or obtain such approvals, licenses and certificates, there may be delays on the part of the regulatory, administrative or other relevant bodies in reviewing our applications and granting such approvals, licenses and certificates. In certain countries, the procedures for acquiring or renewing approvals, licenses and certificates may become more complicated and/or costly. If we fail to obtain, renew or maintain the necessary approvals, licenses and certificates required for the conduct of our business, we may lose customers or be required to incur substantial costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our relationships with our customers and suppliers are subject to stringent regulations._ The relationships between stores in our networks and customers are governed by consumer protection laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. Such regulations are designed to ensure the protection of customers, and generally include requirements that market players act fairly and provide customers with complete information to enable them to make free and informed purchasing decisions. In addition, our relationships with our suppliers are subject to specific regulations governing, for instance, disclosure requirements, fair dealing, ordering, delivery, pricing, invoicing, payment and intellectual property. Failure on our part or on the part of our franchisees to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing our and our franchisees’ relationships with customers and suppliers may result in investigations, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and administrative or legal proceedings. In addition, a failure to comply with regulations governing our relationships with our suppliers may entitle the relevant supplier to terminate our business dealings with us. Any of these developments may undermine our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We are subject to stringent security and data privacy laws and may be exposed to confidentiality and security breaches._ We and our franchisees are subject to complex and evolving European, French, Spanish and other laws and regulations regarding the collection, retention, sharing and protection of data obtained from and concerning end customers, as well as their employees and, for us, the franchisees themselves. In France, the Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés is the competent data protection authority. Since entry into force of the GDPR, we have not had to make any filings with or request authorizations from such authority (except in respect of certain very limited exceptions). The GDPR requires that companies that handle personal data adhere to the GDPR’s principles relating to processing of personal data and comply with certain recordkeeping and processing requirements and be able to demonstrate compliance with the aforementioned requirements to data protection authorities upon request. In addition to the GDPR, French data protection law no. 78-17 dated 6 January 1978, as modified, applies in France. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and any new requirements may result in modifications of our business practices and increased cost of operations to meet such requirements. In addition, opticians and audio prosthetists in our networks receive and store confidential, personal and sensitive data, such as medical, social security and other health insurance information with respect to customers, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the use and disclosure of health and personal information. As such, we receive and store this data from our directly-owned and franchisee stores. The amount of such data has increased following the implementation of our CRM program. _Our failure to respond to rapidly changing rules and regulation on telemedicine, together with the growing concern of the actors affected by the rapid development of telemedicine could harm our reputation and image._ As an early adopter in providing teleophthalmology solutions to our customers, our Group is at the forefront of this innovative healthcare service. The teleophthalmology landscape is evolving at a rapid pace, presenting both opportunities and challenges. As new practices emerge, such as customers ----- getting prescriptions directly through tele-expertise (through the implementation of asynchronous telemedicine) there is a risk that our competitive edge could be compromised. Moreover, the rules governing teleophthalmology are evolving and therefore it is imperative to remain responsive to the regulatory landscape to uphold our reputation as a leader in teleophthalmology. While we have taken steps to do so, there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. Moreover, the increasing adoption of teleophthalmology by our franchisees opens the door to potential deviations from our established protocols. Although we have certain oversight measures in place, we cannot guarantee that our franchisees will comply with such protocols. Our organization, along with our franchisees, has invested heavily in teleophthalmology. Should this technology not become as integral to our sector as anticipated, or if we fail to capture a significant portion of its benefits, the financial impact could be substantial. Additionally, our commitment to ethical practices means we refrain from advertising these services, as it is prohibited under applicable health laws. If we fail to navigate the above-mentioned changes carefully and safeguard our investment in teleophthalmology solutions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Our sales operations are also subject to changing regulations and laws governing online, e-commerce and in-person transactions, including user privacy and e-privacy, data protection and electronic communications laws and regulations, including the GDPR._ In December 2015, the EU approved the GDPR with respect to data protection. The GDPR enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties (up to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the global turnover) for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR became directly applicable in all EU member states on May 25, 2018, and to all other European Economic Area states thereafter. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, on January 11, 2017, the EU Commission published a proposal for an e-privacy regulation, replacing the existing e-privacy directive that regulated privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Discussions for the adoption of the e-privacy regulations are ongoing, on the basis of the latest proposal agreed upon on February 10, 2021 by the Council of the European Union. Further, customers expect us and our franchisees to adequately protect their personal information. The GDPR imposes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, high standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, the provision of robust and detailed disclosures to individuals about how personal data is collected and processed (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form), an individual data rights regime (including access, erasure, objection, restriction, rectification and portability), maintaining a record of data processing, short timelines for data breach notifications to be given to data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches, and limitations on retention of information. The GDPR imposes increased requirements pertaining to health data and other special categories of personal data, and is a constantly evolving law that can be subject to varying interpretations. While we have taken steps to comply with the GDPR where applicable, including by reviewing our security procedures, engaging data protection personnel, and entering into data processing agreements with relevant contractors, our efforts to achieve and remain in compliance may not be fully successful. If we, our franchisees, opticians or audio prosthetists in our networks do not adequately safeguard confidential customer data or other protected health information, or if such information or data are wrongfully used by us or our franchisees, if such data is disclosed to an unauthorized person or entity or if we or our franchisees fail to comply with privacy laws and regulations or data protection policies with respect to our customers, employees or franchisees, our reputation may suffer, and we may be subject to fines, penalties and legal proceedings (including criminal sanctions under the French Criminal Code) and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. To date, we are not aware of any material non-compliance in relation to our data retention activities. However, even though we have made make extensive efforts to comply with data protection laws and ----- requirements, we cannot ensure that we will not be subject to regulatory and/or private action nor that security breaches involving for instance customer transaction data will not occur. On October 24, 2023, the CNIL sent Alain Afflelou Franchiseur a letter informing it that it had carried out an online inspection dated October 18, 2023 in order to verify the compliance of personal data processing implemented by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur with the GDPR and the Loi Informatique et Libertés. The inspection concerned the website Afflelou.com and, more specifically the virtual fitting functionality and the functionality to simulate the look of particular eyewear, both provided by Fittingbox. Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is awaiting feedback from the CNIL on the additional information it provided on March 15, 2024 at the latter’s request. Any breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our websites and deter future purchases. _Changes in laws and regulations affecting the advertising methods we employ or the commercial offers we implement may adversely affect our ability to promote our brand and market our products._ We rely heavily on our communications, marketing and advertising strategies through the Internet and national media, including television, to promote our brand and commercial offers in our main markets. Changes in regulations restricting television advertisement by healthcare professionals, including opticians, may substantially impact our ability to promote our brand, commercial offers and product offerings. Depending on the classification of the applicable product, legislation in France and Spain currently imposes limits on content and/or requires pre-publication review of the content by the competent authorities. Currently, only contact lenses and contact lens solutions are subject to such regulation. However, such regulations may change in the future. Moreover, changes in regulations affecting our commercial strategy may impair our ability to conduct certain of our commercial offers. For instance, the regulation of consumer credit may tighten, which may hinder the continued success of our NextYear commercial offer, which allows customers to purchase our products on credit and free of interest and other charges. Likewise, regulatory changes that limit customer out-of-pocket spending on certain optical products and hearing aids may reduce the attractiveness of certain of our commercial offers, such as NextYear, which we use to draw new and returning customers to our stores. For more information about our commercial offers, see “Business—Consumer financing solutions”. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Changes in customs regulations, including customs duties, may adversely affect our operations._ Our business relies on our effective supply strategy. Our main supplier, which supplies the majority of frames and sunglasses that we market under our own brands, is Okia (see “Business—Sourcing, _branding and manufacturing”). In addition, our suppliers of exclusive collections from designer brands,_ own-brand lenses and contact lenses and non-exclusive products manufacture or source products from countries which are not members of the European Union. Due to our significant import activities, we are subject to changes in customs regulations, and particularly customs duties. Our and our franchisees’ purchasing costs may be adversely affected if export and import regulations in the countries from which we or our suppliers source products, or import regulations in the European Union, become more stringent or costly. For instance, our and our franchisees’ purchasing costs may be affected by an increase in the amount of customs duties that we or our suppliers are required to pay. We may be unable to pass on any additional costs associated with more stringent customs regulations to franchisees and our franchisees may be unable to pass on such costs to end customers. As a result, any changes in customs regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _Changes in medical device regulations._ Our business operations could be significantly impacted by amendments to medical device regulations. Notably, the European Regulation on medical devices (EU Regulation 2017/745) came into effect on May 26, 2021, and is being implemented in stages, each with its own transition period. This regulation is designed to enhance the safety, quality, and performance of medical devices by introducing more stringent requirements for manufacturers prior to placing a device on the market. It also emphasizes the importance of transparency, mandating that comprehensive information about medical devices, ----- including reports on incidents and ongoing investigations, be readily accessible in Europe. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. For more information, see “Regulation— _Medical Device Regulation”._ The 2023 French social security legislation introduces several key measures pertaining to medical devices. Among these measures is the authority granted to the ministers overseeing the economy, health, and social security sectors to regulate the distribution margins for medical devices. This regulation will consider the changing costs, revenues, and business volumes of the entities involved. Additionally, the legislation empowers these ministers to cap the discounts medical device suppliers can offer to retailers at a maximum of 50.0% of the pre-tax sale price. These measures will come into force on December 31, 2025, at the latest. Our relationship with our suppliers may be affected by this regulation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations applicable in the countries in which we operate or intend to operate._ We must comply with certain anti-corruption laws, sanctions and other similar regulations. For example, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the French Criminal Code and law of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, fighting corruption and modernizing economic life (more widely known as the “Sapin II Law”) and other similar anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials and/or private counterparts for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business and require the implementation of an anti-bribery compliance program. Furthermore, as supplier and/or distributor of medical devices, we are subject to, along with our franchisees as healthcare professionals, the French anti-gifting law. This law (reinforced by a decree dated June 15, 2020) prohibits any supplier or distributor of medical devices from offering or promising advantages in cash or in kind, in any form whatsoever, in a direct or indirect manner, to healthcare professionals. We operate in certain parts of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but despite our compliance policies and training efforts, we cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our employees. Further, due to the global nature of our operations, we may use local agents or subcontractors to understand unfamiliar environments and differences in cultural, legal, financial and accounting complexities and obligations, or to carry out a portion of the activities called for by a particular contract. There is a risk that such agents or subcontractors may be involved in illegitimate activities in local markets that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately supervise them or maintain an adequate compliance program, we may be liable for their actions. Similarly, our franchisees and our suppliers may be involved in activities that our onboarding and diligence procedures may be unable to detect and that may put us at risk for non-compliance with anti-corruption and similar laws. Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our reputation and consequently negatively impact our business. On the other hand, any such violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair advantage when bidding for contracts. The consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Assets subject to testing include goodwill and intangible assets such as the value of our trademarks and customer lists. In addition, our management must test for impairment of goodwill at least once a year, whether or not there are any indicators of impairment. IFRS require us to recognize a non-cash charge in an amount equal to any impairment. As of July 31, 2023, intangible assets susceptible to impairment charges under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets represented 75.7% (post-IFRS 16) including rights of use of our total assets. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets may result in material reductions of our revenue and equity under IFRS. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects. _The Issuer is a holding company and will be dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the Notes._ The Issuer is a holding company that conducts no business operations of its own and has no significant assets other than the shares it holds in the Subsidiary Guarantors and its receivables under the Notes Proceeds Loans and any future intercompany loans. As a result, the Issuer is dependent upon the cash flow from its subsidiaries in the form of dividends, intercompany loans, or otherwise to make any payments due on the Notes. In addition, the Issuer’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to the Issuer under some circumstances. These circumstances could include, among others, restrictions under French or other applicable corporate law, and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities and other indebtedness, that may affect the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the Issuer. In addition, applicable tax laws may also subject such payments to taxation. We cannot assure you that the arrangements with our subsidiaries, the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries and our results of operations and cash flow generally will provide us with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments on the Notes. In the event that we do not receive distributions or other payments from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on the Notes, and we do not expect to have any other sources of funds that would allow us to make payments to holders of the Notes. _The interests of our shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of the Notes._ The Sponsor is the indirect majority shareholder of the Issuer. The interests of the Sponsor and/or any other principal shareholder in the future could conflict with each other and/or the interests of the holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our liabilities when due. Any principal shareholder could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, dividend distributions or other transactions that, in its judgment could enhance its investment, although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. In addition, our shareholders may also invest or acquire businesses that compete with us. Our shareholders have no contractual obligations to fund our business and may not have sufficient liquidity to fund our business if we require additional funding. Additionally, the Indenture will permit us to pay management fees, dividends or make other restricted payments under certain circumstances, and our main shareholders may have an interest in us doing so. In addition, for compliance with certain restrictive covenants under the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and other agreements governing our indebtedness, we will depend upon the cooperation of the Sponsor who has, in conjunction with the other shareholders of the Issuer, the power to control decisions with respect to the Group and influence compliance with such covenants. For example, our shareholders could vote to cause us or one of our ----- subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, to sell certain material assets or make dividends, in each case, so long as the covenants governing our indebtedness so permit. _The pro forma and non-IFRS financial measures included in this Offering Memorandum are presented for informational purposes only and may not be an indication of our financial condition or results of operations in the future._ This Offering Memorandum includes certain _pro forma and non-IFRS financial measures including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Pre-IFRS 16, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, free cash flow conversion. We have prepared Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA on the basis of certain estimates and assumptions to present an estimate of Adjusted EBITDA generated for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 adjusting for certain changes in perimeter and certain other store openings and closures as set out under “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data—Pro Forma Adjusted _EBITDA.” Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a projection, estimate or guarantee of performance_ regarding Adjusted EBITDA generation for the year ending July 31, 2024 or July 31, 2025 or any other future period which may be affected by definitive closures of stores, competitive dynamics and average prices. _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is subject to significant business, economic, financial and competitive risks and uncertainties that could have caused actual results to differ materially. _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the non-IFRS measures included in this Offering Memorandum and_ the underlying calculations have not been audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended April 30, 2024 would have been under certain circumstances and assumptions as described herein; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS, and you should not consider _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of the Group’s results of operations or liquidity.

Changes in tax laws or regulations or to their interpretations could adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments. In particular, European and French tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and are subject to varying interpretations. In this respect, the incorporation into French tax law of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (the “OECD”) principles related to base erosions and profit shifting (“BEPS”) included in the final reports released by the OECD as well as the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent BEPS (the “MLI”) signed in Paris on June 7, 2017 could increase the administrative efforts within the Group and impact existing structures. For all countries which ratify the MLI after France, the relevant dates of application should be calculated on an individual basis. The MLI notably introduces a “principal purpose test” (“PPT”) denying tax treaty ----- benefits to companies when obtaining such benefits was “one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in” these benefits, unless granting these benefits under the given circumstances would be “in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions” of the tax treaty. Whether a French entity relying on tax treaty benefits can be construed as being part of such type of arrangement will predominantly depend on source state views. Furthermore, the European Union continues to harmonize tax legislation of the Member States. In this respect, on July 12, 2016, the Council of the European Union adopted a directive laying down rules against tax avoidance practices that directly affect the functioning of the internal market (Council Directive 2016/1164) (the “ATAD”). The ATAD was later amended on May 29, 2017 by the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 (the “ATAD 2”), which, _inter alia, extends the scope of the ATAD to hybrid mismatches involving third countries and provides that its provisions apply (subject to certain exceptions) from January 1, 2020. Among the set of measures, the ATAD provides for a general interest limitation rule pursuant to which the tax deduction of net financial expenses is limited to 30% of the taxpayer’s tax-adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or to a maximum amount of €3 million, whichever is higher (subject to several exceptions) (Article 4 of the ATAD). Such rules apply from January 1, 2019 following their transposition into French tax law by Article 34 of the French Finance Law for 2019 (Law 2018-1317 of December 28, 2018) (the “French Finance",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,"Law for 2019”). The French Finance Law for 2020 (Law 2019-1479 of December 28, 2019) also",13.5.1,,"introduced under French tax law the provisions of the ATAD 2 and thus repealed the existing French anti-hybrid rules, as set forth in Article 212-I-b of the _French Code général des impôts_ (the “FTC”). _See “Risk Factors—Risks related to tax—French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness”._ Moreover, Article 108 of the French Finance Law for 2019 introduced under French tax law, the antiabuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions. Pursuant to this provision, the French tax authorities might ignore an arrangement or a series of arrangements which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The condition relating to the absence of genuineness of the arrangement or series of arrangements would be met if such arrangement or series of arrangements is not justified by valid economic or commercial reasons. The European Commission also published a corporate reform package proposal on October 25, 2016 including three new proposals aimed at (i) re-launching the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (“CCCTB”) which is a single set of rules to compute companies’ taxable profits in the EU, (ii) avoiding loopholes associated with profit-shifting for tax between EU countries and non-EU countries, and (iii) providing new dispute resolution rules to relieve problems with double taxation for businesses. On May 18, 2021 the European Commission communicated a new plan called Business in Europe: Framework for Income Taxation (“BEFIT”) which aims to replace the CCCTB in the European tax policy proposals. BEFIT is based mainly on the framework of the OECD’s international tax reform project, and would involve the consolidation of the profits of the EU members of a multinational group into a single tax base, which will then be allocated to Member States using a formula, to be taxed at national corporate income tax rates. The preparation for this new proposal will be carried out by the European Commission alongside the Member States and the European Parliament and will give rise to consultations with the business sector and civil society groups. The European Commission adopted the BEFIT directive proposal on September 12, 2023. The adoption of this proposal should technically require the European Parliament’s opinion before reaching the Council of the European Union (where unanimity needs to be obtained). It should be noted, in this respect, that European Union officials have recently confirmed that the legislative discussion was expected to start at the end of May 2024. On September 12, 2023, the European Commission also published a proposal for a Council Directive on transfer pricing (which is part of the BEFIT package) aiming at incorporating the arm’s-length ----- principle into European Union law, harmonizing the key transfer pricing rules, clarifying the role and status of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines and creating the ability to establish, within the European Union common binding rules on specific transfer pricing subjects. Should this Directive be adopted, Member States would have to apply these provisions as from January 1, 2026 for the transfer pricing proposal and July 1, 2028 for BEFIT. Alongside BEFIT, the European Commission also announced, among other things, that it would (i) introduce a legislative proposal setting out union rules to neutralize the misuse of shell entities for tax purposes (the “ATAD 3 Proposal”),(ii) adopt a recommendation on the domestic treatment of losses and (iii) make a legislative proposal creating a Debt Equity Bias Reduction Allowance (“DEBRA”). The European Parliament approved the ATAD 3 Proposal on January 17, 2023 (which was released by the European Commission on December 22, 2021). In order to be definitively adopted, the text will need to be approved by the Council of the European Union and subsequently implemented by Member States. Even if the European Council has initially targeted an application of this directive as from January 1, 2024, the exact timing for the vote and the directive’s implementation by Member States remains unclear at this stage. In addition, on October 8, 2021, members of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS (the Inclusive Framework) agreed to the Statement on the Two-Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalization of the Economy reflecting the agreement reached by 136 out of the 140 Inclusive Framework members. The Two-Pillar Solution is comprised of Pillar One and Pillar Two. - Pillar One aims at ensuring a distribution of profits and taxing rights among countries with respect to the largest multinational enterprises (“MNEs”) through the re-allocation of taxing rights over 25% of the residual profit of the largest and most profitable MNEs to the jurisdictions where the customers and users of those MNEs are located (“Pillar One”). - Pillar Two puts a floor on tax competition on corporate income tax through the introduction of a global minimum corporate tax at a rate of 15% that countries can use to protect their tax bases (the “GloBE rules”) (“Pillar Two”). On December 20, 2021, the OECD published the Pillar Two model rules (the “Model Rules”) for the domestic implementation of the 15% global minimum tax rate agreed upon in October 2021. The new Model Rules aim to assist countries to bring the GloBE rules into domestic legislation. They provide for a coordinated system of interlocking rules that (i) define the MNEs within the scope of the minimum tax; (ii) set out a mechanism for calculating an MNE’s effective tax rate on a jurisdictional basis, and for determining the amount of top-up tax payable under the rules; and (iii) determine the member of the MNE group which will be required to pay the top-up tax. On December 14, 2022, Directive 2022/2523 setting forth rules to ensure a global minimum level of taxation for multinational groups was adopted. The Directive aims at consistently implementing among all 27 Member States the Model Rules that include an Income Inclusion rule (“IIR”) and an Under Taxed Payment Rule (“UTPR”). However, it also extends its scope to large-scale purely domestic groups, in order to ensure compliance with the European Union fundamental freedoms. In addition, the Directive makes use of an option contemplated by the Inclusive Framework whereby an entity located in a Member State that is low-taxed (referred as constituent entity) applying the IIR is required to ensure effective taxation at the minimum agreed level not only for foreign subsidiaries but also for all constituent entities resident in that Member State. The Member States had to transpose the directive into their national laws by December 31, 2023 for the rules to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2023 (with the exception of the UTPR, which is to be applicable for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, 2024). The French Finance Law for 2024 (Law 2023-1322 of 29 December 2023) transposed the directive implementing Pillar Two into French domestic law, introducing a minimum tax of 15% on the profits of MNEs that operate in France and have a consolidated revenue of at least €750.0 million generated during at least two of the last four fiscal years. ----- On October 11, 2023, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework published the text of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Amount A of Pillar One (the “MLC”). Amount A of Pillar One co-ordinates a reallocation of taxing rights to market jurisdictions with respect to a share of the profits of the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises operating in their markets, regardless of their physical presence. It also ensures the repeal and prevents the proliferation of digital services taxes and relevant similar measures, secures mechanisms to avoid double taxation, and enhances stability and certainty in the international tax system. Furthermore, new rules on tax dispute resolution have applied since January 1, 2019, following the transposition of Council Directive 2017/1852 of October 10, 2017 into French tax law. These new regulations could impact our tax position in the future. On our part, we often rely on generally available interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are thus prepared in accordance with applicable tax legislation and prevailing case law. Certain tax positions we take are also based on industry practice, tax advice we have received in some cases from third parties (including legal counsel), and similarities to facts and circumstances described in case law. These positions may relate to tax compliance (especially in the current international tax context tending towards enhanced mandatory disclosure obligations), classification of income, treaty relief and withholding tax, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base. However, we cannot be certain that the relevant tax authorities will be in agreement with our interpretation of these laws. Being subject to tax audits on a regular basis, any challenges from relevant tax authorities with respect to our application and interpretation of tax rules may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, and such adjustments may not be favorable to us. If any such challenges are made and are not resolved in our favor, they could result in significant additional tax liabilities and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Prospective investors should also consult their own tax advisors on the impact of these OECD and/or European Union measures (certain of which having already been implemented in French law) prior to making an investment decision in respect of the Notes. _Our future results, French and foreign tax regulations and tax audits or disputes could limit our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards and, as a result, could have an impact on our financial condition._ At the Group level, we had tax loss carryforwards of €108.9 million as of July 31, 2023 (of which €102.7 million were generated by our French operations and €86.6 million were generated within the consolidated French tax group), these amounts to be reduced by a total of €21.1 million to take into account the above-mentioned tax reassessment covering the period from August 1, 2009 to July 3, 2012 at the level of Alain Afflelou Franchiseur – see “Risks related to legal and regulatory matters— _Risks related to disputes—We are subject to risks from legal and arbitration proceedings”. Deferred tax_ assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards at the Group level amounted to €23.2 million as of July 31, 2023, this amount also to be reduced by €5.5 million due to the above-mentioned tax reassessment at the level of Alain Afflelou Franchiseur. The ability to effectively use such carryforward tax losses depends on a variety of factors, including: (i) the ability to generate taxable income and the adequacy between such income and tax losses; (ii) the general limitation applicable to French carryforward tax losses, under which the percentage of carryforward tax losses that may be used to offset the portion of taxable income exceeding €1 million is limited to 50%, as well as certain specific restrictions relating to the use of certain categories of carryforward tax losses; (iii) limitations to the use of tax losses that may be imposed by foreign laws and regulations (e.g., in case of a change in control); (iv) the outcome of present and future tax audits and litigations; (v) potential changes in applicable laws and regulations; and (vi) in part, the outcome of the ongoing proceedings with the French tax authorities. See “Risks related to legal and regulatory matters—Risks related to disputes—We are subject to risks _from legal and arbitration proceedings”._ ----- _French tax legislation may restrict the deductibility, for French tax purposes, of all or a portion of the interest on our indebtedness incurred in France, thus reducing the cash flow available to service our indebtedness._ As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39-1-1° of the FTC, expenses incurred by a French company are deductible; provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management” according to which the expenses incurred by a French company, in connection with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest, are not tax deductible. Under Article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a borrower to a creditor that is a direct shareholder but not a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (currently 5.96% for companies closing their fiscal year between 31 May 2024 and 29 June 2024). By exception, Article 212, I (a) of the FTC provides that interest incurred on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible up to the rate referred to in Article 39.1.3° of the FTC or, if higher, up to the rate that the borrowing entity could have obtained from independent financial institutions in similar conditions. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are controlled by the same third-party enterprise under the conditions defined in (i) above. In both cases (i.e., non-deductibility under Articles 39-1-3° and 212 I-(a) of the FTC), non-deductible interest might be re-characterized as deemed dividends pursuant to Articles 109 _et seq. of the FTC, and may thus be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC, at the rate of (i) 25% (generally) for payments benefiting to legal persons, or (ii) 75% for payments made in noncooperative jurisdictions (Etat ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other than those only mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A (subject in each case to the more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). Moreover, under article 212 bis of the FTC, for financial years opened as from January 1, 2019, net financial expenses (“NFE”) are deductible up to the higher of €3 million per financial year and 30% of the borrower’s tax-adjusted EBITDA, corresponding to its taxable result before offset of tax losses and without taking into consideration tax, NFE and, to some extent, depreciation, amortization, provisions and capital gain/losses (subject to several exceptions) (the “30% Limitation”). Such limitation applies to both related-party and third-party financings regardless of the purpose of these financings, subject to certain limited exceptions. The NFE are defined as the excess, if any, of the financial expenses of the borrower over its financial income. Special rules also apply to the NFE related to members of French tax consolidated groups. If the borrower belongs to a consolidated group, and its ratio of equity to aggregated assets is equal to or higher than the corresponding ratio of the group, then 75% of any non-deducted NFE, under the above rule, becomes deductible (i.e., the “Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor”). French thin-capitalization rules apply in respect of loans granted by related parties. If the borrower has a ratio of affiliated debts to equity that exceeds 1.5:1.0, it is viewed as thinly capitalized, and the deduction of the NFE borne by such entity is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its tax-adjusted EBITDA and (ii) €3 million, multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average ----- amount of sums borrowed from or made available by non-related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC increased by 1.5 times the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of NFE is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 10% of its tax-adjusted EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of sums borrowed from or made available by related parties (directly or indirectly) within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC exceeding 1.5 times the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or on the closing date of the fiscal year) by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year. These specific limitations do not apply if the ratio of affiliated debts to equity of the borrower is lower or equal to the corresponding ratio of the consolidated group to which it belongs (i.e., the “Indebtedness Safe",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,Harbor”).,13.6.1,,"These thin-capitalization rules could apply at the level of the Issuer’s tax consolidated group (in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer (or any company belonging to the same French tax consolidated group) from any related party) (the “Thin Capitalized Perimeter”) and at the level of the Issuer’s French subsidiaries that do not belong to the same French tax consolidated group as the Issuer with respect to any amount of the proceeds of the Notes used by the Issuer to grant intragroup loans to such subsidiaries, as well as, more generally, in respect of any loans contracted by the Issuer’s French subsidiaries from any related party. The 30% Limitation is increased by 75% of the portion of the NFE that is non-deductible after application of the €3 million or 30% tax-adjusted EBITDA limitation in three circumstances: (i) autonomous companies (i.e., companies that are not members of a consolidated group, have no establishment outside France and no associated company (appreciated between entities holding a stake of at least 25%)); (ii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group that does not qualify as a Thin-Capitalized Perimeter and that benefits from the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor; and (iii) companies or tax consolidated groups belonging to a consolidated group which qualifies as a ThinCapitalized Perimeter but benefits from both the Indebtedness Safe Harbor and the Financial Autonomy Safe Harbor. The portion of the NFE that is non-deductible pursuant to the 30% Limitation, in respect of a given financial year, may be carried forward indefinitely and deducted from the subsequent financial years subject to the same limitations (in case of thinly capitalized entities, only one-third of the NFE exceeding the second deduction ceiling may be carried forward). Also if a portion of a deductibility capacity, in respect of a given financial year, is not fully used by the borrower (other than a thinly capitalized one), it may be carried forward to the next five financial years but only against financial expenses incurred in respect of those fiscal years. Pursuant to the Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques-Impôts BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-10-20, § 20, dated May 13, 2020 and BOI-IS-BASE-35-40-20, § 240, dated May 13, 2020, the portion of interest that is not deductible by virtue of (i) Article 212 bis, I of the FTC under the 30% Limitation and/or (ii) Article 212 _bis, VII of the FTC under the thin-capitalization rules is not to be recharacterized as a “deemed_ distribution” pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC and, therefore, is not subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC. In addition, ATAD 2 in relation to hybrid mismatches with third countries has been implemented and is applicable from January 1, 2020, except for certain of its provisions that are applicable since January 1, 2022. In relation to such implementation, the provisions of Article 212-1-(b) of the FTC (i.e., the former French anti-hybrid provisions) have been repealed. Articles 205 B et seq. of the FTC implementing ATAD 2 provide limitations on interest deductions in the event of (i) a deduction of a payment at the level of a paying entity without a corresponding inclusion of such payment in the taxable income of the receiving entity (referred to as a “deduction without inclusion”), or (ii) a deduction of the same payment, operational expenses or losses in the taxable income of both the paying and receiving entity (referred to as a “Double Deduction”). Unlike the ----- previous domestic anti-hybrid rules, payments made to tax-exempt or low-taxed beneficiaries are not within the scope of the new rules that only target differences in qualification or attribution of the right to tax an element of income. Such limitations only apply to payments taking place between “associated enterprises,” except for the so-called “structured arrangements” (i.e., an arrangement pricing the relevant mismatch or an arrangement designed to produce the mismatch, subject to certain conditions). If the hybrid mismatch results in a deduction without inclusion, the deduction from taxable income will generally be denied to the French paying entity. Alternatively, the payment to a French receiving entity will be included in its taxable income if deduction is not denied in the jurisdiction of the paying entity. If the hybrid mismatch results in a Double Deduction, the deduction will either be denied at the level of the receiving entity or at the level of the paying entity. In respect of fiscal years opened as from January 1, 2022, these provisions also cover reverse hybrid entities, referring to situations where an entity is deemed to be tax transparent by the Member State in which it is incorporated or established but the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which its “associated enterprises” holding directly or indirectly in aggregate an interest in 50% or more of its voting rights, capital interests or rights to share profit are established, qualify the entity as non-transparent. Where a hybrid entity of a reverse hybrid mismatch is incorporated or established in France, its income is, as the case may be, either subject to French corporate income tax or taxable pursuant to the conditions provided for by Article 8 of the FTC, to the extent that it is not taxed in another State. In addition, the anti-abuse provision provided for by the ATAD with respect to French corporate income tax, which aims to address abusive tax practices that are not dealt with by specifically targeted provisions, was also implemented into French law. Pursuant to this provision, which is set forth by Article 205 A of the FTC, the French tax authorities may ignore, for the determination of corporate income tax, an arrangement, or a series of arrangements, which, having been put into place for the main purpose or one of the main purposes of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the applicable tax law, are not genuine, taking into consideration all of the relevant facts and circumstances. The above-mentioned tax rules, as well as generally applicable tax principles, may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on our indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness. _Our business may be adversely affected by an increase in the applicable VAT rates in the countries where we operate._ Our products are subject to VAT in each of the countries where we operate with different applicable rates set by each such country. As of December 31, 2023, the standard VAT rate was 20% in France, 21% in Belgium and 21% in Spain. From 2010 to 2012, European governments increased VAT rates in order to bolster public finances, and there can be no assurance that VAT rates will not be further increased in the future. Our published retail prices are inclusive of VAT. In a decision dated January 17, 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Council Directive 2006/112/EC of November 28, 2006 on the common system of value-added tax did not authorize Spain to apply a reduced rate of VAT to medical equipment, aid and devices of general use that were not normally intended to alleviate or treat personal disabilities. This decision prompted discussions in Spain regarding a potential increase in the VAT rate applicable to the sale of optical products to the 21% standard VAT rate. In order to adapt the legislation to what is established in the Court of Justice ruling, the Spanish legislator amended the list of goods subject to the reduced rate of 10% as from January 2015 and the entitlement to that reduced rate has been limited to, among other products, a narrower range of pharmaceutical products that can be used by the consumer, and medical equipment and devices (which include, among others, prescription glasses and contact lenses). Frames of prescription glasses and products related to the maintenance of contact lenses were later included within the list of products subject to the 10% reduced VAT rate, effective as from June 29, 2017. Accordingly, in Spain, a reduced VAT rate of 10% currently applies to prescription glasses, prescription eyeglass frames, contact lenses and the products necessary for the use, care and maintenance thereof. This reduced rate does not apply to other accessories, spares and replacement parts of such goods. In addition, the ----- Spanish General Directorate of Taxes has also ruled that this 10% reduced rate is not applicable to cases for lenses or glasses. Other jurisdictions of the European Union where we have operations apply reduced VAT rates to the sale of optical products and may be required to increase VAT rates to comply with European Union regulations. If VAT rates were to increase in the future or if the application of the reduced VAT rates were to be abandoned by the relevant jurisdictions, our profitability margins will be negatively impacted if we do not increase the prices of our products to match the increase in VAT. However, if we pass the increase in VAT on to our customers by raising the prices of our products, the demand for our products may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we face VAT risks arising out of our operating activities in the normal course of business and typical acquisition-related VAT risks relating to prior acquisitions and reorganizations. _The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._ The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Notes will be considered to be issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the Notes exceeds the issue price of the Notes (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount. In such event, investors in the Notes subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include such OID in their gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash payments attributable to such income, using the constant yield method.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Risks related to our indebtedness,13.7.1,,"_Our significant leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects and may make it difficult to operate our business._ We are highly leveraged. As of April 30, 2024, we had As adjusted net total debt (post-IFRS 16) of €623.9 million, of which €560.0 million was represented by the Notes offered hereby and €82.1 million was represented by IFRS 16 leases (net of sublease arrangements). In addition, as of April 30, 2024, on an As adjusted basis for the Transactions, the Issuer had €30.0 million available for drawing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. We also have significant commitments under our Guarantee Facilities (as defined under “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements”) in the amount of €11.8 million as of April 30, 2024, accounts receivable assignments and trade payables. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Off_balance sheet commitments”. The terms of the Indenture will allow the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, as applicable, to incur substantial additional indebtedness. Our significant leverage could have important consequences for our business and operations, including, but not limited to: - limiting our and our subsidiaries’ ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements; - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and liabilities; - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability, and reducing our flexibility to respond, to a downturn in our business or general economic or industry conditions; ----- - placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to competitors that have lower leverage or greater financial resources than we have; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to competition or changes in our business and industry; - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors; - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and - limiting, among other things, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings. Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital expenditures and other expenses will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate cash from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditures. In addition, we may be able to incur additional debt in the future, including indebtedness in connection with any future acquisition. The terms of the Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will permit our subsidiaries to do so, in each case, subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face could intensify. Moreover, certain of the debt we may incur in the future could be structurally senior to the Notes or may be secured by collateral that does not secure the Notes. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital resources”. We may incur substantially more debt in the future, including debt that is structurally senior to the Notes, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._ Despite our significant leverage, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. If any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries incurs additional indebtedness, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ahead of holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding-up of such subsidiaries. In addition, any debt ranking pari _passu with the Notes may be secured by certain assets of the Issuer and holders of that debt will not_ be required to share with holders of the Notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any enforcement of the security interests in such assets. Borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions, including the Notes, may as a result be accelerated and become due and payable. We may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances. Incremental debt at the level of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that has cash-pay interest will reduce the ability of the operating subsidiaries of the Issuer to upstream cash that could be used by the Issuer to make interest payments on the Notes from time to time and to pay principal at maturity of the Notes. Although the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the Indenture will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Moreover, the Indenture will not prevent us from incurring obligations or entering into other arrangements that do not constitute indebtedness under those agreements, such as receivables securitization financings. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and _Results of Operations—Liquidity and capital resources”. In addition, the terms of the Indenture will_ permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including in respect of certain other secured debt that shares in the Collateral on a first-priority, including super-senior, basis or second-priority basis. ----- Furthermore, the Indenture will allow our non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional debt that would be structurally senior to the Notes and will not prevent us from incurring liabilities that do not constitute “Indebtedness” as defined thereunder. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described in this Offering Memorandum. _We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful._ Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. Our ability to generate cash from operations is subject, in large part, to general economic, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or obtain enough capital to service our debt or fund our planned capital expenditure. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. _We can provide no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all._ Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indenture may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including under the Notes. In such an event, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture, may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including the Notes. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of sufficient cash flow generated from our operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under the Indenture, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition. We may not be able to consummate certain dispositions or to obtain the funds that we could have realized from the proceeds of such dispositions, and any proceeds we do realize from asset dispositions may not be adequate to meet any of our debt service obligations then due. ----- _We are subject to covenants which limit our operating and financial flexibility and, if we default under our debt covenants, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations._ The Indenture and the New Revolving Credit Facility will contain covenants that impose significant restrictions on the way the Issuer and the Group can operate, including restrictions on our ability to: - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock; - layer certain types of indebtedness; - create or incur certain liens; - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions; - prepay or redeem subordinated debt or equity; - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures; - engage in certain transactions with affiliates; - create unrestricted subsidiaries; - create encumbrances or restrictions on the payment of dividends or other distributions, loans or advances to, and on the transfer of, assets to the Issuer or any restricted subsidiary; - sell assets, consolidate or merge with or into other companies; - sell or transfer all or substantially all our assets or those of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; - impair security interests for the benefit of the holders of the Notes; - guarantee certain indebtedness of the Issuer and its subsidiaries; and - issue or sell share capital of certain subsidiaries. All of these limitations will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of _the Notes—Certain covenants”. These covenants could limit our ability to finance future operations and_ capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest. Our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control. These include prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, in addition to being in default under the Indenture and the Notes, we could be in default under the terms of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture, and the relevant lenders could elect to declare the debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, if any, immediately due and payable and proceed against any collateral securing that debt. This would also result in an event of default under the Indenture. If the debt under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Notes or the Guarantees or any other material financing arrangement that we enter into were to be accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay in full the Notes and our other debt. The New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement also requires our subsidiaries to maintain a minimum amount of EBITDA. The ability to meet this test could be affected by a deterioration in our operating results, as well as by events beyond our control, including increases in prices charged by our suppliers and unfavorable economic conditions, and there can be no assurances that this test will be met. In addition, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement includes certain affirmative covenants, as well as negative covenants similar to those under the Indenture. A breach of any of those covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. If our creditors, including the creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, accelerate the payment of amounts due under our various debt obligations, there can be no assurances that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other ----- liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts. See _“Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements—New Revolving Credit _Facility”._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,"Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral",13.8.1,,"_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of the Issuer’s non-guarantor subsidiaries._ As of the Issue Date, none of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes other than the Guarantors which will guarantee the Notes on a senior basis. The amount enforceable under the Guarantees is limited to the outstanding amount under the Notes Proceeds Loans. Aside from the Issuer, only 3AB Optique Développement, L’Opticien Afflelou and Alain Afflelou Franchiseur are party to Notes Proceeds Loans. The 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan is limited to €346.0 million, the Alain Afflelou Franchiseur Proceeds Loan is limited to €30.0 million and the L’Opticien Afflelou Proceeds Loan is limited to €20.0 million. Moreover, there are no restrictions on the repayment or cancellation of the Alain Afflelou Franchiseur Proceeds Loan and the L’Opticien Afflelou Proceeds Loan and only limited restrictions on the repayment or cancellation of the 3AB Optique Développement Proceeds Loan. Any such repayment or cancellation would reduce the relevant Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantees. Alain Afflelou International will not be party to any Notes Proceeds Loan. The validity and enforceability of the Guarantees are subject to limitations under applicable law. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor (such as Alain Afflelou International) may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. Other indebtedness of the relevant Guarantor may not be similarly limited. In addition, none of the non-guarantor subsidiaries will have any obligation to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries, including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the Issuer as a direct or indirect shareholder of such subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the Issuer (including the holders of the Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - the creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the Issuer, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries and our guarantor subsidiaries, except to the extent of the enforceable amounts of such guarantees. As of July 31, 2023, the Issuer’s subsidiaries had total debt (excluding the lease debt mainly at Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, Alain Afflelou Optico and L’Opticien Afflelou) of €0.2 million which remained outstanding following the refinancing we undertook in 2021 and accordingly will rank structurally senior to the Notes. Furthermore, certain of our indebtedness is guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries that do not also guarantee the Notes, primarily relating to guarantees given to banks on behalf of franchisees. In addition, direct shareholders of indirect non-guarantor subsidiaries of the Issuer and their creditors will also be entitled to payments from the assets of such subsidiaries before any distributions will be made to the Issuer as an indirect shareholder. _We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event as required by_ ----- _the Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events._ Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control triggering event”, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of purchase. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can be no assurances that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes or that the restrictions in the Indenture, the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the New Intercreditor Agreement or our other then-existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control triggering event may result in an acceleration of our New Revolving Credit Facility indebtedness or an event of default under the Indenture. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control triggering event itself does not. Under certain circumstances, a change of control triggering event under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement would, if so requested by a lender, result in the cancellation of such lender’s commitments and require the repayment of amounts outstanding under such lender’s commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and a change of control triggering event may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, other indebtedness. In addition, we may be required to repay a proportionate amount of debt under our New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement if we repay all or a portion of the principal under the Notes. The ability of the Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such a consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuer will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event. There can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase the Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control Triggering Event” (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, certain events that constitute a change of control triggering event under any one of the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or the Indenture may not constitute a change of control under the other agreements. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control triggering event will be deemed not to be a change of control triggering event, provided that a ratings downgrade has not occurred. In addition, even if a ratings downgrade has occurred, a change of control triggering event will not be deemed to have occurred if upon consummation thereto, a certain consolidated leverage ratio of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is met. The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise, established definition of that phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes. ----- _Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the Guarantees or the security interests may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Notes or security interests in the Collateral._ The Guarantors will guarantee and the Issuer and the Guarantors will provide security interests in respect of, the payment of the Notes on a first-ranking basis. The Issuer and the French Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of France and the Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Enforcement of the obligations under a Guarantee against the Guarantors or the enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral will be subject to certain defenses available to the Guarantors or the Issuer, as applicable, in the relevant jurisdiction, as the case may be. Although laws differ in these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses available to the Guarantors or the Issuer may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, voidable preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. Furthermore, the amounts recoverable under such Guarantees or Collateral, as applicable, will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed or secured by a particular Guarantor under French law, to the extent that the granting of such Guarantee or Collateral is not in the relevant Guarantor’s corporate interests, or the burden of such Guarantee or Collateral exceeds the benefit to the relevant Guarantor, or such Guarantee or Collateral would be in breach of capital maintenance, financial assistance, liquidity maintenance or thin capitalization rules or any other general statutory laws and/or would cause the directors of such Guarantor to contravene their fiduciary duties and incur civil or criminal liability. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under their respective Guarantees or the security interest in the Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Guarantees against the Guarantors or security interest in the Collateral against any of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The credit support under the Guarantees provided by the Guarantors organized under the laws of France is subject to: - French rules relating to financial assistance pursuant to which a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition or of the subscription of its shares, and the guarantee may not include any obligation which, if incurred, would constitute prohibited financial assistance, including, for example, within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Code de Commerce or an infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3 and L. 242-6 of the French Code de Commerce; - L. 244-1 of the French Code de Commerce (or any other laws or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts); and - French rules relating to corporate benefit: the grant of a guarantee by a French company for the obligations of another group company must be for the corporate benefit of the granting company. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not receive some real and adequate corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. The existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which must be determined on a case-bycase basis. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. The Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the Guarantors. However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee and the amounts recoverable will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering ----- its relevant Guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law, and enforcement of each Guarantee would be subject to certain generally available defenses. In addition, under French law, the Guarantees will be limited for each Guarantor to the aggregate amount of the Notes proceeds on-lent, directly or indirectly, to such Guarantor and outstanding from time to time. Any payment that will be made by such Guarantor under such proceeds loans would reduce the maximum amount of its Guarantee. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._ The granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company is subject to specific limitations and requirements arising from considerations related to its corporate object and corporate benefit. The granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company must come within its corporate object (“objet social”). In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of guarantees/security interests by a Luxembourg company must be in furtherance of its corporate benefit (“interêt social”). In particular, according to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg law dated 10 August 1915 on commercial companies, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”), it is a criminal offence for managers or directors of a company to use the assets or the credit of a company for a purpose which they know to be against the interest of the company in their personal interest, or in the interest of companies in which they are directly or indirectly interested. The granting of a guarantee or of a security interest in violation of article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law would constitute a criminal offence committed by the managers/directors of the company but there is also a risk that the guarantee/the security interest could be considered to be null and void. There is no relevant Luxembourg case law on the application of this provision to intra-group financing transactions. With respect to guarantee, regard may however be given to the situation in France as the Luxembourg legal provision on abuse of corporate assets is identical to the French provisions and Luxembourg courts tend to take into consideration French case law in respect of legal provisions which are similar in both jurisdictions. French case law has developed certain criteria under which a company may, in the absence of a direct own benefit, grant a guarantee for the obligations of another group company without violating French law provisions equivalent to article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law. In respect of guarantees, the following criteria, which have been used by the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation), may be used as a general guideline: - the transaction in the context of which the guarantee is granted is entered into with a view to furthering economic, social or financial interests within the framework of a common policy defined for the group as a whole; - the financial commitments (a) are entered into for consideration (not necessarily monetary) and (b) do not disturb the balance between the respective commitments of the group companies; and - the financial commitments do not exceed the financial capabilities of the company which bears the burden of such commitments. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is broadly interpreted and includes any transactions from which the Luxembourg company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit. The question as to whether there is sufficient corporate benefit for a company to grant a guarantee is very fact-based and is to be assessed by the managers/directors of the relevant company. The provision of a guarantee for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of guarantees in favor of companies who have the same direct or indirect shareholders as the Luxembourg company (cross-stream assistance) and companies who are the direct or indirect shareholder of the Luxembourg company, such as the Guarantees of the Luxembourg Guarantor, (upstream assistance) are less likely to directly benefit the guarantor. With respect to security interests, no issue should arise, in principle, in relation to cross-stream and upstream security interests, as such security interests are limited by nature to the assets subject to the relevant security interest (and can therefore not exceed the financial capabilities of the company required to grant such a security interest). ----- As a result, the Guarantees granted by the Luxembourg Guarantor may be subject to certain limitations, which will take the form of guarantee limitation language, which will be inserted in the New Intercreditor Agreement and which covers, subject to certain exceptions, the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under all the Finance Documents. For the sake of completeness, any security interests/guarantees granted by entities organized in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which constitute a breach of the provisions on financial assistance as defined by article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law or any other similar provisions (to the extent applicable, as at the date of this Offering Memorandum, to an entity organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg), might not be enforceable, if the specific requirements set out in the Luxembourg Companies Law are not met. Notably, under article 430-19 of the Luxembourg Companies Law, financial assistance consists of the advancement of funds, granting of loans or provision of security by a company with a view to the acquisition of its own shares by a third party. We do however take the view that the rules on financial assistance should not apply to the Guarantees by the Luxembourg Guarantor considering that such Guarantees are not granted with a view of the acquisition of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s shares. _The Notes, the Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral may be declared unenforceable against third parties under fraudulent conveyance laws._ French and Luxembourg laws contain similar specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy. These provisions offer creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which the person guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside bankruptcy of the relevant person by the bankruptcy trustee in a bankruptcy of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside bankruptcy, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties under both French and Luxembourg law if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the creditor concerned or, in the case of the person’s bankruptcy, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on grounds of fraudulent conveyance. In addition, in the case of the bankruptcy of the Luxembourg Guarantor, the liquidator, receiver, administrative receiver or administrator may nullify the debtor’s performance of any due and payable obligation (including (without limitation) an obligation to provide security for any of its or a third party’s obligations) if (i) the payee knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed at the moment of performance or (ii) the performance of the obligation was the result of a consultation between the debtor and the payee in order to give preference to the latter over the debtor’s other creditors. If a court finds that the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests the share pledges or bank accounts pledges, or the granting of a guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the share pledges or bank accounts pledges could be declared unenforceable or nullified. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not benefit from the Guarantees or the security interests in the share pledges, intragroup receivables or bank account pledges and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the security interests in the share pledges, intragroup receivables or bank account pledges or the Guarantees could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees. In addition, under such circumstances, holders of the Notes might be held liable for any damages incurred by prejudiced creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors as a result of the fraudulent conveyance. See “Certain _Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—France” and “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—Luxembourg”._ ----- _Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes or under the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._ The Notes will be issued by the Issuer, a company organized and established under the laws of France, and will be guaranteed by the French Guarantors, which are organized under the laws of France and the Luxembourg Guarantor, which is organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The Notes will be secured by security interests in the Collateral provided by the Guarantors and the Issuer. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. The rights of holders of the Notes under the Guarantees or under security interests in the Collateral will thus be subject to the laws of a number of jurisdictions, and it may be difficult to enforce such rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administration and other laws of France and Luxembourg may be materially different from, or in conflict with, one another, including creditors’ rights, the priority of creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings. The application of these various laws in these jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply and could adversely affect the ability to realize any recovery under the Notes and the Guarantees or under security interests in the Collateral. Moreover, in certain jurisdictions, it is unclear whether all security interests in the Collateral give the Security Agent a right to prevent other creditors from foreclosing on and realizing the Collateral or whether certain security interests only give the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes priority (according to their rank) in the distribution of any proceeds of such realization. Accordingly, the Security Agent and the holders of the Notes may not be able to avoid foreclosure by other creditors (including unsecured creditors) on the Collateral. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on _the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”._ Under Luxembourg and French law, enforcement of a security interest in the Collateral provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, may be adversely affected by specific or general defenses available to debtors under Luxembourg or French law, as the case may be, in respect of the validity, binding effect and enforceability of such security interest. _The insolvency and administrative laws of France and Luxembourg, as the case may be, may not be favorable to creditors, including investors in the Notes, and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral._ The Notes will be issued by the Issuer and will be guaranteed by the Guarantors, which are organized and existing under the laws of France or, in the case of the Luxembourg Guarantor, Luxembourg. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in France or Luxembourg. Proceedings could also be initiated in France or Luxembourg to enforce your rights against Collateral located in those jurisdictions. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to enforce your rights effectively in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, while the Luxembourg Guarantor conducts the majority of its business in Luxembourg, to the extent that its center of main interests is deemed to be in France, it would be subject to French insolvency proceedings, including court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc or conciliation proceedings) and court-controlled insolvency proceedings (sauvegarde), accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure _de sauvegarde accélérée), or reorganization or liquidation proceedings (redressement or liquidation judiciaire). In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection_ of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit the ability of holders of the Notes to enforce their rights. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests—France”._ ----- In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ jurisdiction of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. Finally, pursuant to the European Parliament and the Council Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings, the court that shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company has its “center of main interests”. Therefore, to the extent that the “center of main interests” of the Issuer is deemed to be in France, French courts may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the Issuer. _Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._ The Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries are organized outside the United States, and their business is conducted entirely outside the United States. All of the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors are nonresidents of the United States. Although the Issuer and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process in the United States on the directors and executive officers of the Issuer and the Guarantors. In addition, because all of the assets the Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in U.S. courts. Moreover, actions of the Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with France or Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in France or Luxembourg of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France or Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in France or Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a French or Luxembourg court would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in France or Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information, see “Service of _Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities”. Creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the terms of the Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement to rank pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility are entitled to be repaid with recoveries from the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority over the Notes._ The New Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of recoveries from guarantee claims and proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral. Such recoveries and enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes or the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Security Agent is required to pay turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions to discharge obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness in priority to paying any such amounts to discharge the Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, you may not benefit from such recoveries if the then outstanding claims under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and such hedging obligations and, if applicable future Indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the New Revolving Credit Facility under the ----- application of proceeds provisions in New Intercreditor Agreement have been discharged, be applied _pro rata in repayment of the Notes and, if applicable, future indebtedness that ranks pari passu with the_ Notes under the application of proceeds provisions of the New Intercreditor Agreement. Furthermore, claims of our secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. _The granting of the security interests in the Collateral may create hardening periods for such security interests in accordance with the law applicable in France._ The granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Notes may create hardening periods for such security interests in France. The applicable hardening period for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted, perfected or recreated. In addition, the Indenture will permit the security interests in the Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Such release and retaking will restart the applicable hardening periods. Moreover, the granting of a shared security interest to secure future indebtedness may restart or reopen hardening periods in France. The applicable hardening period may run from the moment such new security is amended, granted or perfected. In each case, if the security interest granted, perfected or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. See “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”. _You may be required to pay a “soulte” in the event you decide to enforce the securities account by judicial or contractual foreclosure of the Collateral consisting of shares rather than by a sale of such Collateral in a public auction._ Security interests governed by French law may only secure a creditor up to the secured amount that is due and unpaid to it. Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over a securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an ----- investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. _It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._ The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted under the Indenture and/or the New Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by other creditors that have the benefit of first-ranking security interests in the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time, whether on or after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, prior statutory or other liens, in particular in cases where lien searches are not available (for instance, for pledges over bank accounts or pledges over receivables). In France and Luxembourg, no lien searches are available for security interests that are not registered, including pledges over securities accounts, bank accounts or receivables. As a result, there can be no assurances as to the priority of the French and Luxembourg law-governed pledges over the Collateral comprising assets of these types. The ranking of security interests can also be affected by the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. There can be no assurances that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease. _Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._ The Notes will be secured on a first-priority basis by the Collateral, which will also secure the obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness (the “Super Senior Liabilities”). The Indenture will also permit the Collateral to secure additional indebtedness in accordance with the terms thereof and the New Intercreditor Agreement. The New Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent will only enforce the Collateral as provided for in the New Intercreditor Agreement, and regulates the ability of the Trustees or the holders of the Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Security Agent is not required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an instructing group that consists of the holders of the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, creditors in respect of indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes and creditors in respect of certain non-priority hedging obligations (the “Senior **Secured** **Credit",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,Participations”) which aggregate more than 50.1% of the total Senior Secured Credit Participations at,13.9.1,,"that time (the “Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representatives). However, if and to the extent the obligations under the Super Senior Liabilities have not been fully discharged in cash within six months of such enforcement instructions first being issued or if Security Agent has not commenced enforcement action within three months of enforcement instructions first being issued or certain insolvency events occur and the Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action, then the enforcement instructions provided by creditors holding more than 66.66% of the indebtedness and commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) will prevail. ----- Following the transaction security having become enforceable, a creditor representative acting on behalf of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders may at any time provide immediate enforcement instructions to the Security Agent if the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders determine in good faith that to delay the taking of any enforcement action could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce any transaction security or the realization of enforcement proceeds. In such circumstances, the Security Agent shall act only with respect to the relevant asset or debtor that is the subject of such determination, in accordance with the first such notice of such determination and instructions as to enforcement received by the Security Agent, provided in each case that they are consistent with certain security enforcement principles. If at any time an insolvency event has occurred with respect to any debtor (other than an insolvency event which is the direct result of any action taken by the Security Agent acting on the instructions of the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders), the Security Agent shall act, to the extent the Majority Super Senior Creditors have provided such instructions, in accordance with the instructions received from the Majority Super Senior Creditors, provided that in the event the Security Agent has received proposed enforcement instructions from the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders and has commenced enforcement action pursuant to such instructions, the Security Agent shall continue to act in accordance with the instructions of the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders until such time as the representative for the Majority Super Senior Creditors issues enforcement instructions to the Security Agent and such instructions shall override and supersede any such prior instructions given by the creditor representative for the Notes/Pari Passu Required Holders. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness that is secured on a pari passu basis with the Notes, the voting interest of holders of such Notes in an instructing group will be diluted commensurate with the amount of indebtedness we incur. The lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and the creditors in respect of certain priority hedging obligations may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral consisting of the shares of any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the New Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Guarantees and the liens over any other assets of such entities securing the Notes and the Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness— _New Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens”._ Delays in enforcement could decrease or eliminate recovery values. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce, or have recourse to, any of the Security Documents or to exercise any rights or powers arising under the Security Documents, except through the Security Agent as provided in the New Intercreditor Agreement. By accepting the Notes, you will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Notes will have limited remedies and recourse against the Issuer and the Guarantors in the event of a default. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness—New Intercreditor Agreement”. _The Issuer and the Guarantors will have control over the Collateral securing the Notes, and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._ The Security Documents relating to the Notes will allow the Issuer and the Guarantors to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral securing the Notes to the extent that it relates to their assets. So long as no enforcement event has occurred, the Issuer and the Guarantors may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of the Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. ----- _The Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated in Luxembourg, and Luxembourg law differs from U.S. law and may afford less protection to holders of the Notes._ Holders of the Notes may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would security holders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. As a Luxembourg company, the Luxembourg Guarantor is incorporated under and subject to the Luxembourg Companies Law and other provisions of Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Companies Law differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and security holders, including the provisions relating to interested directors, mergers, amalgamations and acquisitions, takeovers, security holder lawsuits and indemnification of directors. Under Luxembourg law, the duties of directors and managers of a company are generally owed to the company only. Security holders of Luxembourg companies generally do not have rights to take action against directors or managers of the company, except in limited circumstances. Directors or managers of a Luxembourg company must, in exercising their powers and performing their duties, act in good faith and in the interests of the company as a whole and must exercise due care, skill and diligence. Directors or managers have a duty not to put themselves in a position in which their duties to the company and their personal interests may conflict and also are under a duty to disclose any personal interest in any contract or arrangement with the company or any of its subsidiaries. If a director or manager of a Luxembourg company is found to have breached his or her duties to that company, he or she may be held personally liable to the company in respect of that breach of duty. A director or manager may be jointly and severally liable with other directors implicated in the same breach of duty. _The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances._ For a description of the security over the Collateral, see “Description of the Notes— Security”. In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this Offering. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among others, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located, the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the New Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of certain Collateral, the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility or certain hedging obligations and certain future indebtedness will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders of the Notes. The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, there can be no assurances that the Collateral will be salable or, if salable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes, and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Collateral may decline over time. The Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties have liens on the Collateral, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral which, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. Moreover, if we issue additional notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same collateral as the holders of the Notes, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from ----- the liens on the Collateral. Although we will be subject, under the Indenture, to certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness that will be secured by the Collateral including, in the case of the Indenture, a Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined and described under “Description of the Notes— Certain covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness”), the definition of Senior Secured Indebtedness (as defined under “Description of the Notes”) for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Senior Secured Leverage Ratio contains certain important exceptions and carve-outs. _The security over the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes._ The security interests in the Collateral that will secure the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their respective Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Indenture and the New Intercreditor will provide that only the Security Agent as security agent, trustee and Parallel Debt (as defined below) creditor has the right to enforce the Security Documents. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Trustee under the Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Under French law the pledgee of a French law security interest and the creditor of the claim secured by such security interest are required to be the same person and such security interest cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary (fiduciaire) under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et _seq. of the French Civil Code. The beneficial holders of interests in the Notes from time to time will not_ be parties to the Security Documents. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the New Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of “parallel debt” obligations in favor of the Security Agent (the “Parallel Debt”) mirroring the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors (as principal obligors) towards the holders of the Notes under or in connection with the Indenture (the “Principal Obligations”). The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French or Luxembourg law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). None of the Parallel Debt and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French courts and to the extent that the Notes or security interests in the Collateral created under the Parallel Debt and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the Guarantees or security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the creditor of the Parallel Debt. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recognized, in a decision on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. 13 September 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) relating to bond documentation governed by New York law, the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. Case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case by case analysis. Such ----- a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the FTC and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. 13 September_ 2011 n°10-25.533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of _inter alios the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. In addition, the holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Trustee. _The Notes and the Guarantees will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes or the Guarantees._ If there is an event of default in respect of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be secured only to the extent of the value of the assets that have been granted as security for the Notes or the Guarantees. In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as a result of the creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Indenture may require, subject to local law limitations, such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Indenture contain a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances. The operation of the agreed security principles may result in, among other things, the amount recoverable under any Collateral provided being limited or security not being granted or perfected over a particular type or class of assets. Accordingly, the agreed security principles may affect the value of the security provided by the Issuer and the Guarantors. To the extent that the claims of the holders of the Notes exceed the value of the assets securing those Notes and other obligations, those claims will rank equally with the claims of the holders of all other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Notes. As a result, if the value of the assets pledged as security for the Notes is less than the value of the claims of the holders of the Notes, those claims may not be satisfied in full before the claims of certain unsecured creditors are paid. ----- _Investors’ rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._ Applicable law may require that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions it is directed to take by the relevant group of creditors, which are necessary to perfect any such security interests. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Collateral securing the Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that we will inform the Security Agent of the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. Additionally, the Indenture and the Security Documents entered into in connection with the Notes will not require us to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the security interests of the Security Agent in the Collateral. To the extent that the security interests created by the Security Documents with respect to any Collateral are not perfected, the Security Agent’s rights will be equal to the rights of general unsecured creditors in the event of a liquidation, foreclosure, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding. _There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustees._ Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically as described under “Description of the Notes—Security—Release of Liens” including: - in connection with any sale or other disposition of property or assets constituting Collateral (as applicable), if the sale or other disposition does not violate the “— Limitation on Sales of assets _and subsidiary stock” covenant, as described under “Description of the Notes” and is otherwise in_ compliance with the Indenture; - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of an Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Guarantor; - the property and assets and shares of a restricted subsidiary designated as an unrestricted subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture; - upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge” under “Description of the Notes”; - in accordance with the New Intercreditor Agreement, or any additional intercreditor agreement; - as described in the section “—Amendments and waivers” under “Description of the Notes”. - as permitted by the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants— _Impairment of Security Interest” and as described in the section “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants— Limitation on Liens” and as permitted in accordance with the Indenture;_ - in connection with a transaction permitted by “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants— _Merger and consolidation” and in compliance with the Indenture;_ ----- - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization as described under “Description of the Notes”; - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations of the Notes or legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Notes, as provided in the section entitled “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge” under “Description of the Notes”; and - as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture. Under various circumstances, the Guarantees will be released automatically as described under “Description of the Notes—Release” including: - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the capital stock of the relevant Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor, if the sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described below “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants—Limitation on sales of assets and subsidiary stock” and is otherwise in compliance with the Indenture; - upon the designation in accordance with the Indenture of the Guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary; - upon defeasance or discharge of the Notes, as provided in the section entitled “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and discharge” under “Description of the Notes”; - in accordance with the New Intercreditor Agreement or any additional intercreditor agreement; - as described under “Description of the Notes—Amendments and waivers”; - as described in the covenant described under “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants— _Additional Guarantees”;_ - in connection with a transaction permitted by “Description of the Notes—Certain covenants— _Merger and consolidation” and in compliance with the Indenture;_ - upon payment full and final payment and performance of all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes; and - in connection with a Permitted Reorganization as described under “Description of the Notes”. _Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._ The Notes will be denominated and payable in euro. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than the euro, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchangerelated risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the euro relative to the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments because of economic, political and other factors which affect currency exchange rates over which we have no control. Depreciation of the euro against the currency by reference to which an investor measures the return on his or her investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investor measures the return on his or her investments. Investments in the Notes, including by US holders (as defined in “Certain tax considerations—Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations”) who use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency may also have important tax consequences as a result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. Investors in the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax consequences of acquiring, owning or disposing of the Notes. ----- _Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._ One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed above and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost, terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes. _Transfer of the Notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the Notes._ Because the Notes have not or will not have been, and are not required to be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, they may not be offered or sold in the United States except to QIBs in accordance with Rule 144A, in offshore transactions in accordance with Regulation S or pursuant to another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and all other applicable laws. These restrictions may limit the ability of investors to resell the Notes. It is the obligation of investors in the Notes to ensure that all offers and sales of the Notes in the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. For further information, see “Transfer restrictions”. _The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore investors must rely on the procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._ The Notes will initially only be issued in global certificated form and held through Euroclear and Clearstream. Interests in the Global Notes (as defined under “Book-entry; Delivery and Form”) will trade in book-entry form only, and Notes in definitive registered form, or Definitive Registered Notes (as defined under “Book-entry; Delivery and Form”), will be issued in exchange for book-entry interests only in very limited circumstances. Owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary, or its nominee, for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the Global Notes representing the Notes. Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Global Notes representing the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the Global Notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Notes under the Indenture. Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to act upon the Issuer’s solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, they will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies may not be sufficient to enable such investor to vote on a timely basis. Similarly, upon the occurrence of an “Event of Default” under the Indenture, unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if investors own book-entry interests, they will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. The procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream may not be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes and the Indenture. See “Book-entry; Delivery and Form”. ----- _There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited._ The Notes are new issues of securities for which there are currently no established trading markets. There can be no assurances as to: - the number of holders of the Notes; - the market for similar securities; - the liquidity of any market in the Notes; - your ability to sell the Notes; or - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes. Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment-grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. There can be no assurances that the market, for the Notes, if any, will be free from similar disruptions and any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. Therefore, there can be no assurances that you will be able to sell the Notes at a particular time or the price that you receive when you sell the Notes will be favorable. The Initial Purchasers have advised that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing this Offering. However, they have no obligation to do so and may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice. In addition, such market-making activity will be subject to limitations imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and other applicable laws and regulations. As a result, there may not be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your Notes at a fair value, if at all. _The Notes may not become, or remain, listed Official List of Euronext Dublin._ Although the Issuer will, in the Indenture, agree to use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Notes listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof after the Issue Date and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, there can be no assurances that the Notes will become, or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin and the admission to trading on the Global Exchange Market or it becomes unduly burdensome to make or maintain such listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin, provided that the Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain (prior to the delisting of the Notes, if applicable) and maintain the listing of the Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so. Although no assurance can be made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the Euronext Dublin or another recognized listing exchange for comparable issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Euronext Dublin or another listing exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market. _The proposed financial transactions tax (FTT) may apply and impact dealings in the Notes._ On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.10,"Proposal”) for a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France,",13.10.1,,"Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (together, except for Estonia, the “Participating Member States”) and which, if enacted and implemented by France, should replace the French FTT. Following ----- the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (the “ECOFIN”) meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on FTT. The Commission’s Proposal has a very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. At the ECOFIN meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model that in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval is made. In February 2021, the Portuguese Presidency of the Council of the European Union proposed an inclusive discussion among all Member States on tax design issues of the FTT. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member States, the potential adoption of such tax and its scope being therefore uncertain. Additional Member States may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. If the proposed directive or any similar taxes are adopted, such taxes could increase the transaction costs associated with the purchases and sales of the Notes and could reduce liquidity in the market for the Notes. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"Our main business consists of our franchisor activity in the optical and hearing aid product markets. As franchisor, we provide our franchisees with a full range of solutions and services, making our networks, industry know-how and business practices available to them, while also marketing and promoting our networks and offering a broad, appealing range of purchasing solutions, including exclusive product offers. All of these products and services maintain brand appeal and pave the way for the development of our franchisees. In exchange for these services and the exclusive products provided to franchisees, we charge the cost of goods as well as fees and other contributions to our franchisees (in accordance with franchise agreements) and to network suppliers. ----- Furthermore, to support our networks, we also directly own a number of optical and hearing aid product stores. The three-part objective of our directly-owned stores is to support our franchisor activity as follows: - maintain complete control over flagship stores in strategic areas in terms of customer bases, as these stores are considered to be showcases for our networks; - operate a portfolio of stores to test new business initiatives, product concepts and innovations and identify best practices in operations and distribution before rolling them out across the network; and - manage the store network by temporarily operating stores where a franchisee is retiring or experiencing financial difficulties. In these cases, we acquire the stores to keep them within the network, with the objective of transferring them to new franchisees in the short- to mid-term. We recognize the following geographical segments in accordance with IFRS 8 – Operating Segments: - **_France. The France segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of franchised and directly-owned stores in France (as well as the activities of Malentille.com), accounted for 75.9% of network sales and 75.5% of our revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024. As of April 30, 2024, we had a total of 914 stores in France, of which 76 were directly-owned; - **_Spain. The “Spain” segment, which includes the optical and hearing aid businesses of franchised and directly-owned stores in Spain (including Andorra), accounted for 16.4% of network sales and 20.6% of our revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024. As of April 30, 2024, we had a total of 368 stores in Spain, of which 89 were directly-owned stores; and - **_Other countries. The “Other countries” segment, which includes the optical business in countries outside France and Spain, accounted for 7.8% of network sales and 3.9% of our revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024. As of April 30, 2024, we had a total of 152 stores in our Other countries segment, of which 6 were directly-owned stores in Portugal. See “Presentation of _Financial and Other Information—Segment Information”._ We generate revenue through (i) network sales revenue, mainly comprising fees, contributions and other revenue collected by us on franchisee sales in exchange for the various services we provide them as franchisor; (ii) network purchases revenue; and (iii) revenue from directly-owned stores. These sources of revenue are further described below. - **_Network sales revenue (i). Network sales revenue is mainly derived from fees calculated on the basis of a percentage of the sales reported by the network of franchised stores and from initial one-time network entry fees. Network sales revenue represented 26.6% of our revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 and 27.8% of network sales over the same period. These fees and contributions mainly comprise the following items: - _Entry fees and royalties. Our store network benefits from the industry know-how and commercial expertise that we have developed over the years, as well as from our strong brand recognition and reputation. We are responsible for formulating a commercial strategy, which is supported by innovative offers, the development of products and services and the sharing of best practices within the store network. In exchange for our know-how, the right to use one of our brands and operate under one of our networks, and the allocation of an exclusive geographical area, we charge franchisees an initial one-time entry fee. For example, we charge entry fees of up to €50,000 for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France. For all of our networks, we charge monthly royalties which are calculated as a percentage of a store’s monthly sales excluding VAT, which, for example, are set at a standard 4.15% rate for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France and at a standard 4.23% rate for ALAIN AFFLELOU in Spain. - _Communications. We are responsible for the development and implementation of our network’s advertising and communications strategy, using different types of media (TV, radio) ----- on a local level as well as on national levels to promote our brands, product offerings and commercial offers. In exchange for the communications services we provide, we receive communication fees from stores in the network, which are calculated as a percentage of a store’s monthly sales including VAT, which for example are set at 7.3% for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France (including VAT) and 8.34% for ALAIN AFFLELOU in Spain (excluding VAT). Communication activity also includes special services charged to the store network as part of local communications campaigns. In addition, revenue derived from communications activities includes sales of display models of exclusive eyeglass frames to stores in the network (however, this revenue is eliminated in the consolidation, as it is also reflected in our exclusive product trading revenue). - _Other. These contributions comprise various services charged to the store network, such as training and overhead (e.g., IT expenses), as well as various fees charged to suppliers and service providers for network commercial offers. - **_Network purchases revenue (ii)._** Network purchases revenue is derived from listing- and licensing-related fees charged to suppliers on their sales to franchisees, and wholesale activity consisting of product sales to franchisees through central purchasing units and our exclusive eyeglass frames and sunglasses trading activity. Our network purchases revenue represented 43.9% of revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024 and 41.4% of network sales over the same period. Network purchases revenue comprises the following types of revenue: - _Central listing and payment units._ Stores in the network are required to purchase all the products they sell exclusively from suppliers that are listed by our central listing and payment units. On behalf of stores in the network, we negotiate purchasing terms with these suppliers and operate central listing and payment units to optimize the supply and payment of products for both suppliers and stores in the network. The central listing and payment units afford suppliers the advantage of a single commercial and financial counterparty for the entire network, in addition to guaranteed settlements from the network’s franchisees. In exchange for these listing and payment services, we charge listed suppliers listing fees (comprising listing commissions, del credere commissions relating to supplier payment guarantees and early payment allowances). Such listing fees are calculated as a percentage of a listed supplier’s sales to stores in the network. - _Central purchasing units. Stores in the network purchase products either directly from listed suppliers or through our central purchasing units in France, Spain and Belgium. Our central purchasing units primarily cover the purchase of eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and Afflelou-exclusive frames and sunglasses. This system helps network franchisees receive additional discounts, of which we receive a share. - _Licensing._ We provide stores in the network our own-brand eyeglass lenses and contact lenses, which are manufactured by third parties and distributed by us through our central purchasing units or directly by listed suppliers. We charge third-party manufacturers of our own-brand eyeglass lenses and contact lenses a licensing fee for the use of certain brand names, which are calculated as a percentage of the supplier’s sales to stores in the network. - _Exclusive product trading. We act as a wholesaler by selling exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in the network either through logistics providers or directly. Exclusive products include: (i) proprietary frames and sunglasses, which are frames and sunglasses selected by us, manufactured by subcontractors according to our specifications and sold under our own brands, such as the “Afflelou” signature label; (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses, which are frames selected by us, manufactured by subcontractors according to our specifications and marketed under third-party brands; and (iii) other exclusive brands and third-party names, which are designed and manufactured by third parties for exclusive distribution in the store network. As part of our trading activities, we retain a margin on the sale of exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in the network. ----- - **_Directly-owned stores revenue (iii). We also generate revenue from sales to end customers at directly-owned stores. The directly-owned store network’s contribution to our costs (such as rent and personnel costs) and revenue represents a relatively substantial portion of overall costs and revenue, as it corresponds to the costs and sales of the stores (borne by us), whereas the franchisor activity is largely based on royalties collected from network sales and the sale of products to franchisees. At April 30, 2024, we operated 76 directly-owned stores in France, 89 directly-owned stores in Spain, and six directly-owned stores in Other countries (in Portugal). Revenue from directly-owned stores accounted for 29.6% of revenue for the nine months ended April 30, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

While our optical sales performed well in all of our geographies, our hearing aid activity recorded contrasted performance across our different geographies during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, with a decline in France due to the regularization of the market as a result of a continued slowdown after the implementation of _100% Santé in 2021, and simultaneous rapid growth of this business in Spain. _France_ In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our total network sales in France reported an overall growth of 5.0% to €667.1 million compared to €635.7 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. This increase was due a growth of 6.4% in our optical business. Our optical business significantly outperformed the market, which increased by of 4.0% (like-for-like sales) as estimated by Xerfi and by 4.1% (total sales) as estimated by GfK. During this same period, our hearing aid business recorded a decline of 8.3%, an evolution consistent with the overall market which declined by approximately 7% in the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, as reported by sales volume estimates recorded by the suppliers union in the hearing aids sector. Notwithstanding this decline, we have continued to strongly expand our footprint of hearing aid points of sale. _Spain_ In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our total network sales in Spain increased by 10.5% to €141.3 million compared to €127.9 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. This increase was due to growth of our (i) optical sales which grew by 7.8%, strongly outperforming the market and (ii) hearing aid business which grew by 92.8%. We aim to increase our hearing aid sales in Spain, which currently represents approximately 5.8% of our optical sales, so that it reaches the same proportion of total network sales in France, where hearing aid sales currently represent 9.1% of our optical sales. ----- _Other countries_ In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our total network sales in the Other countries segment recorded growth of 7.3% to €67.6 million compared to €63.0 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. This positive performance stems from the expansion of our network with solid partners in most areas of operation in this segment. _Nine months ended April 30, 2024_ Network sales increased by 5.4% to €677.7 million during the nine months ended April 30, 2024 compared to €643.2 million during the nine months ended April 30, 2023. _France_ Network sales in France increased by 4.5% in the nine months ended April 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. Our optical business continued to grow well, despite a limited communication presence prior to our new communication campaign that started in April. In addition to the solid performance at our optical business, our hearing aid business continued its progressive recovery, with an increase in network sales of 1.9% during the nine months ended April 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. The positive sales performance at our hearing network were accompanied as in past periods by the continued expansion of our network which reached 394 points of sales as at the end of April 2024 (of which 292 were corners inside optical stores). _Spain_ In the nine months ended April 30, 2024, network sales in Spain reported a total growth of 8.3% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. In this same period, our hearing aid business continued to record strong growth of 51.2% compared to nine months ended April 30, 2023. This performance was supported by a rapid expansion of the network to 152 points of sales as at April 30, 2024 compared to 117 points of sales as at April 30, 2023. _Other countries_ Network sales in the Other countries segment grew during the nine months ended April 30, 2024 to €52.6 million, or 7.9%, compared to the nine months ended April 30, 2023. Sales in Belgium represented an increase of 7.8% on a cumulated basis in the nine months ended April 30, 2024. This increase stems from solid commercial performance compared to a slightly negative evolution in the past year. Our sales in Belgium allowed us to confidently launch our hearing aid business. We have 13 hearing aid corners inside our Belgium network of 50 stores. In Switzerland, sales continued to record growth of 6.4%. The sales in the other international areas continued to grow, with solid performance in Portugal and Morocco, together making up more than 20 stores.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In addition to expanding network sales generally, like-for-like network sales growth is another important indicator of the performance of our store network. For a definition of like-for-like network sales growth, see footnote 4 under “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Data— _Operating and segment information”. In countries such as France and Spain, where we already have a_ significant store network, the size of the existing network plays a critical role in the overall growth of network sales. Further illustrating this, in a given period new stores only account for a small percentage of network sales. We analyze network sales growth on a like-for-like basis in France, Spain and the Other countries segment to assess the evolution of the performance of existing stores, excluding the effects of network expansion. Nevertheless, in the fast growing segment of our hearing aid business in Spain and in France, where our network grows rapidly in terms of points of sale, through the opening of corners to complement our optical activity, the like-for-like evolution is less meaningful, especially as corners may not be operated on a daily basis by an audio-prosthetist. Growth in like-for-like network sales is thanks to our implementation of commercial offers and policies and the marketing communications that promote them, but it is also due to the initiatives of local stores run by franchisees, which receive additional support from our sales management teams. Like-for-like network sales correspond to sales generated by stores which were open throughout the periods under review, based on a full fiscal year, and which did not undergo any substantial changes during such periods (such as construction or refurbishment work with a duration of more than one month), for sales performance in a period to be comparable to that of the prior period. The calculation of like-for-like network sales does not take store closures in connection with COVID-19 into account. Like-for-like network sales are calculated at constant exchange rates (applying the prior year’s exchange rates to the current year), as a very small portion of network sales are currently exposed to currency risk. Like-for-like network sales growth has not been adjusted based on the potential impact on network sales resulting from the different number of working days between two periods.

Following our decision in late 2022 to focus on our development of the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner, the total number of stores bearing our Optical Discount brand declined by 66 stores during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. As a consequence, in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the total number of stores, including the discount banner, declined by 21 stores to 1,440 stores, compared to 1,461 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Our strategy to focus on ALAIN AFFLELOU allowed us to accelerate the expansion during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, of our historical banner, including moving a few of our stores that fell under the discount banner to the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner. We also believe that focusing on our historical banner reinforces its leading brand awareness and the capacity to grow more rapidly our hearing aid banner, like in Spain where this activity has witnessed a rapid expansion in the past two fiscal years. Today, we operate under one banner: ALAIN AFFLELOU which includes geographical networks and specific audio and optical networks. Since the start of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 we have been focused on the following action items: - a review of white space potential, together with a review of such potential with our existing franchisees, with around 150 locations identified for new store openings; - a communication plan that began in spring 2023 to attract new franchisee candidates, through professional and social media outreach in the optical sector; and - a program dedicated to our store managers to allow them to become franchisees, with buy back plans of some of our directly-owned stores. We believe our strategy to attract new franchisee candidates is key since we are facing a growing shortage of health professionals in both our hearing aid and optical businesses. The Adelante support we provide to franchisees also allows us to attract new candidates. As of July 31, 2023, approximately 140 of our stores in Spain and France have benefitted from our Adelante financial support program. Some stores have already been sold back to franchisees with a renewed capacity to grow sales, with limited expense on our side. As a result, the number of our directly-owned stores declined to 177 stores as at July 31, 2023 compared to 183 as at July 31, 2022, and this decline is expected to continue in France, with a long term aim of maintaining a proportion of approximately 10.0% directly-owned stores in our structure. _France_ Our French ALAIN AFFLELOU network increased by 28 stores for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our optical and hearing networks reached 908 stores compared to 882 stores for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Despite the more challenging outlook in the sector, ----- our hearing aid business continued to expand, with 376 points of sale, including 276 corners and 100 exclusive hearing aid centers for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, compared to 343 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 (including 251 corners and 92 centers). Lastly, we have reduced our directly-owned stores perimeter to 83 stores for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, compared to 93 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, mainly through the sale of the stores we acquired in Normandy. In addition, we made the decision to focus our directly-owned store concentration in the Paris region, and on larger stores elsewhere in France, with an aim to sell additional directly-owned stores not corresponding to these criteria in the current fiscal year. _Spain_ In Spain, our store count grew by nine stores for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 to 363 stores. Following our decision to re-launch our hearing aid business, the network now comprises eight dedicated centers and 119 corners. In Spain, like in France, our strategy to grow synergies between the two businesses includes a growing coverage of the optical network through the proportion of optical stores with hearing aid corners. This proportion reached around one-third in both countries. _Other countries_ Our network in the Other countries segment grew by ten stores, to 147 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 compared to 137 for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. We have a solid base in Switzerland and Belux with 20 stores and 54 stores in such regions, respectively. In each of those areas, we aim to expand the hearing aid business, as well as to grow our optical portfolio in the non-French speaking regions. In Belgium, we have started the expansion of our hearing aids business with seven corners opened during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. In Portugal, we have continued to grow our portfolio by three stores in the prior fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, reaching a portfolio of 26 stores, including six directly-owned stores. In the other international areas, we have continued to expand our footprint in the Middle East, where we have a total of 14 stores in Kuwait, Lebanon, United Arab Emirates, Armenia and Georgia, as at July 31, 2023. In Maghreb, we have 25 stores in Algeria and Morocco, with a strong position of 20 stores in Morocco, as at July 31, 2023. We plan to continue our expansion in the Middle East, especially in the Arabian Peninsula in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, where our performance has been positive since its inception. _Nine months ended April 30, 2024_ Our total store count increased by 37 stores to 1,434 stores as of April 30, 2024 compared to 1,397 stores as of April 30, 2023. Our portfolio of stores now consists of stores managed under ALAIN AFFLELOU (i.e. optical, hearing aid, and Alain Afflelou opticien & acousticien). Optical Discount is not included as we made the decision to progressively discontinue Optical Discount. During this period, our portfolio continued to develop well, with a net addition of 12 stores and overall growth of 37 stores compared to April 30, 2023 (excluding the expansion at our hearing aid network through the openings of 70 corners inside optical stores). _France_ Our total ALAIN AFFLELOU store count in France increased by 14 stores as at April 30, 2024 compared to April 30, 2023 as a result of various initiatives like our _Adelante_ program, targeted marketing to opticians demonstrating the benefits brought by joining ALAIN AFFLELOU as a franchisee, and allocating more resources to our internal Development Teams. The overall growth of our network also included the expansion of our hearing aid store count, with six additional centers (only dedicated to hearing aids) compared to April 30, 2023, and a total of 38 additional points of sales (including both centers and corners) now accounting for 394 points of sales compared to 356 as at April 30, 2023. Finally, we continued our plan to reduce our directly-owned stores portfolio, with the aim to focus on the Paris region, large profitable stores, and geographical and profitable clusters like we have in the Bordeaux region. The total number of directly-owned stores was brought back to 76 stores as at end of April 2024 compared to 86 a year before, with the aim to bring the total portfolio down to around 50 stores in the future. ----- _Spain_ Our store network continued to expand with 368 stores as of April 30, 2024 compared to 356 stores as at April 30, 2023. Our hearing aid network continued to expand rapidly, mainly through hearing corners, with a total number of points of sales of 152 compared to 117 as at April 30, 2023. Finally, our directlyowned stores perimeter gained one store, accounting for 89 stores as at April 30, 2024. _Other countries_ Other countries grew by eleven stores to 152 as at April 30, 2024 compared to 141 as at April 30, 2023. As at April 30, 2024, we had 55 stores in Belux, 23 stores in Portugal, 22 stores in Morocco, 20 stores in Switzerland, with the remainder including stores in Africa and the Middle East.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

For example, when long-standing franchisees, which are often subject to historical royalty rates that are lower than current rates, retire and are replaced with new franchisees, we are able to obtain more favorable terms. Concerning revenue from franchisees, the new networks such as Acousticien or our new countries of operation (and in the past, our Optical Discount brand) that may have lower royalty rates, impacts our average franchise fees overall. In general, we invoice higher franchise and communication fees in France than in other countries, reflecting our strong brand recognition and considerable know-how. Newer networks such as Acousticien generally incur higher advertising expenditures to foster brand awareness and drive footfall. Additionally, we are progressively extending throughout our network the central listing and payment unit already in place in France and Spain, which covers all of franchisees’ purchases, as well as a central purchasing unit that helps franchisees to optimize the cost of purchases and boost their margins. Moreover, our ability to improve the terms of our agreements with suppliers, primarily attributable to the volume of purchases made within our network, may have an impact on our results. The roll-out of a line of exclusive products, notably through our trading activities can also have an effect on our network sales and revenue. Our ability to improve the penetration rate of these products in the overall purchases of franchisees in our network increases our revenue and profitability. _Directly-owned stores_ Any changes in sales at directly-owned stores impact our revenue, results of operations and financial position. Directly-owned store sales are included in network sales and are also impacted by the factors described above. The contribution of directly-owned stores to our costs and revenue represents a relatively substantial portion of overall costs and revenue, as it mainly corresponds to the costs and sales of these stores directly borne by us. Changes in the number of directly-owned stores therefore affect our cost structure and revenue generation. For example, in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, we bought back two franchisee perimeters accounting for 20 stores and representing €17.0 million of annual sales, in Normandy (January 2022) and in Bordeaux (October 2021). The impact of these additional DOS affected our results of operations in that period compared to the prior one, relating to revenue and cost items. Our strategy for directly-owned stores is based around three major objectives: (i) retaining control over flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies; (ii) having a store network to test new business initiatives and identify best practices in operations and distribution before applying them to the franchisees; and (iii) managing the overall store network when the need arises, through supporting locations where the franchisee is either retiring or experiencing financial difficulties to keep the location within our networks. Setting and achieving these objectives is part of the overall management strategy for the network and involves specific costs, but it contributes to increasing the profitability of the entire franchise activity. Changes in the initiatives or the number of directly-owned stores could therefore impact our future results.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In general, growth in like-for-like network sales is itself influenced by several factors, including: - _Population and lifestyle dynamics. Sales volumes are correlated with population growth and aging. Population growth in the geographical regions in which we operate will likely result in increased demand for optical products. Aging of the population is also expected to result in increased demand for optical products and hearing aids. As a person ages, the need for optical products and hearing aids increases due to age-related far-sightedness and hearing loss. See “Industry”. Evolving social habits and lifestyle patterns, such as growing exposure to digital displays, headphones and noisy environments, as well as increasing eye and hearing health awareness, are also expected to continue to support demand for optical products and hearing aids. Internationally, similar trends in population and lifestyle dynamics are also increasing demand for optical products and hearing aids. - _Technology._ Sales are affected by the availability of technologically innovative products in our product range due to customer demand for the latest technology in optical products. In past decades, there have been significant advances in technology, which have had a positive impact on average basket size. Progressive lenses, photochromatic lenses (i.e., which darken automatically when exposed to sunlight and fade to clear lenses when indoors), polycarbonate lenses (thinner, lighter and more impact-resistant than standard plastic lenses), anti-reflective and anti-scratch lens coatings, break-resistant optical frames (designed with flexible joints and materials that allow a greater degree of bending than conventional frames) and new materials used for contact lenses such as silicon hydrogel are examples of the technologically innovative products sought by customers. Notably, we expect that over time, as the general population ages, the increase in the penetration rate of progressive lenses will lead to an increase in the average basket for optical products. - _Overall economic conditions. As revenue is linked to end customers’ expenditure, the network’s optical product sales have historically been affected by overall macroeconomic conditions and the resulting effects on household consumption, while showing strong resilience as a health-care related expense. These effects may be more significant in countries where the level of reimbursement by insurance systems is low or non-existent, which is the case for most of the markets in which we operate, except France, our largest market. In certain instances, customers have responded to the uncertainty and volatility stemming from macroeconomic conditions by delaying their spending on optical products, rather than simply renouncing to the expense, which explains the longer product renewal cycle observed during challenging economic times. Generally, the renewal cycle for optical products decreases when overall economic conditions start to improve, leading to positive like-for-like network sales growth. Hearing aid product sales are also influenced by prices, as these products were only partially reimbursed in France (although at a lower rate than for optical products) prior to the reforms associated with 100% Santé, and are not reimbursed at all in Spain. - _Regulatory environment. Changes in the regulatory environment impact sales (see “Regulation”). This is especially the case in France, where certain regulatory developments have in the past facilitated access to optical products by reducing administrative barriers to optical prescriptions (see “Regulation”). For a discussion of recent changes in the regulatory environment in France, see “Regulation—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system”. _Fiscal year ended July 31, 2021_ The Group’s like-for-like network sales grew by 20% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. ----- _France_ In France, the network recorded growth of 0.2% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Optical sales benefitted from a strong recovery, with growth of 3.1% in like-for-like sales compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. This recovery was present despite the fact that the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic had a strong impact on the business at the start of calendar year 2021, a period during which approximately 150 of our stores in shopping centers were forced to close from February to May 2021. As a result of having a strong presence in shopping centers, the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater impact on our business compared to independent stores that were not operating in shopping centers and therefore were not forced to close. As a consequence of such closures, ALAIN AFFELOU sales grew by 19.3%, slightly below the estimation of GfK (20.0%) and Observatoire de l’Optique (21.5%), which was attenuated by the expansion of the store count mentioned above. One important aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic was the impact on discretionary sales. Sales of sunglasses and contact lenses were deeply impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, more contact lens wearers shifted to online purchases, and the sunglasses segment was likely affected by the lack of tourists and lower traffic in certain shopping areas, such as large shopping centers. For instance, the market experienced a 7.5% decline in sunglasses sales during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, compared to the same period two years prior. The decline for ALAIN AFFELOU was larger due to its presence in tourist areas and large shopping centers. Our discount banner showed a slightly better performance compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, as the stores base included a lower presence in tourist areas and large shopping centers. Finally, like-for-like sales for the hearing aid network grew by 52.8% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, and 17.3% compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019, at consistent levels with the strong increase of the market, after the launch of the final phase of 100% Santé. _Spain_ Network sales increased by 14.5% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. As was the case in France, sales rebounded strongly since June and July 2020, apart from slowdowns observed during new episodes of restrictive measures. As in France, discretionary sales were affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, our network activity lost 35% of sunglasses sales compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 in line with the market (a decrease of 36.7%). As discretionary sales have a higher weight in Spain than in France, the outcome on the total market is a lower recovery (19.1% for the fiscal year). The market still lagged behind the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019 (negative 2.3% compared to negative 0.4% for our optical sales in Spain). _Other countries_ Network sales in the Other countries segment increased by 22.0% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a recovery in network sales in Belgium and Switzerland. _Fiscal year ended July 31, 2022_ The Group’s network like-for-like sales grew by 0.3% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. _France_ In France, the network sales grew by 0.2% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Sales in the last quarter were impacted by the war in Ukraine and a drop in consumption in all retail activities in France during spring 2022. The comparison on the fiscal year at our historical optical network still showed a positive evolution of 2.7% compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. On the whole, our optical network decreased by 0.1% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, but still outperformed the French market which decreased by 1.0%, as estimated by Xerfi-Observatoire l’optique. More recent trends in France in August and September resulted in positive trends for our ----- Group. Structural factors for our sector, such as unemployment rates and consumption trends remained solid in France, with clear support from the Government, including purchasing power measures initiated during summer 2022. During this period we carefully monitored the evolution of our activity in both optical and hearing aid activities, with a specific focus on traffic and volumes, especially in shopping centers and large traffic areas. We also carefully observed market trends and consumer behavior in our sector so that if there was a deterioration of consumption by our customers we could adequately respond with appropriate commercial offers and products; though sales in our network were positively oriented through the end of September. _Spain_ In Spain, network sales decreased by 0.5% during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Despite a difficult environment with a greater impact on our activity due to a large proportion of discretionary sales in Spain, our performance was almost stable during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. In addition, our historical banner experienced growth compared to the pre-COVID-19 pandemic periods, with a positive evolution of 0.7% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2019. _Other countries_ Network sales in the Other countries segment increased by 3.7% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Our Belgium area recorded a decrease of 1.2% in like-for-like sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022, but still represented high single-digit growth compared to the same period pre-COVID-19. Our Swiss area continued to show a strong performance and grew by 11.6%. In addition to the positive environment in Switzerland and the strong dynamism of our franchisees, locally, our like-for-like sales recorded a technical positive impact linked to the rise of the Swiss franc versus the euro, accounting for approximately 6.0% of the like-for-like total growth. _Fiscal year ended July 31, 2023_ The Group’s network like-for-like sales increased by 4.4% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. _France_ In France, network sales increased by 3.8% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Sales continued to show solid growth, despite the continued decline in our hearing aids business, which impacted the fiscal year in line with trends in the market after rapid volume growth post-2021 following regulatory changes making hearing aids more affordable. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, our optical business recorded like-for-like 5.4% growth compared to 4.0% in the overall market for the same full-year period, as reported by Xerfi-Observatoire l’optique. We believe this growth was due to structural factors, such as: (i) historically low unemployment rates, (ii) strong consumption trends in France, and (iii) a catch-up effect after the COVID-19 pandemic, as many of our customers postponed their glasses purchases (instead of foregoing these purchases altogether). In addition, we believe ALAIN AFFLELOU outperformed the market and improved its commercial performance over the last five fiscal years through a series of initiatives such as Magic clips now suitable for almost all of our exclusive collections and our teleophthalmology innovation which was available in 100 stores as at July 31, 2023. Customer surveys (such as Gallileo’s 2023 survey) continue to show our strong brand awareness, and a positive and improving image of our brand, positioning ourselves on the podium of leading brands in our sector. _Spain_ In Spain, network sales increased by 7.9% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. We believe, as is the case in France, that the optical business benefitted from a catch-up effect after the COVID-19 pandemic, as supported by GfK, reporting a total market growth of 4.1% during the prior fiscal year, despite a difficult environment with a greater impact on our activity due to a large proportion of discretionary sales in Spain. As is the case in France, our historical banner registered ----- strong growth, significantly outperforming the market. In addition, we believe that in Spain we benefitted from the rapid growth of our hearing aids business offering strong synergies with our optical business. _Other countries_ Network sales in the Other countries segment increased by 2.9% on a like-for-like basis during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Our Belgium area recorded a slight growth of 0.8% in like-for-like sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, recovering from a more difficult market environment in the 2022 calendar year. Conversely, our Swiss area slowed down to a total growth of 4.7% in like-for-like sales after a growth of 11.6% in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. In the other countries, we observed continued growth at our Portuguese network, with like-for-like performance of 5.7% throughout the fiscal year, with a combination of positive sector orientation, and the optimization of our network (reflecting a solid balance of directly-owned stores and renewed franchisee partners). _Nine months ended April 30, 2024_ Our like-for-like network sales increased by 3.8% during the nine months ended April 30, 2024. This solid performance was obtained despite lower sales as a result of the Easter holiday, especially in Spain during the month of March. Positive performance of our like-for-like sales gives us confidence for the coming months, as we expect that May and June will benefit from our communication campaign, which started in April and lasted until the beginning of June, covering both of our optical and hearing aid businesses. _France_ Our like-for-like network sales increased by 3.4% during the nine months ended April 30, 2024. This increase was due to the solid performance of our optical business as a result of initiatives such as our _Magic collection and the teleophthalmology solution, and was partly offset by like-for-like sales of our_ hearing aid business which broke even due to the slowdown following the _100% Santé_ regulation settlement in 2021. _Spain_ In Spain, like-for-like network sales increased by 5.7% during the nine months ended April 30, 2024. This was primarily due to like-for-like sales of our hearing aid business increasing by 11.2% as a result of the positive impetus of the optical and hearing aid businesses combination, which was partly offset by a negative performance in March as a result of the Easter holiday. _Other countries_ Like-for-like network sales in our Other countries segment increased by 3.6% during the nine months ended April 30, 2024, primarily due to growth of 6.2% in Belgium and 4.5% in Switzerland. The rest of our Other countries geographical areas were mainly marked by difficulties as a consequence of the political troubles in regions such as the Middle East.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Our management believes that acquisitions enhance the benefits of scale in our industry, particularly with respect to purchasing power, inventory management and logistics as well as general operational synergies. We typically seek synergies from acquisitions relating to the geographical coverage and density of our store network, supplier relationships and product offerings that allow us to expand our ----- offering to both franchisees and end-customers, distribution capabilities (for example, with respect to e-commerce platforms) and general and administrative costs, among others. Following our decision to progressively discontinue our Optical Discount brand, which resulted in a reduction to 22 stores bearing the Optical Discount banner as at July 31, 2023, Optical Discount activities (which we plan to progressively terminate by the end of 2024) are treated as discontinued operations in the audited consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 and our unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended April 30, 2024.

The graph below shows the evolution of our Adjusted EBITDA from the third quarter of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to July 31, 2024: ----- _Source: Company information._ (1) Excluding Optical Discount. (2) Reported Adjusted EBITDA for quarter three of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 (including Optical Discount) was €19.8 million (resulting in a 10.5% margin on network sales including Optical Discount) and reported Adjusted EBITDA for quarter three of the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 (including Optical Discount) was €24.4 million (resulting in a 11.5% margin on network sales including Optical Discount). The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA increased by €6.2 million, or 6.2%, to €106.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 (compared to €100.7 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021). This increase is mainly linked to the growth of our network activity in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year. Growing synergies with the hearing aids business, economies of scale at our optical franchise business in mature areas, and finally, a positive evolution at our DOS structure, also allowed our profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA to significantly offset the slight decline of network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA increased by €7.5 million, or 7.0%, to €114.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023 (compared to €106.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022). The increase was linked to network sales growth. Apart from our hearing aids business and directly-owned stores in France, all of our stores generated a growth in Adjusted EBITDA, replicating the strong dynamism of our network sales. ----- Adjusted EBITDA increased by €3.2 million, from €83.0 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2023 to €86.1 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, which was driven by strong sales at our historical banner in most geographical areas compared to the prior comparable period. Following our communication campaign which started in April, our communication revenues started to catch up from the prior quarters but still lagged behind as at the end of April 30, 2024. _France_ Adjusted EBITDA generated in France increased by €6.9 million, or 8.5%, from €81.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to €87.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The growth in our profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA in France was also partly linked to the strong evolution of our directly-owned structure, benefitting from sound performances of the two perimeters acquired during the prior fiscal year. While the franchisor performance was attenuated in the last quarter by the decline of 3.0% in network sales, our franchise business reported a satisfactory performance on the full year due to the overall network sales evolution of a 1.4% increase, together with well-managed operating costs, economies of scale in the optical business, and an improvement of our profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA in the hearing aids business at almost 5.0% of network sales. On the whole, our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of network sales in France reached a peak at 13.2% compared to 12.3%, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021. Adjusted EBITDA generated in France increased by €4.7 million or 5.3%, from €87.9 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 to €92.6 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The growth in profitability in France as measured by Adjusted EBITDA was aligned with our growth in network sales by 5.0% across the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA at our optical business benefitted from economies of scale, while our hearing aid business was impacted by the continued slowdown of the whole sector after its dramatic growth in 2021 following the implementation of _100% Santé. Our directly-owned stores also showed a decline in profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA due to the inflation slightly impacting our gross margin and our personnel costs. As aforementioned, we have started to restructure and reduce our directly-owned stores portfolio, with an organization giving more autonomy to store managers with a lighter headquarters structure, in accordance with the aim of enabling them to become franchisees. Adjusted EBITDA generated in France represented €70.5 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2024, compared to €67.9 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2023. Our Adjusted EBITDA benefitted from the strong network activity at our historical optical banner and the catch-up of our revenue generated from communication campaigns that started in April. The profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA of our French optical network stands at record high levels benefitting from economies of scale while continuing to expand regularly. On the other hand, our profitability growth as measured by Adjusted EBITDA was attenuated by a decline at our directly-owned stores, linked to a lower performance of existing stores and the continued reduction of its perimeter. Finally, our hearing aid business reported an improvement of its profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA following the recovery of the network sales growth in recent months. _Spain_ Adjusted EBITDA generated in Spain decreased by €0.8 million, or 4.9%, from €16.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to €15.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. The decrease is linked to the loss of €1.1 million at our hearing aid business, which mainly consisted of communication campaigns to relaunch this activity locally. In Spain, on the whole and on a full-year basis, our Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of network sales stood at 12.1%, very close to the level of 13.2% in France. Adjusted EBITDA generated in Spain increased by €2.3 million, or 14.8%, from €15.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 to €17.8 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The increase tracked the strength of our network performance, while we recorded lower losses at our hearing aid business than the prior year (losses were reduced by €0.4 million, following the ramp-up of our network, ----- which reached €7.8 million of sales during the fiscal year, compared to €4.0 million a year before). As a consequence, our profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA in Spain continued to grow, reaching 12.6% of network sales on a full-year basis, at a level close to France, which stood at 13.9% over the same period. Adjusted EBITDA generated in Spain increased by €0.7 million from €12.4 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2023, compared to €13.1 million for the nine months ended April 30, 2024. This increase is primarily due to the strong performance of the optical business. On the other side, our directly-owned stores perimeter reported a decline in profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA resulting from a slight decline in our gross margin as a percentage of sales, and higher external charges and personnel costs, in a context of stagnating sales in recent months. Finally, the continued rise of our hearing aid activity resulted in a significant growth of its profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA with a gain of €0.4 million in the nine months ended April 30, 2024, compared to the prior year, allowing us to almost break even. _Other countries_ Adjusted EBITDA generated in the Other countries segment increased by €0.1 million, from €3.4 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021 to €3.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022. Belgium accounted for close to half of our profitability, as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, at 5.8% of network sales, for the fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA generated in the Other countries segment increased by €0.5 million, from €3.5 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022 to €4.0 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Belgium and Switzerland continued to represent a large part of our profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA in this area, with a mature network in the French-speaking regions of those countries. Adjusted EBITDA generated in the Other Countries segment decreased to €2.5 million during the nine months ended April 30, 2024, compared to €2.6 million during the nine months ended April 30, 2023. The slight decline in profitability as measured by Adjusted EBITDA of this geographical segment is mainly linked to the aforementioned schedule of our communications campaign, with a catch-up starting in April.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Also, our directly-owned stores recorded good performances in the prior fiscal year due to a rebound compared to the prior year, when a number of those stores were impacted by restriction measures in shopping centers.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.45,Liquidity and capital resources,17.45.1,,"Historically, our liquidity requirements have arisen primarily from the need to service our indebtedness, finance working capital and fund the expansion of our store network, finance acquisitions and pay taxes. Our sources of liquidity and capital have historically consisted mainly of the following: - issuances of senior and senior subordinated debt consisting of prior issuances of high-yield notes and borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facility; - shareholder injections in the form of shareholder bonds, which refer to the shareholder convertible bonds that were previously issued by the Issuer and held by certain shareholders. - certain other bilateral credit facilities permitted sale of discounted receivables from franchisees (cessions Dailly), finance leases and factoring of CIR-related receivables; and - cash generated from operating activities. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and the Existing Revolving Credit Facility. The majority of our indebtedness is represented by the Existing Notes. We continue to marginally access certain uncommitted short-term discount lines (assignment of trade receivables), overdrafts and medium-term bilateral loans, factoring programs and financial leases as business needs dictate, in particular for store renovations (mainly for directly-owned stores) and key money expense. Following the Offering, our principal sources of liquidity will be cash flow from operating activities and the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Group’s franchise/asset-light model generates strong levels of operating cash flows, with only limited working capital and capital expenditure requirements. The majority of our indebtedness will be represented by the Notes offered hereby. Additionally, we will continue to access certain uncommitted short-term discount lines (assignment of trade receivables), overdrafts, medium-term bilateral loans and financial leases as business needs dictate, in particular for store renovations (mainly for directly-owned stores) and key money. Finally, the Group will maintain a network of directly-owned stores and will consequently have lease arrangements on its owned stores and certain administrative premises, representing total right-of-use assets under IFRS 16 of €72.2 million, and lease debt (net of sublease arrangements) of €82.1 million as of April 30, 2024. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness and Other Arrangements”. The sources of our working capital requirements include: - requirements relating to sales of goods in our wholesale activity with our networks. In connection with our exclusive frames trading business and central purchasing unit sales, we recognize significant trade receivables in relation to our franchisees, as well as in relation to our partners distributing the exclusive frames. Furthermore, optical sales to end-consumers via directly-owned stores in France generate customer credit for an estimated period of between 15 days and one month following the sale, due to the third-party payment system that is used in the French optical sector (tiers payant); - inventories, mainly in directly-owned stores. Inventories may vary depending on the arrival of new collections, particularly with regard to sunglasses. We also store products to be sold to franchisees as part of the rollout of new collections; and ----- - requirements generated by central listing and payment unit arrangements, whereby we pay suppliers on behalf of franchisees. Such mechanisms normally generate a time lag of 15 days to one month between payment to suppliers and payment by franchisees in respect of the goods concerned. In addition, in the event of late payments, we sometimes grant franchised stores more flexible payment deadlines, which further increases working capital requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The main factor is the complete reimbursement of the support provided to our franchisees during the confinement period for a total amount of €25.5 million during the fiscal year, along with the continued improvement of receivables of our franchisees over the last several years. Also, our inventories were reduced by €5.3 million, mostly at our trading activity, part of which was due to the phasing of our new collections, which were slightly delayed and thus did not weigh on our total inventories, at the end of the fiscal year.

Typically prescribed by ophthalmologists, optometrists, orthoptist or opticians (depending on countries), following eye tests, Prescription Optical Products fall within the reimbursement scope of public healthcare systems or private insurance (see “Industry—Market Drivers”). In France, historically, only ophthalmologists were authorized to perform eye tests and issue prescriptions with a three to five-year validity period depending on ages (three years for people older than 42 years and five years for people between 16 and 42). As part of the _100% Santé regulation applicable as of January 2021 (described below under “Market Drivers”), which amongst other measures was intended to address shortages of ophthalmologists, opticians now have the ability to perform eye tests and adapt, if necessary, ophthalmologist prescriptions. We believe this regulation supports sales of Prescription Optical Products in France. In Spain, opticians and optometrists are able to perform eye tests and write prescriptions, including through teleconsultations which, combined with the shortage of ophthalmologists (similarly to France), creates opportunities for opticians. For further information concerning the regulations governing the optical products and hearing aid market in France and Spain, see “Regulation—France—Regulations governing the optical products and hearing _aid _markets in France” and “Regulation—Spain—Regulations governing the optical products and hearing aid markets in Spain”._ Functionality, comfort and aesthetics are the key factors influencing a customer’s decision when selecting Prescription Optical Products. ----- _Source: Company Information (analysis above limited to France). Optical Lenses_ Optical lenses (also called “corrective lenses”) fall into two main categories of products: (i) _unifocal _lenses (single vision lenses) and (ii) multifocal lenses addressing several correction regions (including,_ for instance, bifocals or progressive lenses). The market for corrective lenses has grown and developed considerably over the years, fueled by the emergence of technologies such as digital surfacing (allowing to produce tailor-made lenses, including more technically demanding progressive lenses). Essilor-Luxottica, Carl Zeiss Vision and Hoya are the leading suppliers of corrective lenses. _Frames_ Frames are available in wide ranges of materials, styles and brands. They are usually adapted to suit wearers and may feature useful add-ons such as flexible spring hinges. Many customers consider glasses to be fashion accessories in addition to their functional purpose. Aesthetics and brand name are therefore considered key decision factors when customers make the decision to purchase frames. The market for frame manufacturing, which consists of a large number of medium-sized players, is highly fragmented and competitive. However, a few groups including EssilorLuxottica, Safilo Kering-Eyewear (part of Kering Group), Thélios (part of LVMH) and Marcolin are considered the leaders in this market, in particular for luxury brands. _Contact Lenses and Care Solutions_ Contact lenses can be unifocal or multifocal (i.e., similar to corrective lenses). Further, contact lenses can be soft, rigid or hybrid. Rigid contact lenses are generally more expensive than soft contact lenses (with up to single usage, or daily use) because they may be used for long periods without replacement. Contact lenses also require certain care products, such as daily or weekly cleaning solutions. ----- Contact lenses present customers with an alternative to wearing glasses. Consequently, customers who wear contact lenses typically also own at least one pair of glasses to regularly or occasionally replace their contact lenses. Contact lenses are typically sold, not only in brick and mortar opticians, but also through e-commerce and pharmacies (as these products can automatically be renewed without necessarily being seen before by an optician). See “Competitive Landscape”. The market for the manufacturing of contact lenses is led by three U.S. manufacturers (Johnson & Johnson, Bausch & Lomb and Coopervision) and one Swiss manufacturer (Alcon-Ciba).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Healthcare-related hearing aid products benefit from significant reimbursement and regulatory backing in France (but limited in Spain). In 2023, the market in France had a value of €2.0 billion and the market in Spain had a value of €0.6 billion (according to Xerfi and Sra.Modne) with particularly strong tailwinds and growing penetration of hearing aids products, following introduction of the _100% Santé_ regulation in France (see “Market _Development”)._ The size of the addressable population for hearing aid products remains smaller compared to optical products. The population with hearing impairment is estimated to be approximately 10.0% in France and Spain (according to EuroTrak) compared to an estimated 68.0% to 79.0% for vision impairment in France (according to Xerfi). Significant untapped potential remains, however, in a market characterized by lower penetration rates (approximately 39.0% to 46.0% of the self-declared hearing impaired population in Spain and France; according to EuroTrak) in comparison to optical products. While the fundamental components of hearing aids are the same, the specific components used across different hearing aids can vary significantly. The cost of a high-end hearing aid can be many times the price of a low-end hearing aid. Such cost differences are generally driven by the device’s software, components and functionality. Hearing aid manufacturers are highly concentrated, with the top six hearing aid manufacturers accounting for approximately 90.0% of the market (Sivantos (Siemens)/Widex, Sonova, William Demant, GN Resound, and Starkey).

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Market Drivers,18.2.1,Demographics,"One of the main drivers of market growth is the growing prevalence of hearing and vision conditions, directly linked to structurally ageing (older segments of the population register higher rates of visual anomalies) and growing populations, along with evolving lifestyles. In terms of ageing, hearing and vision begin to deteriorate progressively from ages 40 to 45 with more serious impairments, such as presbycusis (hearing) or presbyopia (vision), becoming more common and irreversible with ageing. This is evidenced by the higher penetration rate of optical products amongst older age groups (94.0% to 97.0% for the French population aged 65 and older have vision impairments compared to 33.0% to 52.0% for the French population aged between 15 and 24) with a similar pattern for hearing aid products (approximately 33.0% of the French population aged 74 and older have hearing loss compared to approximately 3.0% for the French population aged between 15 and 24 according to DREES and Xerfi). As such, as the population ages and the population aged 45 and older in France and Spain becomes more numerous, the addressable market is expected to grow both in terms of volume and prices, with the latter reflecting the increasing need of older people for more expensive vision or hearing solutions, such as progressive lenses that are twice as expensive than simpler unifocals. Moreover, continuous demographic growth in France and Spain combined with evolving lifestyle choices, such as increasing screen time or extensive use of headphones, support a higher prevalence of vision and hearing impairments even at younger ages, as indicated by the below graphs. _Sources: Xerfi and DREES._ ----- _Source: EuroTrak France 2022._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

For hearing aids, social drivers include (i) increased social acceptance of these products (absence of stigmatization) and (ii) urbanization and noise pollution. For optical products, social drivers include higher levels of (i) people attending schools and universities, (ii) skilled and technical jobs, (iii) use of computers and similar devices (including uptake on blue-light blocking technology), (iv) awareness of eye protection from sun exposure, (v) demand for multiple glasses and (vi) focus on health and wellness (i.e. need to maintain good eyesight).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Market Drivers,18.2.4,Reimbursement Framework and Regulation,"Regulations and reimbursement frameworks have been highly contributive to generating higher demand for our products however at varying levels depending on countries with a relatively better framework in France compared to Spain. _Optical Products_ Reimbursement Frameworks In France, Prescription Optical Products benefit from high reimbursement levels through both a public (“French Social Security”) and private (“OCAMs”) healthcare insurance mix and so these products have limited out-of-pocket costs for customers, supporting a very resilient market by nature. Since the implementation of the Accord National Interprofessionnel (“ANI”), requiring companies to offer complementary and private insurance to employees (offering more generous reimbursements), average ----- out-of-pocket costs have decreased to approximately 23.0% in 2019 compared to approximately 36.0% in 2009 (according to Advancy). Remaining costs are typically covered by French Social Security for (up to approximately 5.0%) and by complementary private healthcare insurance (OCAM) (up to approximately 73.0%). With the 100% Santé reform, we believe that the average out-of-pocket costs for end-customers will continue to stand at a limited proportion of the total expense, including the requirement to opticians to offer a minimum number of so-called “Class A” products that are capped at a specific price to allow no out-of-pocket costs for end-customers. Following the 100% Santé reform, opticians are now required to offer a minimum of 35 frame models for adults, and 20 frame models for children, at €30.0 or less, with lenses ranging between €32.50 and €170.0. More expensive products, so-called “Class B”, products bear no constraints and allow customers more freedom of choice albeit limiting frame reimbursements, which are capped at €100 compared to €150 before the reform. Approximately 16.0% of glasses sold, fall within the 100% Santé framework. In contrast, Spain is characterized by relatively low coverage of optical costs by the public health system, low enrollment in private insurance and, more generally speaking, a regulatory framework that is not as supportive as in France (for instance no requirement for employers to offer complementary health insurance). Regulation In general, markets where we operate are subject to various types of regulations on the ability to (i) carry out eye tests and write prescriptions, (ii) distribute products (such as the regulation of online tests) or (iii) communicate / market / advertise (restrictions on advertising from health professionals, including opticians). However, regulations on these aspects are becoming more liberal and, if such trends continue, notably on the easing on eye testing restrictions in France (see “Industry—Optical Products Markets”), the market is expected to become increasingly more accessible and therefore beneficial to opticians. _Hearing Aids_ Reimbursement frameworks Given high average prices for hearing aids ranging from less than €1,000 to more than €2,000 according to Arcane, customers’ out-of-pocket expenses have been comparatively higher versus optical products. In France, where device reimbursement is driven by a public and private mix (similar to optical products), out-of-pocket expenses were approximately 50.0% on average in 2019, before the introduction of 100% _Santé regulation, according to Arcane._ The recent changes brought by 100% Santé, which increased reimbursement of hearing aid products up to €950, significantly helped decrease out-of-pocket expenses for customers to an estimated 35% as of 2023 according to Arcane. The reform has since supported strong demand from customers previously deterred from hearing aid products due to their relative high costs – see “—Market _Development”. Between 36.0% and 38.0% of hearing aid equipment sold, fall within the 100% Santé_ framework. In Spain, the reimbursement of hearing aids is more limited as public health insurance does not reimburse these costs and enrollment in complementary health insurance plans is rather low. In countries such as Spain where reimbursement rates are low, the affordability of hearing aids is ----- particularly sensitive (most of the cost being borne by customers), which explains a relatively low penetration rate (in 2022, 46.0% of self-declared hearing impaired population in France with hearing aids compared to 39.0% in Spain according to EuroTrak). According to Arcane, the average price of hearing aids has been stable since 2016, ranging from €1,565 in 2016 to €1,557 in 2023. This stability is partly explained by the change in product mix sold resulting from the 100% Santé reform, with a greater proportion of entry level equipment being sold. Regulation Similarly to Optical Products, the Hearing Aid market is highly regulated, including with respect to the ability to carry out tests, write prescriptions and distribute and promote products. In general, the adoption of hearing aid products is rising as regulatory barriers are decreasing, principally driven by (i) decreasing costs (i.e., improving reimbursement frameworks with the ability to buy equipment with zero out-of-pocket costs in France following the 100% Santé reform in France) and (ii) the liberalization of hiring professionals (the numerus clausus for ENT specialists increased by over 50.0% between 2015 and 2021 in France according to Advancy and more responsibility has been given to mid-level health professions such as nurses, technicians, audiologists, pharmacists, etc.).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Market Drivers,18.2.5,Technological Advances,"The market for optical and hearing products has grown alongside technological innovations, with different dynamics across optical and hearing products. On optical products, technological advances have primarily taken the form of “add-on” supplements (such as multifocal or polarized lenses or blue-light blocking coatings), which favor continuous average selling price increases. In contrast, in hearing, innovations have favored downward pricing pressure by promoting affordability (to penetrate markets) alongside more discreet, comfortable or functional products. Key innovations on optical products include, amongst others, (i) polycarbonate lenses (thinner, lighter and more impact-resistant compared to standard plastic lenses), (ii) break-resistant frames, which allow a greater degree of bending compared to conventional frames, (iii) new materials (i.e., silicon hydrogel) and (iv) general innovations for lenses (progressive, anti-reflective, shock-proof, light-adaptive lenses, scratch-resistant, polarized, ultraviolet-protective or blue-light blocking). In hearing, step improvements in microphone or microchip technologies have led to the introduction of miniature hearing aids, which are virtually invisible, easy to insert and remove and offer better hearing correction.

As evidenced by the COVID-19 crisis in 2020, with markets more than recovering the following year, optical products have proven to be resilient and insulated from GDP swings (especially in France where reimbursement frameworks are more favorable) with approximately 86.0% and 94.0% of the market mix in Spain and France being non-discretionary and healthcare-related as shown in the graphs below, given customers generally tend not to defer vision correction once impairment is diagnosed. _Source: GfK._ In terms of average selling price and volume mix, the market has been characterized by rather flat average selling price growth and strong volume increases. A number of trends have exerted downward pressure on average selling price, including (i) promotions and rebates, (ii) an increase in low-price products (marketed by large retailers), (iii) the rise of closed networks or so called mutualists (see “— Competitive Landscape”)_ with preferred tariffs and (iv) regulatory changes (notably in France with 100% _Santé), which were largely compensated by positive product mix evolution, notably through_ technological advances, driving average selling prices higher (multifocal products exhibiting higher average selling prices have been outgrowing other product groups). In terms of volumes, the market ----- observed a strong acceleration of demand tied primarily to demographic vectors and new regulations (notably in France with 100% Santé).

The 100% Santé effect was largely volume driven (85.0% growth in volume of devices sold over 2020 and 2021) as average prices were lowered (20.0% decrease in price over 2020 and 2021), also reflecting the sizeable demand historically contained by the high prices of hearing aid devices, as shown in the graph below (according to Xerfi and DREES). The health authorities have taken significant measures, not only by substantially increasing coverage of expenses (with Social Security greatly increasing reimbursements, far surpassing those in optics) but also through their 100% _Santé communication campaign. This effort addresses public health concerns related to hearing loss_ and promotes the entirely free offer available to the public. _Sources: Xerfi, DREES « Comptes de la santé 2022 »._ Further, in addition to the _100% Santé impact, the hearing aid market is, similar to optical products, underpinned by resilient drivers and stable growth in line with the non-discretionary, healthcare-related nature of the product.

A limited number of players compete on a national or regional scale, some of which use new business models (named “challengers”, such as pure online players or low-cost chains). Few, however, benefit from a transnational scale like ALAIN AFFLELOU which is a market player in different geographies. _Source: Xerfi._ The market is segmented between (i) retail optical chains, (ii) marketing groups, (iii) independent retailers and members of buying groups and, in France, (iv) mutualists (mutuelles): _Retail chains include groups of five or more stores with an operating model based on a franchise model,_ a fully-owned model (i.e. “integrated networks”) or a combination of both. ALAIN AFFLELOU falls in this ----- category (see “Business”) amongst peers like GrandVision in France (operating the Grand Optical, Générale d’Optique and Solaris banners in France). _Marketing groups (also referred as “cooperatives”) regroup independent opticians under a single_ banner. They started with a goal to pool resources, especially for their purchases, and progressively shared more services (such as marketing), while keeping a significant level of autonomy, compared to franchise businesses. Store owners pay a contribution fee in order to benefit from pooled resources and services, with each owning equity capital and involved in the decision-making process of the group. Marketing groups refer to brands like Optic 2000, Krys and Atol in France. _Independent retailers (or members of buying groups) operate their own stores and brands, bearing all_ related risks. These independent owners may join buying groups to benefit from better purchasing conditions, but generally do not benefit from collective benefits of retail chains or marketing groups. Mutualists consist of insurance-owned or related groups, a model only existing in France. In the past, people with certain insurance policies (e.g. school teachers) could buy optical products at a muchreduced price, fully reimbursed by health insurance companies, paving the way for nation-wide chains such as Les Opticiens Mutualistes (recently renamed Ecouter Voir). Following a regulatory change in 2014, these groups no longer benefit from a protective statute and fully operate like other retail chains open to every customer, although still linked to insurance companies with preferred tariffs and prices for members. In addition, so-called challengers are progressively emerging with pharmacist groups and new players, usually start-ups, based on digital-only models (especially for products like contact lenses that are automatically renewed without the need to see or test products) or disruptive retail models (faster processing times, price competitiveness, specific clientele targeted, etc.). In the latter case, a number of these disruptive players are actively owned by historical groups (for instance ALAIN AFFLELOU owns Malentille.com, a digital-only company). _Market Share_ The Spanish and French markets for optical products are fragmented in value, with main participants in each market accounting for a maximum of 13.0% (France) and 19.0% (Spain) of market share (according to Xerfi). Independent retailers have especially experienced the steepest market share losses in recent years 3.0% market share decline since 2015 in France (according to Advancy) due to increasing competitive pressure from optical groups in a market generally trending towards more consolidation and verticalization (i.e., integration of some suppliers such as with the acquisition by Essilor-Luxottica of GrandVision). As this trend continues, competitive advantages from larger distributors like ALAIN AFFLELOU are expected to continue to grow on the back of greater purchasing power, better talent management and economies of scale while independent players in particular – representing the largest share of stores but a limited market share in value – are expected to continue to be absorbed. As of 2023, ALAIN AFFLELOU was the largest retail chain group and third largest optical group in France with a 9% market share, behind Optic 2000 (12% market share), Krys (13% market share) (according to Xerfi).

While there are many regional and national players, only a handful have a multi-country approach like ALAIN AFFLELOU. Dual activity (i.e. hearing and optical) amongst optical groups has been spreading and accelerating since 2019 with an increasing number of optical groups integrating audio corners into their networks with the implementation of the 100% Santé reform in France; however, the development of those have lagged frontrunners like ALAIN AFFLELOU, Krys, Acuitis and Optic 2000 who have seized the full benefit / market uptick earlier than the implementation of this reform, having started a dual activity early on.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.5,BUSINESS Overview,18.5.1,,"Founded by Mr. Alain Afflelou in Bordeaux in 1972, we are a leading optical product and hearing aid franchisor in Europe. We operate the largest French optical product franchise network in terms of both revenue and number of stores in France. ALAIN AFFLELOU is the third-largest optical business overall, with a 9.0% market share in 2023 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) in a fragmented market that has historically included many independent retailers (according to Xerfi). In addition to our historical French market, we have a large and well-developed network in Spain, our second core domestic market, where we had 368 stores as of April 30, 2024. We operated the largest optical product franchise network in Spain (in terms of number of stores) and were the fifth largest optical retail chain, with a 7.0% market share in 2023 (in terms of revenue, including VAT and excluding online sales) (according to Xerfi). As of July 31, 2023, France, Spain and Other countries, our three geographic segments, represented 64.0%, 26.0% and 10.0%, respectively, of our total number of stores. The retail sale of optical products and hearing aids represented 92.8% and 7.2%, respectively, of our network sales for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. Building on our significant market share in our core geographic markets, France and Spain, we have grown our ALAIN AFFLELOU total store count to 1,434 stores as of April 30, 2024 compared to 1,397 as of April 30, 2023. In the past eleven years, we have grown our market share and maintained a leadership position in our key markets. Our growth is in part the result of market growth at a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 2.7% and 2.4% in France and Spain, respectively, from calendar years 2019 to 2023 (according to GfK), as well as the performance of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand itself. Our intensive and long-term marketing and advertising efforts and campaigns (including our partnerships with key brand ambassadors) have also contributed to the success and power of our brand. In our two main secondary markets, Belgium and Switzerland, network sales for ALAIN AFFLELOU grew at a CAGR of 2.0% and 8.7%, respectively, from calendar years 2019 to 2023. We have been strategically adapting our store perimeter in recent years to increase profitability. We rely on our strong brand and large network of franchisees. Each additional store that we open allows us to benefit from economies of scale by spreading our fixed costs over a broader base of stores and sales potential. Such fixed costs include mainly the support costs of the network management, personnel costs and, among other things, administrative fees and structural costs, warehousing and inventory management costs, as well advertising and marketing costs relating to the promotion of our brand (which we believe will in turn benefit a larger number of stores and generate a greater volume of sales). The essential, health-care nature of our products makes them largely non-discretionary purchases that may, at best, be sometimes delayed. We estimate that approximately 96.0% of our products are purchased by our customers as a result of a prescription or a medical need, namely: prescription glasses (82.0%), hearing aids (8.0%), contact lenses (6.0%). For example, at ALAIN AFFLELOU in France and Spain under both optical and hearing aids, for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, 95.7% of network sales were generated by sales of glasses or hearing aids that are generally purchased with a prescription. According to 2024 data from Gallileo, 85.0% of customers indicated their reason for purchasing new glasses was the result of a medical need compared to 15.0% who indicated it was based on personal, non-health-related preferences. These dynamics create resilience and predictability in our sales as customers replace prescription products in regular and fairly short intervals (especially in countries where we benefit from a favorable regulatory framework whereby the majority of prescription products are reimbursed by social security and healthcare insurance providers, as is the case in France, our main market). In addition, these factors drive stable replacement cycles. For example, in France, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 2.8 years, which replacement cycle remained stable for the last ten years according to a report prepared by Advancy in 2022. In Spain, the average replacement cycle from 2015 to 2021 was estimated to be 4.2 years, according to the same report. The rest of our sales result from discretionary purchases, such as sunglasses and optical and hearing aid accessories. Even in times of economic difficulty or pandemics, customers continue to buy and order glasses while our stores (which are classified as “essential” businesses, reflecting the healthcare-nature of the products we sell) remain open. Alternatively, ----- customers may defer their purchase for only a short period of time. As a demonstration of this effect, after COVID-19 confinement periods, we observed a rebound in sales, which generally outperformed the same period in prior years, as customers caught up on overdue purchases for prescription glasses, lenses and hearing aids. We operate in highly attractive markets that are differentiated from traditional retail markets due to the largely non-discretionary and healthcare-related nature of optical and hearing aid expenses and a supportive healthcare reimbursement system in France. We believe that both the optical product and hearing aid markets are supported by positive structural drivers, including demographic trends, changing lifestyles, technological innovations, product penetration dynamics and value-adding product add-ons. In addition, our signature products are a key value differentiator, generating customer interest and good margins for us and our franchisees. The success of our franchisee-centered business model is demonstrated by the over-performance of our franchisees compared to the wider market: average revenue per store for ALAIN AFFLELOU in France for the 2021 calendar year was €0.9 million (including VAT), which is approximately 1.5 times the retail market average (and approximately 3.3 times the independent and smaller marketing group retailer store in 2021), and our average revenue per store in Spain for the calendar year ended 2019 was €0.4 million, which was approximately 2.1 times the retail market average in that year (and approximately 4.8 times the independent and smaller market group retailer store average in 2019), demonstrating the added value we offer to current and potential franchisees. Our strategy is based on strong branding, exclusive products, multi-possession, payment solutions and positive customer experience, and a multi-offer approach that reaches a variety of price points and target customers. ALAIN AFFLELOU offers a wide range of optical and hearing aid products, including our exclusive products, which consist of (i) signature label frames and sunglasses bearing the “Afflelou” signature; (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses; and (iii) other exclusive brands and third-party names. We connect with and understand consumers in our markets through our communications and marketing efforts, which have created a powerful and enduring brand image, as evidenced by our high brand awareness with customers in our main markets. Among optical retailers, we ranked first in terms of spontaneous and assisted awareness in France, second in terms of spontaneous awareness in Spain and first in assisted awareness in Wallonia (Belgium) and ranked second in assisted brand awareness among hearing aid retailers, according to various market studies conducted in 2018 and 2019. We also connect with consumers via our online presence. We began developing our online presence in 2012 and have progressively been incorporating our online initiatives under a unified digital umbrella. Currently we maintain websites in the languages of the principal countries where we operate. Additionally, in September 2016, we acquired two online pure players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com. We have incorporated the activities of Happyview.fr into our French Afflelou website. Malentille.com continues to serve customers on its own platform with back-end integration with the Group’s online activities. Our principal activity is to act as a franchisor, licensing the use of our brand to franchisees and providing them with the right to trade under our brand and implement our value proposition through our commercial offers. Our directly-owned stores support our principal franchisor activity by (i) serving as flagship locations in and around Paris and other key strategic locations and large urban areas; (ii) helping to test new concepts; (iii) facilitating store network management; and (iv) generating high purchase volumes, which facilitates our negotiations with suppliers. Our services as a franchisor are aimed at helping franchisees grow their sales by fostering a strong brand image, driving customers to our stores through the design and promotion of our commercial offers and facilitating franchisee operations via a number of support services. Our scale and expertise yield tangible benefits to our franchisees, allowing us to offer (i) commercial support and innovation through new commercial offers and through high-impact national and local communication campaigns that ----- create high brand awareness; (ii) access to central listing and purchasing unit services that lower costs for our franchisees; (iii) dedicated services that enhance store attractiveness, including assistance with location selection and store design; (iv) training programs designed to enhance sales performance; and (v) other general support functions, including legal, human resources and recruiting assistance, as well as assistance with joining care networks in France. Our franchise model also offers tangible benefits to our suppliers by giving them access to our global network of stores. We also provide suppliers with distribution services, including a central listing and payment unit that allows suppliers to list and offer their products to our franchisees, while offering the benefit of having a single counterparty for commercial negotiations and payments. We also support suppliers by actively promoting their innovative products to our franchisees, as well as through sales in our directly-owned stores. Our franchise model combines: (i) revenue based on network sales of our franchisees (27.4% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023), (ii) revenue based on purchases (42.2% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023) and (iii) revenue generated by sales to end-customers in our directly-owned stores and through our websites (30.4% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023). Revenue based on network sales includes in particular: entry fees, franchise fees and communication fees, as well as other fees charged for services that we provide to our franchisees. Revenue based on purchases includes in particular: trading as well as central listing and payment unit (which are charged to our listed suppliers) and licensing fees and revenue from sales of our exclusive products. Revenue generated by our directly-owned stores mainly includes sales made directly to endcustomers in those directly-owned stores, as well as through our websites. This model not only provides us with revenue diversification but also increases our Adjusted EBITDA by increasing our network sales at limited fixed costs when opening new franchisee stores. This results in greater economies of scale and improved operating leverage and profitability. Our main costs are related to the supply and production of products that we sell under our own brands or for which we have a license. For our exclusive frames, Okia, a company based in China, has long been our favored intermediary. Okia is not a manufacturer but sources its products from a network of independent factories in Asia and allows the Group to benefit from optimal production conditions through this unique commercial relationship.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Our business,18.6.1,Franchise model,"_Overview_ Our franchisees are independent entrepreneurs who have entered into franchise agreements with us to operate one or several optical and/or hearing aid points of sale. By partnering with us, our franchisees gain access to our proven franchise model, providing them with (i) greater access to customers through increased brand awareness, our marketing and communication strategy and attractive and affordable offers, (ii) access to our exclusive Afflelou-branded products, (iii) negotiated terms with a large number of listed suppliers in our central listing structure, and additional negotiated terms with certain listed suppliers through our central purchasing unit and (iv) support services throughout the lifecycle of the franchise, including store design and merchandising, financing and sales force support and recruiting. _Our franchise agreements_ The terms and conditions of our franchise agreements define the reciprocal roles and obligations of us and our franchisees and reflect the particular requirements of each of our brands, which are generally comparable across our network, as well as the different jurisdictions in which we operate. Likewise, levels of remuneration paid to us from franchisees vary from country to country. Franchise agreements in our network generally have an initial three-year term and are automatically renewed two years in advance for an additional one-year period, unless the contract is terminated during its initial period or during each such additional period, for a maximum period of ten years. As a result of the renewal conditions of our franchise agreements, we generally have visibility of approximately two years on the evolution of our franchise partnerships. Franchisees are granted exclusivity in a certain territory with respect to where they are operating, and in return, they are subject to standard non-compete provisions. In order to protect the integrity of the ALAIN AFFLELOU network, we only operate with franchisees who are exclusively involved in the optical and hearing aid businesses in our network (other than limited arrangements with certain independent stores). In addition, franchisees are generally prohibited from carrying out a franchise activity with any other group or franchise or distribution network during a period of one year from the date of the end of the franchise agreement. We receive a one-time entry fee per store. Additionally, pursuant to our standard franchise agreement, franchisees pay a monthly standard franchise fee of 4.15% of their network sales (excluding VAT) in France and 4.23% of their network sales (excluding VAT) in Spain. The royalty fee is our fee for the award of a non-exclusive license to use our brand and trademarks according to the terms of the franchise agreement, as well as the provision of various other franchisor services, in particular the know-how that we provide to the franchisee during the course of the agreement. See “—Services that _we provide as franchisor” for a description of the services we provide to franchisees._ Additionally, as franchisor, we provide communications and marketing services as further described under “—Advertising and communications to build strong brand awareness”, for which the franchisees compensate us. For European franchisees, the communications budget for each country is presented by management and approved at the annual meeting of the relevant CNF (as defined in “—Franchisee _representation”) and is generally the same proportion of sales for any franchisee with no negotiation_ except for franchisees outside of metropolitan areas. For non-European franchisees, the compensation for these services is set in the franchise agreement and varies in amount depending on the market and our local communications strategy. For example, communication fees are currently set at 8.76% of a franchisee’s network sales for the ALAIN AFFLELOU optical business in France (excluding VAT) and ----- 8.34% of a franchisee’s network sales for the ALAIN AFFLELOU optical business in Spain (excluding VAT). We may terminate a franchise agreement in a number of circumstances, in particular in cases of a material failure by the franchisee to observe our commercial policy or where a franchisee closes its store or is unable to maintain or renew the relevant lease, fails to make payments required under the agreement or becomes insolvent. Additionally, we may terminate the contract upon the death or incapacity of the franchisee or the loss of his or her license as an optician or audio prosthetist (as applicable), or in certain other events, including the violation of the non-compete provision. The franchisee may also terminate a franchise agreement without cause at the end of the initial three-year period or during its extension periods, by notifying the franchisor within two calendar years (whether successive or not), in which case the agreement would terminate at the start of the calendar year that immediately follows the year in which the second notice was given. If a franchise agreement is terminated due to a franchisee failing to meet its contractual obligations or at the franchisee’s request before the end of the current contractual period, the contract provides that we retain the right to receive our annual royalties and communication fees provided for under the agreement until the end of the initial duration of the franchise agreement. In addition, franchisees are obligated to return our signage upon termination, in order to avoid any confusion for end-customers. The termination of a franchise agreement remains rare and we continue to grow our franchisee network given we believe our franchise model is mutually beneficial to the franchisee and franchisor. As franchisor and in accordance with our obligations under the franchise agreement, we have the following obligations: - providing our franchisees the know-how, expertise and training necessary to operate their business; - allowing franchisees to use our brands and merchandizing as well as allowing them to use our central listing and purchasing unit and our commercial offers; and - developing and implementing publicity campaigns and communications at our level. As franchisee and in accordance with its obligations under the franchise agreement, the franchisee must in particular respect the following obligations: - paying ongoing royalties as indicated above; - purchasing their products exclusively from suppliers listed by our central listing and payment unit; - complying with certain requirements in terms of merchandizing and store layout, so that brand identity is aligned and the same store concept is used throughout our networks; - implementing our commercial strategy and promoting our commercial offers; - contributing to communications and advertising expenses and submitting any local advertising initiative for our approval; - purchasing samples of and displaying our branded products in their stores; - reporting sales levels on a monthly basis (franchisees may also report other performance indicators, such as sales by product and total number of products sold); - providing us with a copy of their annual accounts; - granting us a right of first refusal in the event that they seek to sell their business or retire; ----- - adhering to a non-compete clause prohibiting affiliation with a competing network, which typically extends for one year after the termination of the franchise agreement; - adhering to certain confidentiality provisions; and - following the termination of the franchise agreement, ensuring that all manner of trade goods and fixtures pertaining to our brands, including our store concept, furniture, display shelves and signage, are removed from the store. _Franchisee representation_ Our relations with our franchisees are mainly structured around national franchisee commissions (each, a “CNF”) which we have set up in each of the European countries in which we carry out our activities. The CNFs are responsible for (i) collectively representing the franchisees in their relationship with us; (ii) centralizing, simplifying and organizing communications with the franchisor; and (iii) approving certain decisions, such as our marketing plan, which is submitted annually for the approval of the relevant CNF. In France, the optical CNF is composed of 15 members for a term of three years, representing a total population of 392 franchisees, and the CNF for hearing aids franchisees is composed of seven members for a term of three years, representing a total population of approximately ten franchisees. In Spain, the CNF is composed of eleven members, representing a total population of 177 franchisees. See also “Regulation” for a summary of the regulatory framework that applies to our relationship with franchisees. _Franchisee profile_ We ask our franchisees to deliver the customer service and purchasing experience that customers expect from ALAIN AFFLELOU. Forming close, successful partnerships with franchisees based on mutual commercial success is an essential component of our business model. The following presents a profile of our franchisees. _Optical_ On average, as of July 31, 2023, ALAIN AFFLELOU franchisees operated 1.9 optical stores in France, 1.5 optical stores in Spain, and 1.6, 1.1 and 2.5 optical stores in each of Belgium, Portugal and Switzerland. In certain non-European markets, the profiles of our franchisees may differ from those common in Europe, and the Group may enter into relationships with optical retailers managing a few ALAIN AFFLELOU, and acting as master-franchisee. The average sales (including VAT) per ALAIN AFFLELOU store in calendar year 2023 was €872,000 in France (excluding centers only operating hearing aids) and €398,000 in Spain and €300,000 for hearing aid centers in France compared to the market average of optical stores of approximately €550,000 in France in 2021 and €190,000 in Spain in 2021. However, average revenue (including VAT and excluding online sales) for independent retailers was €250,000 in France in 2021 and €83,000 in Spain in 2018. We believe the out performance of stores in our network is mainly the result of: (i) the quality of service that our franchisees provide to customers; (ii) the strong recognition of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand; and (iii) the services that we provide to franchisees which support and assist them in their operations. For further information about our competitive position in the geographies where we compete, see “Industry”. Our ten largest franchisees (across our network and jurisdictions) own and operate an average of ten stores, representing 8.3% of network sales in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023. The biggest one operated 15 stores (excluding corners) as of July 31, 2023. Thus, we believe that we are not dependent on any one franchisee. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, 20 new franchisees representing 21 stores, joined ALAIN AFFLELOU in France, entering our network either through openings or purchases of existing stores from franchisees. ----- _Hearing aids_ As of July 31, 2023, our 91 hearing aid franchisees in France operated an average of 4.1 points of sale, distributed between 1.9 centers (a store dedicated to hearing aids) and 3.2 corners inside optical stores. In Spain, our hearing aid franchisees operated on average 2.3 points of sale, distributed between 1.0 center (a store dedicated to hearing aids) and 1.3 corners inside optical stores. For more information regarding our network and our main geographies, see “—Distribution channels”.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Our business,18.6.2,Services that we provide as franchisor,"As franchisor, we provide our franchisees, both before the opening of their store and throughout the course of their operations, advice and support services. Our services as franchisor, the relationships formed with franchisees and the interaction between us, our franchisees and end-customers are intended to increase franchisees’ sales. The following section describes the characteristics of our brand, which is regularly reviewed, either through customer surveys performed by various institutions in France and Spain for the whole sector and studies that we commissioned as well as a brief description of the know-how that we provide our franchisees. _Financing solutions for franchisees_ As part of our franchisor role, we offer different financing solutions for developing franchisees’ activities: - _New store openings. Opening an optical or hearing aid store requires capital. In an effort to attract a new generation of franchisees and accelerate the transition of certain of our directly-owned stores into franchised stores, we piloted a financial support program. This program, called “Project Adelante” (“PA”), began in Spain in 2013 and was extended to France in 2016. As of July 31, 2023, approximately 140 of our stores in Spain and France have benefitted from our PA program, and some of these have already reimbursed us. The aim of the program is to help qualified opticians with strong entrepreneurial ambitions transition into successful franchisees. Those who are selected to participate in the PA program are provided training in various fields such as management and finance. In Spain, we provide financial support to these opticians by guaranteeing bank loans obtained from partner banks, which facilitates opticians’ access to financing, which is necessary at the start of their franchisee business. In France, we help finance the new franchisee by purchasing convertible bonds issued by the new franchise company, helping it obtain the equity cushion it needs to qualify for bank financing. As part of the PA program, potential and/or future franchisees can be hired by us as managers of directly-owned stores in order to increase the potential and/or future franchisee’s knowledge and experience, before taking over a franchise store. - _Working capital financing. We have negotiated financial support for our franchisees with consumer finance lender Cofidis, our partner with our NextYear financing solutions to end customers. As a complement to the partnership with us on credit consuming activity, Cofidis makes available a working capital advance to our franchisees, for which we pay the interest, to allow them to pay for signature label eyewear products put on display one year after purchase. In addition, we have put in place several framework agreements with partner banks to finance refurbishment, store design or working capital needs. These agreements allow our franchisees to access external financing at preferential conditions compared to those they would receive from their usual partners and be subject to less stringent requirements as a result of our support. These agreements can also be used for temporary needs. For instance, more than 400 of our franchisees benefitted from a €20,000 loan in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. - _Assistance relating to relationships with banks and other service providers. In addition to advising and supporting our franchisees, we have selected a number of partner banks, including BNP Paribas, Société Générale-Crédit du Nord and CM-CIC, and service providers (such as accounting networks, including KPMG, Fiducial and In Extenso), that are able to service our franchisee network, and that have a close relationship with, and knowledge of, our network, in order to facilitate franchisees’ financial management. ----- - _Other arrangements. As part of our franchisee management approach, we can, from time to time, offer direct support to our franchisees, either through individual arrangements with franchisees experiencing cash or working capital needs or through postponements of franchisee payments. For example, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Group took various measures to support the financial health of the store network, including by reducing monthly instalments in March, April and May 2020 (for a total amount of more than €30.0 million) and through loans granted by banks and guaranteed by the Group (for a total approximate amount of €15.0 million, of which approximately 450 loans of €20,000 were granted by our partner Cofidis in the NextYear offer under the framework agreements described above). Where we offer payment deferrals, the network team, together with the financial and the legal departments, creates reimbursement plans and franchisees enter into agreements that govern and set out their commitments and related guarantees. Thanks to strong sales recovery and the loans described above, there were no outstanding amounts on deferred payments of our franchisees as of July 31, 2023. _Advertising and communications to build strong brand awareness_ Since our founding, we have developed significant know-how in terms of advertising and communications. Our communications strategy focuses on promoting the reputation of our brands, as well as educating customers about our commercial offers and new products bearing our own brands. Our commercial offers are relayed by television, our websites and apps, text message, e-mail, social media, billboards, radio and print, through marketing campaigns or sponsorship opportunities and by in-store signage. Our multimedia advertising campaigns and communications strategy are intended to be memorable, resonate with customers and inspire confidence in our opticians and audio prosthetists, while informing customers of our commercial offers. These campaigns and communications also drive footfall to our stores. Our communications efforts are carefully monitored with the assistance of advertising agencies, notably through the analysis of our gross advertising expenses compared to our competitors in our main geographies and performance of our “share of voice” in various media. We regularly assess our brand awareness in countries in which we have a significant market share, using market studies we commission, such as OpinionWay for France, Belgium and Switzerland and Punto de Fuga for Spain. We use these studies to better follow the results of our commercial offers and communication campaigns. We also look at third-party consumer surveys (not conducted at our request), which we regularly purchase from various companies specialized in our markets, such as Arcane and Gallileo in France. As shown below, ALAIN AFFLELOU ranks number one, either in spontaneous or assisted awareness in France, as pointed out by several and periodic customer survey studies, summarized below.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,Our business,18.6.3,,"Our principal activity is acting as a franchisor, allowing our franchisees to trade optical and hearing aid products under our brands. Pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreements that we enter into with each of our franchisees, we authorize our franchisees to use our brands and sell our owned branded products, grant them the right to distribute optical products and/or hearing aids under the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand, allow them to use our commercial offerings and provide them with a variety of tools, services and know-how. We encourage our franchisees to deploy our innovative commercial offers through our overall communication strategy, including publicity and communication campaigns to promote our brands and drive traffic to their stores. Our communication strategy showcases the strength of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand through a diverse array of initiatives, with a primary focus on nationwide outreach bolstered by digital tools, including SMS and email campaigns. In addition to our communication campaigns, we organize the overall communication of our brand on behalf of our franchisees. The best practices that we develop in our directly-owned stores are shared with our franchisees and serve as a benchmark for the standard maintained throughout our entire network. We have also put in place a comprehensive supply, purchase and logistics system for our franchisees. Additionally, we sell optical products that bear the “AFFLELOU” signature label, which are distributed to franchisees as a means to extend their product range. The services that we offer our franchisees as franchisor aim to develop, support and foster the business of our franchisees. We believe that the services we offer to our franchisees allow them to develop their business, increase their performance and offer consumers a better shopping experience while continually reinforcing the image of our brand.

Some of our franchisees also won the award of best hearing aid and optical franchisee in France in 2018 and 2020 by the Fédération des Réseaux Européens de Partenariats et de Franchise (IREF). Other than national campaigns, our communications team also supervises local and temporary advertising initiatives to promote the opening or reopening of stores. In such cases, advertising expenses are financed by the relevant store, but our communications team assists the store in managing the campaign. Prior to a franchised store opening for business, our development department works closely with the franchisee to prepare a local communications and outreach plan to maximize impact and visibility for their store’s first trading days. Our strong media presence allows our brand to enjoy a strong reputation. ALAIN AFFLELOU is firmly embedded in customers’ minds particularly in France, which we believe is considered to be a preeminent retail destination for eyewear. Our strong brand image is built on several pillars, including our history of five decades of innovation in terms of communications and commercial offers. For more information regarding our track record of introducing new products and offers see “—Products and _commercial offers”. The strength and reputation of our brand is also premised on the quality of service_ that we provide our customers. We believe that the services we provide our franchisees as franchisor enable franchisees to concentrate their efforts on their business which in turn allows customers to enjoy better services from franchisees and their employees, enhancing the reputation and image of our brand and our network. _Procurement, purchasing and logistics solutions_ As franchisor, we provide our franchisees with many services related to procurement, purchasing and logistics. These services generate franchisor revenue through fees charged to our suppliers, who in turn benefit from access to our franchisees and store networks. We also earn revenue through the resale of certain optical and hearing aid products by us to franchisees. Purchasing solutions refers ----- collectively to the following activities: (i) our central listing unit and payment unit; (ii) purchasing and licensing; and (iii) trading. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, we generated 42.2% of our revenue from our procurement activities for our franchisees. _Central listing and payment unit_ As independent retailers, our franchisees are free to select products to sell in their stores, choosing among the suppliers that are listed by our central listing and payment unit (allowing us to always offer a choice of several suppliers for each product). We are committed to offering flexibility by providing a selection of approved suppliers rather than mandating a single option. Franchisees are free to determine products’ resale price. However, for optical products sold under our own brands, we set the maximum price. The central listing unit encompasses all listed suppliers and their products that are approved to be sold in our store networks. We have a dedicated division which is responsible for compiling and updating the list of suppliers and products. Among our listed suppliers are the main frame, lenses, contact lenses and sunglasses manufacturers in the market, as described under “— Sourcing” and certain smaller players who wish to be listed and meet our requirements. Stores in our networks may also suggest that a particular supplier be listed. The purchases made by our networks allow us to negotiate advantageous commercial terms with each of our suppliers and enter into framework agreements with them on behalf of the stores in our networks, thus creating significant economies of scale. Framework supplier listing agreements are renewed every year and do not provide for volume commitments. Additionally, our listed suppliers may take advantage of our central payment unit. Stores in our network are required to purchase all products sold, such as frames, lenses, contact lenses and other optical products in their optical stores, and hearing aid devices, batteries, and other hearing products in their hearing aids points of sale exclusively from suppliers that are listed by our central listing and payment unit. We generally also serve as an intermediary to facilitate payment between our networks of stores and our listed suppliers, simplifying relations between the two. The listing and payment process are the following: - _Ordering. The relevant store/franchisee sends its order to the listed supplier. The majority of orders are processed electronically. - _Delivery of goods/invoicing. The supplier delivers the goods ordered and sends the invoice to the store/franchisee. - _Summary statement. Each month, the supplier sends to the franchisor a summary statement of goods invoiced to each store/franchisee. We collect summary statements from all suppliers and provide franchisees a monthly statement listing all invoices due to suppliers. - _Payment to suppliers. We pay suppliers net of discounts and listing fees, rebates in accordance with negotiations with the central listing unit and del credere commissions billed as part of listing fees. - _Payment from stores. Stores/franchisees pay us in one sole payment amounts due to all the suppliers who have invoiced them, net of discounts and rebates that we negotiate on their behalf. We invoice listed suppliers for the following: - listing of supplier commissions; - centralization of franchisees’ payment commissions (listing and centralization of payment are generally two services combined in the central listing structure); - _del credere commissions, which correspond to the guarantee provided by the franchisor for the orders of the stores within our networks; and - early payment allowances in case of a cash purchase or an early payment made by us. ----- Our invoice system is identical in France and Spain, except that in Spain some suppliers choose to bear the store’s default risk, and therefore do not pay for a del credere commission. Similar arrangements are in place in Belgium, Luxembourg and Switzerland, allowing franchisees in countries where our presence is less developed to benefit from the same services as those provided to our historical locations and use suppliers that can sell to stores in such countries. Franchisees in non-European jurisdictions and in Portugal can access these listing services and receive support from our sourcing and supply chain team for some of the listed suppliers. _Purchasing and licensing_ In order to offer franchisees better prices, mainly on lenses and contact lenses, we aggregate purchases by leveraging the size of our store networks, generating significant economies of scale. As of July 31, 2023, corrective lenses, frames, contact lenses and care solution and sunglasses represented 60.2%, 20.9%, 9.2% and 9.7%, respectively, of franchisees’ purchases through our central listing and payment structure. As a result, franchisees are able to benefit from discounts and rebates we negotiate with suppliers when they make purchasers through our central purchasing units, of which we retain a share. We also make available to stores in our networks our own-brand lenses and contact lenses, which are lenses and contact lenses manufactured by third parties that are among the largest in the industry (such as Hoya, Coopervision or subsidiaries of the Essilor-Luxottica group) and are distributed by us. We charge manufacturers of our own-brand lenses and contact lenses a licensing fee for use of our brand names. Such licensing fees are calculated as a percentage of the supplier’s sales to stores in our networks. _Trading_ Our trading branch (ALAIN AFFLELOU Brands) acts as a supplier by which we resell exclusive or own-brand products within our own networks. This activity mainly involves frames and sunglasses that we sell under our own brands. We directly sell exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in our networks either through logistics providers or directly. Our exclusive frames and sunglasses consist of (i) signature label frames and sunglasses bearing the AFFLELOU signature (currently under two main collections: the Tchin Tchin collection, which is mainly dedicated to our multi-possession offer of “buy one get an additional or two additional pairs of glasses for one euro more” and our innovative Magic collection of frames and clips); (ii) frames and sunglasses under exclusive licenses; and (iii) exclusive collections. As part of our trading activities, we retain a margin on the resale of exclusive frames and sunglasses to stores in our network. Finally, trading activities can be an entry point for new countries by allowing us to test consumers’ reactions to our own branded products and our other product lines. For more information about our exclusive and own-brand products, see “—Products and commercial _offers—Products” and “—Sourcing, branding and manufacturing—Sourcing”. During the fiscal year_ ended July 31, 2023, our license purchasing and trading activities as well all of our purchase solutions for supplying our franchisees totaled €146.9 million, i.e., 16.8% of network sales. _Support services Overview_ We have been operating for five decades and have gained significant experience in managing our distribution networks, allowing us to master all aspects of our role as a franchisor and the management of our directly-owned stores. When a new franchisee signs a franchise agreement with us, a long-term partnership is formed, involving the transfer of knowledge, monitoring, sharing and refining of best practices. This section details the know-how that we provide and continue to expand, hone and update, based on everyday interactions with our franchisees and the realities of their business needs. For a description of the IT solutions that we provide to our franchisees see “—Information technology”. _Store location planning_ Store location planning refers to a range of services and value-added tools that we employ to assist existing and incoming franchisees determine where to place their stores, which is often the most ----- important consideration for the health of their businesses. As the largest optical product franchisor in France, we have knowledge and experience that allows us to knowledgeably advise franchisees on store locations using data that we have compiled based on information received from each of the stores in our networks in the past decades. In addition, the Group has recently entered into an agreement with a geo-marketing company which provides a study of each envisaged location, in terms of traffic, optical need, and clientele potential. Our target catchment areas are medium- to large-sized urban communities. Pursuant to our contractual arrangements, every franchised store location must be approved by us prior to opening its doors. We are also able to analyze store potential based on, among other things, the proximity of competitors, which are part of the studies conducted by the geo-marketing company, and our Development Teams. We can also connect potential franchisees with local contractors, helping them evaluate offers for refurbishment and outfitting and arrange store visits to existing stores in similar locations. In addition, our analyses of our existing stores’ network sales, including information gathered from our customer relationship management system, provide insights that enable our franchisee sales and network Development Teams to identify favorable whitespace in areas where we operate in Europe. Following such analysis, our Development Team can actively seek out prospective franchisees in such areas where we believe they are more likely to be successful, further bolstering the network’s presence in these areas. _Store design_ ALAIN AFFLELOU stores are known for their distinctive color schemes, elegant displays and intuitive retail store layout. We have developed a range of products and services for franchisees in order to present customers a consistent, high-quality shopping experience across all our store networks and maintain brand integrity. We provide comprehensive store design and layout solutions, including selling distinctive retail furniture and wall display pieces, which creates a similar welcoming feel in each of our stores. To maintain this, we have obtained design protection from the relevant authorities for certain of our custom-designed retail furniture to ensure that they are adequately protected. Our current store design is called “Champs Elysées”, after our flagship store, which we recently refurbished under this new concept. As of July 31, 2023, 406 of our ALAIN AFFLELOU stores in France were managed under the new Champs Elysées concept with 89 stores refurbished in the last twelve months up to April 30, 2024. _Training and development_ We provide extensive training for franchisees and their employees, to enable them to meet the high standards that our customers expect of our stores. As part of the initial training provided to franchisees, we have a program that familiarizes franchisees with our business model and acquaints them with the representatives and regional managers who will be their primary contacts. Initial training includes programs covering, among other things, advertising and local communications, inventory management and planning and using our order fulfilment system. Our “ALAIN AFFLELOU Academy” provides training courses for franchisees and their employees in France and was expanded to Spain through “ALAIN AFFLELOU Academia de Vuelo” in April 2014. In April 2016, our training programs became available online. The training sessions that we offer cover, in particular, sales techniques for different optical products such as sunglasses and children’s glasses, effective store and personnel management as well as commercial strategies. The AFFLELOU ACADEMY training school is dedicated to developing and maintaining the skills of staff at both the head office and in stores, including both DOS and franchises. In France, the AFFLELOU ACADEMY holds the Qualiopi certification from ARNOR CERTIFICATION. This certification ensures the professionalism of our school and allows our franchisees to receive financial support from the Opérateurs de Compétences (OPCO). The Academy’s mission is to introduce new optical and hearing aid employees to our brand, products, and offers, support the Group’s sales policy, enhance and refine the commercial, managerial, and technical skills of employees, and ensure consistency and uniformity of practices within the AFFLELOU Group. Our Academy also caters to specific requests by providing customized training courses. AFFLELOU ACADEMY delivers e-learning, virtual classroom, and in-person training at our headquarters in La ----- Défense and other locations across mainland France and the French overseas departments and territories. In 2023, the Academy trained 3,743 individuals, totaling 11,000 hours of training, with a satisfaction rate of 94.6%. _Certification_ Certifications granted by independent providers have become an important commercial consideration for consumers, as a symbol of professionalism and integrity, as well as for the process of joining closed networks in France. We have mobilized to assist and guide our franchisees in obtaining certifications in order to further enhance our standing among customers. In 2014, we set up a hotline to assist franchisees with the documentation required to obtain Afnor and Veritas certifications. In addition, regional managers maintain and update lists of franchisees that have obtained such certifications in order to analyze the resulting benefits and impact of such certifications. In order to help our franchisees navigate this process, we provide our franchisees with an information guide and place them in contact with the company France Certification to attend training sessions on these certifications. We provide support for obtaining AFNOR-REF 230 (Service Agreement – Optical Quality) certification to our and franchised stores. AFNOR-REF 230 certification aims to improve the quality of customer service and satisfaction, in particular by: (i) guaranteeing care from a trained and educated professional, working in close collaboration with an ophthalmologist; (ii) offering products at a good price/quality ratio due to a rigorous selection process of lenses and frames suppliers; (iii) offering the option for no upfront costs, with costs being paid by the public health system and the OCAMs; and (iv) offering a follow-up service to monitor changes in the customer’s prescription during its validity. Similarly, we provide support for obtaining VeriSelect Quality Optician Services to all of our directly-owned stores and franchised stores. VeriSelect Quality Optician Services are issued by the Veritas Certificate Bureau and recognized by OCAMs and care networks. The goal of this certification is to guarantee consumers that certified stores provide reliable service, are professional and attentive in particular by: (i) respecting clear and legible commitments made to consumers; (ii) guaranteeing a well-adapted space by identified and competent professionals; (iii) providing explanations in terms of equipment choice; (iv) providing uniform invoices including the consumer’s healthcare data; and (v) providing personalized and confidential service and follow-up in terms of the quality of service. _Assisting with access to care networks in France_ Since 2014, we have provided our franchisees with information and assistance in qualifying for and joining the French care networks. We feel that membership in a care network enables franchisees to attract a larger number of customers. However, joining a care network can be a costly and burdensome process involving preparation of submissions to tenders and related complex documentation. In 2015, we institutionalized our care network support activity. Currently, our care networks manager assists our opticians and audio prosthetists in preparing and submitting bids by providing guidelines, bespoke advice via a hotline and preparing standardized support documentation. For example, when a care network issues requests for proposals as part of a tender process, our care networks manager analyzes the selection criteria and provides a summary to our franchisees and directly-owned store managers. Certain training and certification costs associated with this initiative are invoiced to the franchisees. As a result of various efforts to support franchisees, as of July 31, 2023, 83.0% of the stores that operate in the ALAIN AFFLELOU network in France are part of one care network and 68.0% are part of two or more care networks. For more information about care networks and a description of care networks, see “Regulation—France—Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system”. _Management and operational support_ If a franchisee encounters difficulties within the scope of their operations, we also provide a certain number of assistance and advice services. In 2014, we launched a campaign called “Elite” that assisted and helped franchisees whose results were below expectations. This initiative involved a full range of management and operational support, including in respect of merchandising, product range, training, cash management, store refurbishment and inventory optimization. Monthly follow-ups were arranged in order to quickly monitor progress, identify new developments and respond accordingly. This program reinforced our relationships with our franchisees and harmonized customer service and customers’ shopping experience across our networks. We believe that this program was successful in improving ----- the performance of certain stores which, without this support, likely would have closed. In 2021, we launched a new Elite campaign, covering approximately 15 stores in France, with the aim of providing support to franchisees in the operational management of their stores, including inventory management, purchasing strategy and offer positioning. In 2022, inflation was strong and had the potential to impact the financial performance of our franchisees. Therefore, we made the decision to start a new Elite campaign to provide operational support to a list of approximately 50 stores which we identified had the potential to benefit from this campaign. _Legal_ As part of operating a store, franchisees may encounter legal problems related to their optician or audio prosthetist business or for example, labor law difficulties. In order to respond to these specific labor law difficulties, we provide legal support services to our franchisees. _Human resources and sales force incentives_ Recruiting, retaining and rewarding qualified staff is an important component that underpins our success. We operate a central clearinghouse for recruitment of trained and newly-graduated opticians and audio prosthetists from recognized institutions. Franchisees can also utilize this platform for their recruiting needs. _Consumer financing solutions_ Finally, we have negotiated with consumer finance lenders (in particular Cofidis) to provide payment facilities to customers who purchase products through our NextYear commercial offers. NextYear enables customers of our networks to pay for their eyeglasses, contact lenses or hearing aid products, generally in twelve equal monthly payments without interest or other charges. We serve as an intermediary between consumers and these finance lenders and do not incur any credit risk as part of this program.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Distribution channels,18.9.1,Store network,"_Generalist activity_ We believe the founding of ALAIN AFFLELOU helped create the modern optical retail sector in Europe by focusing on customer needs and affordability. As of April 30, 2024 we had a total of 1,434 stores compared to 1,397 stores as of April 30, 2023. Of these stores, 812 were optical product stores located in France (compared to 808 as of July 31, 2023), 358 were optical product stores located in Spain (compared to 355 as of July 31, 2023), and 152 were optical product stores located in Other countries ----- (compared to 147 as of July 31, 2023). As of April 30, 2024, our networks included 1,322 ALAIN AFFLELOU optical stores (compared to 1,310 as of April 30, 2023) and 559 hearing aid points of sale (compared to 510 as of July 31, 2023). We operate three different types of stores: downtown stores, stores located in shopping malls and stores located in retail parks. We believe that store organic growth has further potential to increase through the addition of hearing aid corners. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, optical stores with a hearing aid corner generated an additional like-for-like growth of 2% on average, in the past five years compared to the optical stores without hearing aid corners. _Optical – France_ In France, as of April 30, 2024, our networks comprised 812 ALAIN AFFLELOU optical stores (808 stores as of July 31, 2023). In France, ALAIN AFFLELOU stores are concentrated in and around medium- and large-size urban areas. We are also present in the main French overseas departments and territories. In recent years, we have emphasized the opening of franchised stores outside of city centers, responding to changing consumer preferences. Stores situated in shopping malls or in retail parks offer more floor space with larger parking facilities, lower rents and generally lower refurbishment costs. Furthermore, Sunday trading and longer opening hours are possible in malls and retail parks, whereas they are generally not possible in city centers outside of certain high traffic areas in larger cities. Our directly-owned stores in France are part of our strategic decision to support our franchisees and our brand, including through operating city center and shopping mall stores for flagship purposes in and around Paris and other key strategic locations, as well as maintaining a group of stores for testing new offers and instituting best practices. Finally, certain directly-owned stores comprise former franchised stores that had encountered difficulties and have been transitioned to direct ownership in order to address operational issues before securing a new franchisee operator. See “—Distribution channels— _Development and management of our store networks” for more information. Optical – Spain_ In Spain, as of April 30, 2024, our networks comprised 368 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores. In comparison, our network in Spain consisted of 122 stores as of July 31, 2006, 263 stores as of July 31, 2011, and 363 as of July 31, 2023. Our directly-owned store network in Spain (which is proportionally larger than our directly-owned store network in France) consists of: (i) flagship stores located in city centers and shopping malls, these stores allow us to anchor our presence in major urban areas; (ii) stores to test new business initiatives, product concepts and innovations and identify best practices; and (iii) a group of certain former franchised stores that resulted from repurchases of such stores from former franchisees who retired or withdrew from the business during the economic crisis from 2009 to 2013. In particular as a result of our financial support program called “Project Adelante”, we intend to shift a large portion of such stores to franchisees. _Optical – Other countries_ - In Belgium and Luxembourg, we had 54 ALAIN AFFLELOU franchised stores as of July 31, 2023. In Belgium, these stores are mainly located in Wallonia, the francophone region of Belgium, though in recent years, we have developed our activity in Flanders. We do not directly own any stores in Belgium or Luxembourg. - In Portugal, we had 26 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores as of July 31, 2023 primarily located in the country’s main urban areas such as Lisbon, Setúbal, Porto, Braga and Faro, of which 20 were franchised stores and six were directly-owned. ----- - In Switzerland, we had 20 ALAIN AFFLELOU franchised stores as of July 31, 2023. We do not directly own any stores in Switzerland. We are also present through franchisees or master franchise agreements in Other countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and South America. Afflelou-Paris, which focuses on our French beginnings and fashion know-how, is the generalist name that we intend to use for our international development in non-French speaking countries. We currently manage 22 stores in Morocco, three stores in Kuwait and eight stores in Georgia (which consist of store corners inside other retail stores). _Hearing aids – ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien_ Our founder, Mr. Alain Afflelou, is best known as an optician. However, he is also a trained audio prosthetist. After observing that the hearing aid market did not feature a player that combined technological innovation with attractive commercial offers, we launched the ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien brand, which built on the reputation of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand, the trust that customers placed in this brand and changing commercial offers we have historically offered. ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien also benefits from the use of the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand, known on the optical products markets for its products and innovative commercial offers. As of July 31, 2023, ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien comprised 510 hearing aid points of sale (including 376 corners inside ALAIN AFFLELOU optical stores and 99 centers only selling hearing aid products in France, of which 127 points of sale in Spain and seven points of sale in Belgium). As a comparison, at July 31, 2016, we had 244 hearing aid points of sale (of which 190 were in France, and 54 were in Spain). In Spain, we reached a level of 127 hearing aid points of sale (119 corners and 8 centers) as of July 31, 2023. The chart below shows the evolution of the number of points of sale in our hearing aid network in France and Spain between July 31, 2017 and April 30, 2024. _Source: Group information._ In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, approximately 87.6% of our network sales of our hearing aid business was generated in France, accounting for €55.1 million of sales (excluding VAT). The majority of our points of sale are corners hosted in ALAIN AFFLELOU optical stores. We believe that hearing aid corners allow optical product consumers to discover our hearing aid products and are likely to generate significant clientele for audio prosthetist franchisees. Likewise, we believe that the addition of a hearing aid corner to an optical store is likely to create additional sales for the optician. For example, during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the optical product sales of ALAIN AFFLELOU stores in France with a hearing aid corner outperformed the rest of the optical ALAIN AFFLELOU French network at an average rate of 2% in the past five years on a like-for-like basis. We intend to continue to focus on synergies of our two businesses, including combined offers to end customers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Distribution channels,18.9.2,Development and management of our store networks,"_Franchised stores_ Our franchisees independently operate one or several stores under our banner. As franchisor, we continuously interact with franchisees in order to promote their activity and increase their performance. We have put in place at the local level an internal surveillance and communications system with our franchisees, allowing us to maintain and promote brand integrity, and gather sufficient information about our franchisees’ businesses. A regional network manager works with franchisees at the regional level of each geographic zone and across our network. Regional network managers in France and Spain organize training and exchange initiatives with franchisees and visits of model directly-owned stores. These initiatives enable us to share the most up-to-date know-how and expertise with our franchisees in terms of store layout, merchandizing, best commercial practices and sales techniques. Regional network managers are employed by us and act as intermediaries between our management and franchisees. In smaller markets, regional network managers are generally responsible for an entire market, grouping together several countries, depending on the number of stores that we maintain in a given market or region. We have implemented an internal monthly scoring system for each store and franchisee, which enables us to process data collected from franchisees, our central listing and payment units, our central purchasing units and suppliers. In addition, our “ALAIN AFFLELOU Academy” and “ALAIN AFFLELOU Academia de Vuelo” also provide additional levers to gauge franchisee engagement, the success of our latest commercial offers and franchisees’ commitment to the relevant banner. Our scoring system evaluates various aspects of our relationships with franchisees, such as purchases, revenue, implementation of our commercial strategy, sales of exclusive products, relationship quality and status of payments. As a result, we are able to identify low performers among our franchisees, and work with them towards improving their performance. Our central management determines the goals and analyzes franchisees’ results. Regional network managers regularly contact our central management and oversee various activities, such as the communications, franchisee network development, financial management or the logistics departments, allowing them to improve uniformity of practices and provide data for all our store networks.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Distribution channels,18.9.3,Developing networks and recruiting new franchisees,"_Europe_ In Europe, our strategy for developing franchise networks concentrates on maintaining robust and dynamic networks of optical franchisee-entrepreneurs and continuing to build a growing audio prosthetist-entrepreneur network for our hearing aid business. As of April 30, 2024 we operated our hearing aid business mainly in France and Spain. We have begun to expand this business to Belgium and Switzerland, with seven and three corners in those countries as of July 31, 2023, respectively. Our franchise Development Team is responsible for increasing the number of franchised stores and uses the following methods: (i) recruiting through specialized press, at trade shows and at events organized at optician and audio prosthetist training schools; (ii) targeted recruitment of independent retailers and franchisees trading under other banners at locations that have been identified as important zones for us; and (iii) a multi-banner, multistore and multidiscipline strategy. Additionally, we provide introduction services to help connect opticians with audio prosthetists to encourage the introduction of hearing aid corners which can yield increased footfall for both businesses. For a summary of the regulations applicable to us in connection with sales of franchisees in France see “Regulation”. Outside our core markets of France and Spain, our strategy is to further extend our European footprint in countries in which we are already a national player, mainly Belgium and Luxembourg (54 stores, as of April 30, 2024 and 54 stores as of July 31, 2023), Switzerland (20 stores, as of April 30, 2024 and 20 stores as of July 31, 2023) and Portugal (26 stores as of April 30, 2024, and 26 stores as of July 31, 2023) to become a leader in those markets by deepening our franchise network and exploiting opportunities for ----- consolidation, given the high level of fragmentation of these markets. In both Belgium and Switzerland, we are mainly present in French-speaking regions, but we have a presence in Flemish-speaking regions of Belgium and in a mixed French and German-speaking region of Switzerland. _Outside of Europe_ Internationally, we seek franchise networks in certain markets where we believe demand would be high enough and that stores would be able to attract customers. Historically we have expanded in countries where there has been a strong connection to French culture, entering into contracts with local entrepreneurs who had an awareness of and affinity for our brand and value proposition. We perform due diligence on prospective international franchisees to maintain brand quality and determine whether the franchisee would be suitable to implement our commercial offers and preserve the image of the brand. Our international rollout strategy to penetrate new geographies rests on three pillars that reduce the risk we take on when we expand into new geographies: (i) we first enter a new market through wholesale activities to test the appetite for our branded products, while limiting our exposure and investment risk, (ii) if this first phase is successful, we replicate our proven franchise model, with limited capital expenditure and execution risk and (iii) we then expand our store network in the new market, using our proven business strategy. In such countries, we generally try to operate with partners that are already active in the optical business, ideally that are already managing several optical stores. In such cases, such as in Kuwait, we may operate under a master-franchise agreement. _Directly-owned stores_ Our core business is our franchisor activity. To support our franchisor role, we also directly operate a portion of the stores in our networks. At April 30, 2024, we operated 76 directly-owned stores in France (compared to 83 as at July 31, 2023), 89 directly-owned stores in Spain (compared to 88 as at July 31, 2023) and six directly-owned stores in other countries (compared to six as at July 31, 2023). For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, directly-owned stores generated 30.4% of our total revenue and 14.3% of our network sales. Our directly-owned stores operate under the same legal framework as franchised stores, particularly through the intermediary of an intra-group franchise agreement. We invoice our subsidiaries operating directly-owned stores for the same type of fees that we receive from franchisees. _Objectives_ We believe that operating directly-owned stores is a fundamental component of our global franchisor strategy in that it allows us to better manage our networks. Our operating strategy regarding directly-owned stores rests on four pillars: - _Maintain control of our flagship stores and anchor our brand in key symbolic and strategic locations. In order to maintain, increase and promote the brand equity of our banners, we believe we must be present at certain highly visible locations. Between ten to 20 stores are located in symbolic locations such as the Champs-Elysées or La Défense in Paris, Gran Via in Madrid and the Graça neighborhood in Lisbon. These stores are located in big cities and tend to be on the more well-known shopping boulevards that are frequented by domestic and international tourists. Controlling these stores directly allows us to utilize them as walk-in advertisements and analyze customer’s behavior and their experience. Rent and refurbishment are critical aspects of our business that we control, and associated costs of such stores are generally too high for a franchisee in these locations. - _Test and refine new commercial offers and establish best practices. Continuous commercial innovation and retail best practices have assisted us in developing networks of leading optical and hearing aid retailers in the countries where we operate. The stores in this category comprise between 50 to 100 stores, primarily in large urban areas and shopping malls with strong visibility where we test and adapt our commercial offers. Such stores serve as models for our entire network in terms of testing new commercial initiatives before rolling them out to the full network and establishing operational and retail best practices. Current and prospective franchisees are ----- frequently invited to visit such stores as part of training. Our ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien corners, the Afflelou Sun corners, the new software for managing points of sale, sales force incentives, supply chain monitoring and consumer data analytics tools are initiatives that were initially developed and tested in our directly-owned stores. - _Perform network management and buttress our expansion strategy in strategic areas. In order to efficiently manage and develop our networks, we may temporarily acquire certain franchised stores, and subsequently transition such store to a new franchisee in the short to mid-term. The reasons for opening or assuming the direct management of a franchised store include, among others, the need to ensure that we do not lose a particular site in case of the retirement of a franchisee, material disagreement with a franchisee regarding commercial policy or the need to turn around an underperforming store. Such stores can be operated for a time as directly-owned stores before transitioning to franchisee ownership, which sometimes involves assistance with financing by us. This “buy and sell strategy” is held on behalf of the franchisor, to manage the whole network. - _Leverage purchasing power. Our directly-owned stores structure enables us, in some cases, to negotiate conditions for the whole network, as we are able to commit to comparatively large purchase volumes. Our strategy is to reduce our directly-owned stores portfolio in France to the Paris region, and large stores needing significant financial means, like in big shopping centers. We intend to retain the directly-owned stores corresponding to the flagship and key strategic locations as well as those stores for testing commercial, operational and logistics initiatives. Our long-term target for our directly-owned store networks is to operate 100 to 150 directly-owned stores in the areas where we already operate. _Leasehold arrangements_ Substantially all of our directly-owned stores are subject to commercial leaseholds. The following provides a brief description of our leasehold arrangements in France and Spain, where the majority of our directly-owned stores are situated. French commercial leases generally have a minimum initial duration of nine years, but rarely exceed twelve years. The lessee has the right to terminate a commercial lease at the conclusion of each three-year period. The lessor may only terminate the lease at the conclusion of each three-year period in certain limited circumstances. At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the lessee is entitled to a renewal. If the lessor refuses such renewal, the lessor will be required to compensate the lessee, unless the lessor can show good cause. Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the lessor and lessee take no action to renew or to terminate the lease, the original lease will be automatically renewed until a notice of termination is served by either the lessee or the lessor. An automatically renewed lease may be terminated at any time by either the lessee or the lessor providing that six months’ prior notice is given. The parties are free to determine the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the property at the signing of the contract. The rent may be fixed, variable or composed of a fixed portion and a variable portion. Generally, the lease contains an annual rent indexation clause. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or to the purpose of the lease. Alternatively, parties can choose the Commercial Rent Index (ILC) (indice des loyers commerciaux) or the Index Applicable to Leases of the Service Sector (ILAT) (indice des loyers des activités tertiaries), both published by _l’Institut national de la _statistique des études économiques (INSEE), the French public statistics institute. In Spain, although_ the legal framework for commercial leases is less strict (i.e., commercial leases are not subject to a specific legal framework), commercial leases are identical to those in France. However, rent is often calculated as a percentage of turnover with a minimum lease amount being determined by the parties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Distribution channels,18.9.4,Products and commercial offers,"_Products_ Our philosophy and our added value, are premised on the idea that the customer can appreciate the extent of our product offering and highlight the price-quality ratio of our products. These factors are essential components of our model. This same philosophy inspired the creation of ALAIN AFFLELOU Acoustician, which relies on the main characteristics of price, choice and accessibility. We offer our franchisees a range of refined and affordable optical and hearing aid products such as prescription glasses, ready readers, sunglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, batteries and various other items. Our goal is to provide a product range that exceeds the choice offered by our competitors. Within our network, we offer a varied product range. For example, ALAIN AFFLELOU stores have the largest range with a certain number of luxury brands, but also midmarket brands and signature label collections. Optical products offered under our own brands include both ophthalmic frames and sunglasses, contact lenses from the leading market players and other accessories. We do negotiate purchasing terms on behalf of our networks, such as discounts and rebates which allows us to order, including through our procurement, larger quantities and enjoy advantageous conditions. The following presents a brief description of the type of products that we list in our central listing and purchasing unit. _Frames and sunglasses Products that we sell under our own labels_ Since 2014, we have supervised and sub-contracted the production of eyewear collections featuring the “Afflelou” signature. These optical products allow us to expand the product offer in our stores and demonstrate our innovative capacity to customers while also providing franchisees and directly-owned stores with attractive margins on these products. In the countries where we are present, signature label products are only available at ALAIN AFFLELOU stores. The products that we market under our own brands are specifically designed to be fashion-forward yet affordable, and are compatible with the economic model of our Tchin Tchin commercial offer (a second pair of our signature label eyeglasses for €1.00). According to a survey on brand awareness in frames, the products that we market under our own brands are among the most well-known frame brands in France, with a strong awareness among both women and men. The frames that we market under our own brands ranked first in unaided brand awareness but before such frame brands as Ray-ban and luxury brands such as Dior, Gucci and Chanel according to Arcane customer Surveys in 2023 and 2022. The products that we market under our own brands are generally positioned in the middle market and appeal to customers seeking a brand name who may also be attracted to our multi-possession proposal that the Tchin Tchin offer allows (second pair of eyeglasses for €1.00). For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, the products that we market under our own brands represented approximately 44.1% in value of frames sold to our ALAIN AFFLELOU stores. Past years have been marked by the success of our Magic collection, a collection of frames with magnetic clips for a variety of purposes, including sun protection, blue-light filtering and night driving. As such, our own brand is not only using banner awareness to promote mid-range price offerings, but also obtain rankings of being the most innovative banner thanks, among other items, to our own private labels. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, approximately 1.4 million Magic frames (equipped with magnets) and 1.3 million Magic clips were sold in our network. We decided recently to shift all AFFLELOU frames to Magic, enabling any ALAIN AFFLELOU glasses wearer to benefit from our clips covering multi usage and in every situation for our customers. _Other brands and third-party names_ As part of these offers, we negotiate the exclusive right to distribute ophthalmic frames and sunglasses collections from third-party brands. These ophthalmic frames and sunglasses are designed and produced by third-parties and are exclusively distributed across the networks of ALAIN AFFLELOU stores. For more information about our suppliers, see “—Sourcing, branding and manufacturing— _Sourcing”. We also negotiate licenses for the design, product and marketing of ophthalmic frames and_ ----- sunglasses. We select these products, subcontract their manufacturing pursuant to our specifications and market them under the brands for which we have obtained a license. _Third-party manufacturers’ products_ Our networks offer a large range of products manufactured by leading producers of optical products. Through our central listing and payment unit, we allow the stores in our networks to access almost all optical products available on the market. _Lenses and contact lenses Proprietary products_ We have been marketing our own products under our own brands (Tchin Tchin launched in 1999, Éphémère in 2002, Protect in 2006, Égérie in 2011 and Magic in 2017) and exclusive products that have been licensed by us to certain third-party suppliers. These exclusive products, which cannot be found outside of our stores, provide franchisees with a competitive advantage by leveraging our advertising and communications to increase customer interest in our offering. Own-brand lenses and contact lenses are lenses and contact lenses distributed by us through our central purchasing units or by one of our suppliers in the context of a commercial offer. Manufacturers that we select to produce these exclusive products are generally leading industry operators, such as Hoya or subsidiaries of Essilor-Luxottica in respect of lenses and Coopervision and Menicon in respect of contact lenses. They are selected for the quality of their products, as well as for the logistics services they provide. When distributing own-brand lenses and contact lenses, we invoice licensing fees to suppliers. Such licensing fees are calculated as a percentage of the supplier’s sales to franchisees and directly-owned stores. _Other products_ We also offer a range of third-party lenses and contact lenses from large suppliers in particular lenses from Essilor-Luxottica, Carl Zeiss and Seiko and contact lenses from Bausch & Lomb, Alcon and Johnson & Johnson. _Commercial offers and marketing strategy_ We regularly launch commercial offers to drive traffic and increase sales in our stores. Many such commercial offers originated in France but have been successfully exported to Other countries where we operate and have become just as recognizable in such countries, particularly in Spain. The success of these commercial offers in different markets builds and reinforces the dynamism and attractiveness of our stores, in France or in another country. The evolution of our commercial offers illustrates our constant desire to create added value, enhance the lives of our customers and offer a new and unique selling experience to franchisees. In the early days of our operating history through the 1980s, the commercial offers were focused on price, democratizing the optical product market and rendering it more accessible. In the 1990s, we began to focus on products, offering the first private label lenses and ready readers (which would eventually include contact lenses starting in 2002), which transformed our brand to signify not just a retailer, but also a provider of cutting edge products. In 1999, we introduced multi-possession with our Tchin Tchin offer that, for one franc (or €1.00), gives consumers the chance to own another pair of eyeglasses at very low additional cost, which was expanded with Tercera in 2004. The Tercera program was eventually transformed into a Summer/Winter promotion that offered two additional pairs of glasses for €1.00 more. In 2009, during the economic crisis, we launched NextYear to allow customers to have access to optical products and maintain a relatively low price. In 2017, we launched “Smart Tonic” (which we have since renamed “Magic”), a collection of frames with magnetic clips for sun protection, blue-light filter and night driving. In 2020, we launched “Serenity”, insurance coverage for breakage and ----- theft of glasses with very limited cost for the end customer. In 2024, we launched “Caractères”, a new collection of fashion frames, in the mid-high range segment. The following table lists and describes our most significant and innovative commercial offers, most of which are still currently available in our store networks:",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

These initiatives seek to provide customers with a forum that is always available to our customers and potentially increase traffic into stores and convert such visits into sales by familiarizing customers with our products.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Online activities,18.11.3,Online sales,"We sell mostly sunglasses, ready readers, contact lenses and contact lens solutions online, as these categories do not require vision exams or fitting and consumers are less likely to want to try out the products before purchasing. Online sales are made through our websites, which offer free shipping to stores and, in certain countries such as France and Spain, directly to customers’ homes with a service charge. Each sale completed through our websites is allocated to a physical store (either franchisee or directly-owned) that is nearest to the customer, thus avoiding cannibalization of sales. We operate the online pure player, Malentille by AFFLELOU, on the Malentille.com website, which is focused on online sales of contact lenses, while the ALAIN AFFLELOU online activity is dedicated to a broader range of products. We are currently rationalizing our e-commerce offer across the various brands, alongside a digital transformation plan which aims to simplify the customer journey with ALAIN AFFLELOU.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.11,Online activities,18.11.5,,"In 2012, we decided to develop our online sales activity. Progressively, we took a series of strategic decisions related to our online sales activity that we currently assemble in a single global digital offer. Notably, we are exploring the possibilities of increasing our online presence due to regulatory changes introduced as part of the Loi Hamon in 2014. Currently we maintain websites in the languages of the ----- principal countries where we operate, namely in French, Spanish, Portuguese and Flemish for ALAIN AFFLELOU and in French and Spanish for ALAIN AFFLELOU Acousticien. According to a market survey of French respondents conducted in 2018, the ALAIN AFFLELOU website was tied for first among the most visited websites in connection with a purchase of eyewear, and in first position when visits are cumulative. Additionally, in September 2016, we acquired two online pure players, Happyview.fr and Malentille.com, both of which engaged in the online sale of optical products. Happyview.fr was a website that sold corrective lenses and frames and was approved by the French Health Ministry and the French social security system. We have integrated the Happyview.fr activities into our French Afflelou website and we began selling corrective glasses on Afflelou.com in 2020. Malentille.com is a website that has sold contact lenses in France since 2006 and will continue to serve customers on its own platform with back-end integration with the Group’s online activities. For further information regarding the online sale of optical products, see “Industry”. The online eyewear activity has been relatively slow to catch on in Europe due to regulatory constraints which require a prescription prior to the sale of corrective eyeglasses, consumer shopping patterns that favor trying on eyewear in person and a lower sales penetration rate generally than the United States, for example. For further information regarding regulatory constraints in our main markets, see “Regulation”.

We provide a customer service hotline which answers queries from customers and franchisees regarding our products and commercial offers. We have put in place a team dedicated to this activity in France. In addition, we feel that all the services that we provide in our role as franchisor to the members of our networks fully contribute to improving customer service. We regularly receive awards for our offering and our customer service. We have also won a number of industry awards in both France and Spain, such as optical customer service provider of the year by the _Elu service client de l’année_ (ESCDA) market survey, conducted by Viseo Customer Insights, in France for eight years in a row (from 2017 to 2024), “Óptica del año” by Inma Stratmarketing for best optician in Spain in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022, “best franchise in shopping centre” by the Asociación Española de Centros Comerciales in 2018 and “foreign franchise with the best implantation in the Spanish market” by the Asociación Española de Franquicias in 2018, as well as for our television and video advertisements which customers easily recall, and the National Optics and Audiology Award 2022 in Optics and Audiology Franchise of the National Optics and Audiology XXI Century Awards and the 2022 Award for Best Franchisee in Spain by the Spanish Association of Franchisors.

These suppliers are among our most important suppliers during the last three years. For products that we market under our own brands, or for which we have obtained a license to produce, Okia and its network of independent factories in Asia has historically been our preferred intermediary for the external manufacturing of our exclusive products. Okia, which is a Chinese intermediary, is not a manufacturer but rather puts us in contact with a network of independent factories in Asia and allows us to obtain manufacturing conditions all while enjoying a unique commercial relationship. We also source part of our own collections from a Japanese manufacturer that is specialized in value-added products. For more information, see “—External _manufacturing”._ Our main interactions with our suppliers consist of: (i) negotiating common commercial terms and conditions that benefit all of our networks; (ii) purchasing and reselling optical products, namely lenses and contact lenses; (iii) arranging the manufacturing for our signature brand eyewear and licensed products; and (iv) entering into arrangements with suppliers pursuant to which such supplier partners provide logistics services and support to benefit our franchisees and directly-owned stores.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.13,"Sourcing, branding and manufacturing",18.13.2,Branding activities,"In 2014, we created our “Afflelou” signature label, which comprises a range of ophthalmic frames, ready readers and sunglasses. Our product design team (for our signature brand collections and licensed product collections) is composed of designers and product managers based in Geneva. In order to develop our new collections, the product design team selects designs based on the latest trends and analysis of sales information from previous collections. We endeavor to continually introduce new models and update existing models while maintaining best sellers. In terms of ophthalmic frames and sunglasses, approximately 2.5 million Afflelou-branded frames and sunglasses (including 1.4 million Magic_ pairs) and 1.3 million _Magic_ clips were delivered to our network in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2023, and a variety of new SKUs are introduced each month allowing us to continuously renew our product offering. We have made the decision to systematically equip our frames with magnets, so that our Magic collection almost completely covers the full range of our frames, with magnets that allow clients to use various clips with the frames. Our product design team curates pieces for our signature brand products based on hand-drawn sketches and computer-rendered technical drawings provided by our manufacturers. The technical drawings are then used to define colors, materials and styles. Our creative director approves each technical design before being confirmed to the manufacturer for prototype creation. In order to subcontract the production of a large number of SKUs that we market under our own brands, we make use of flexible manufacturing that allows a range of SKUs to be created each year with low incremental cost. This technique allows us to continuously renew our product offering by delivering a fashionable flair at a lower price point than luxury brand eyewear.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.14,Logistics,18.14.1,,"We outsource our logistics functions with our supplier partners and a logistics partner through a special plan called “facing fix” which is designed to reduce the level of stock in our networks of stores. We have entered into agreements with certain of our exclusive lens suppliers (notably Essilor-Luxottica and Hoya) with respect to the storage of a buffer of inventory consisting of signature label frames and sunglasses. As a result of this arrangement, Afflelou brand frames and sunglasses purchased by end customers (either as a first product, or a second or third pair as part of the Tchin Tchin commercial offer) can be ordered by each franchisee selling such product together with the relevant lenses from such lens suppliers if they request that the supplier handles cutting and mounting for the Tchin Tchin glasses. The lenses and the frame arrive together so that the opticians may mount and fit them in the store. In other cases, the frames will come from our logistics partner. This allows stores in our network to generally maintain only one display unit of each of our signature brand frames and sunglasses in the store and make multiple sales of such products per day. Stores only order a product from a supplier after the customer has confirmed the order. For contact lenses, our warehousing and logistical support is also performed by the aforementioned external partner managing part of the exclusive frames products. We sell contact lenses through our central purchasing unit, which also acts as a dedicated ordering, logistics and fulfillment portal (which we refer to as “Call”), both to franchisees and end customers through our various online offers. The external partner manages the inventory and then fulfils the order once it has been confirmed. Finally, for the stock of non-prescription sunglasses that we sell under our own brand, our European partners manage the logistics and fulfilment of orders by franchisees. Third-party products that are ordered by franchisees and directly-owned stores from any listed suppliers through our central listing unit are delivered directly to the relevant store by such third parties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

IT systems that we manage include accounting and human resources software solutions, network monitoring, central purchasing and central listing and payment systems, communications systems and office equipment. We house our systems on two cloud-based datacenters. Our IT team works with major in-store optical software providers and has developed a common, customized interface for us and our store network (called “Entrenous”). Franchisees are able to choose the in-store software provider of their choice from among our relationship suppliers. In-store software is purchased directly by the relevant franchisee. The following briefly describes the main software platforms (proprietary, licensed or combination of both) that we consider important to carrying out our activities: - _Call: The Call platform is an ordering, logistics and fulfillment portal accessible by directly-owned stores and franchisees that enables them to directly place a global order for lenses and frames with one of two global supply partners (Essilor-Luxottica or Hoya) and receive the fitted eyewear directly from such supplier; - _Entrenous: In-house point of sale software interface loaded onto selected third-party point of sale software; and - _Cimsup: Licensed platform that provides inventory tracking for directly-owned stores to assist in monitoring the sale of proprietary frames. - _Salesforce: we have implemented Salesforce software to manage our customer database and more generally our customer relationship management program since 2017. - _Microsoft PowerBI: we have implemented the Microsoft PowerBI solution to manage franchisees’ performance. We have dedicated significant effort in recent years to improve the tools that are available to end-customers, building up a large client database (both nationwide in France and Spain and at-store level), which is linked to and fed by our franchisees’ point of sale systems and allows us to collect day-to-day data on network performance. We are currently focused on growing the proportion of franchisees that are sharing their client database with us (currently more than 90% of the total number of stores in France and nearly 100% in Spain). Our long-term ambition for our digital transformation plan is to significantly expand the end-customer data we have access to and explore opportunities to link this information more closely to the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand, which we expect to be assisted by a growing proportion of end-customers sharing their data and using our digital platform.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Our main insurance policies, entered into with reputable insurance companies, cover types of exposures including the following: - general business liability insurance in regard to our headquarters, which covers real estate and property damage, business interruptions and third-party claims; - fraud insurance, which covers costs related to harm to our brand and reputation; - franchisor civil liability insurance; - directors’ and officers’ civil liability insurance; and - cyber risk insurance. Our insurance policies contain exclusions, caps and deductibles that could expose us to unfavorable consequences in the event of a significant event or legal action against it. Moreover, we may be required to indemnify third parties for certain damages that are not covered by our insurance policies or to incur significant expenses that may not be covered, or may be insufficiently covered, under our insurance policies. In addition, the efficacy of our insurance coverage depends on the ongoing viability of our insurers.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Legal and arbitration proceedings,18.20.1,Reassessment of the Group’s VAT deduction from the French tax authorities,"In December 2017, the Group received a notice of a proposed reassessment from the French tax authorities following an audit relating to VAT deduction made by Optical Finance (the franchisor operating the Optical Discount brand), an entity we acquired in July 2015, for the period from January 1, 2014 to November 30, 2016. The French tax authorities concluded that Optical Finance participated in a VAT tax evasion scheme during such period. The French tax authorities’ reassessment included adjustments amounting to €1.5 million (€966,000 in tax reassessment, €386,000 in penalties and €134,000 in late payment interest). Following receipt of the letter from the French tax authorities confirming the reassessment for its full amount on August 16, 2018, the Group first provisionally decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal of the reassessment (€966,000) and, subsequently, decided to pay all the penalties and late interest, thus meaning that the total reassessed amount of €1.5 million has been fully paid to date and that no unfavorable cash impact is thus expected in respect of this tax reassessment. We decided to challenge the decision, and on March 5, 2019, the French tax authorities rejected our claim. Therefore, we decided to contest this decision before the French administrative tribunal of Paris and thus filed a claim on March 29, 2019, which was rejected by said court on April 6, 2022. The Group then decided to appeal this decision before the French administrative court of appeal, which also rejected our request in a decision dated January 30, 2024. As we believe we still have arguments to put forward, the decision as to whether we should lodge an appeal with the French administrative supreme court is now being assessed. In this respect, it should also be noted that the Group exercised its call option pursuant to the vendor warranties issued by the vendor’s shareholders relating to its acquisition of Optical Finance (such vendor warranties being however capped at €1 million).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

As a result of this audit, the French tax authorities issued an initial tax reassessment notice, primarily reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss-making subsidiaries in 2010, claiming that the sale price did not reflect an arm’s length transaction. The Group and its legal and tax advisors believe that there are strong arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities. Nevertheless, at the end of 2023, the French administrative court of Montreuil confirmed the tax reassessment proposed by the tax authorities. The Group and its advisors decided to appeal this decision before the French Administrative Court of Appeals in Paris. Our appeal was notified to the Court of Appeals in February 2024. It should be noted that the amount of the potential adjustment that would result from this tax assessment has already been recorded in the Group’s latest financial statements as at April 30, 2024 for €21.1 million on our corporate income tax base, leading to a decrease of our carry-forward tax losses for the same amount. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Compliance with data protection laws must therefore be ensured. Our ability to collect, store and Process such Personal Data is governed by data protection and privacy regulations and guidance issued by, among others, the data protection supervisory bodies in Europe such as the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). The privacy regulations include, for example, the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC. The GDPR provides a common framework within the European Union for data protection and regulates the Processing and transfer of Personal Data. In the course of our activities, we may act as a “Controller” or as a “Processor”, as defined by the GDPR, depending on our role and the capacity within which we Process Personal Data belonging to Data Subjects. As required by the GDPR, we have designated the French Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l’informatique et des Libertés) (“CNIL”) as lead supervisory authority. The GDPR and local legislations in the European Union impose a strict data protection compliance regime including: - the accountability principle, requiring companies to demonstrate and record compliance with the GDPR, including the maintenance of a detailed record of Personal Data Processing activities as required by Article 30 of the GDPR; - the appointment of a data protection officer, in certain circumstances; - the requirements to Process Personal Data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner, to Process Personal Data only to the extent necessary for the purposes required, maintain the accuracy of Personal Data, limit the retention of Personal Data for no longer than is necessary, and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures against unauthorized Processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data; - an obligation to provide clear notice of Personal Data Processing activities to Data Subjects, which must include, among other details: the identity of the Controller; the nature and purpose of the Processing activities; the legal basis applicable to each Processing activity; the categories of Personal Data Processed, the recipients to whom the Personal Data are disclosed; the rights of the Data Subjects; and details of any cross-border transfers of Personal Data; - an obligation to include certain mandatory contractual terms in agreements with certain service providers which Process Personal Data on our behalf as required by Article 28 of the GDPR; - restrictions on the export of Personal Data to recipients located in countries outside of the European Economic Area; ----- - obligations to consider data protection issues with respect to the development of any new products or services which involve the Processing of Personal Data (“data protection by design”), and to ensure that by default, the amount of Personal Data Processed is limited to what is necessary in the context of the relevant Processing activity (“data protection by default”); - a requirement to undertake a data protection impact assessment with respect to Processing activities that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of relevant Data Subjects as required by Article 35 of the GDPR; - obligations to comply with the data protection rights conferred on Data Subjects including, in certain circumstances: a right to be informed; a right of access to Personal Data; a right to rectification of Personal Data; a right to obtain restriction of Processing; a right to object to Processing; a right to data portability (i.e., to request that Personal Data be transferred to another Controller); a right not to be subject to certain types of profiling or automated decision making; and a right to request erasure of Personal Data; and - an obligation to notify Personal Data Breaches to Supervisory Authorities without undue delay and no later than 72 hours after detection of the relevant Personal Data Breach, except where the Personal Data Breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, and an obligation to notify affected Data Subjects without undue delay, if the Personal Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the affected Data Subjects. The GDPR introduces fines for serious breaches of up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20 million. The GDPR identifies a list of points to consider when determining the level of fines to impose (including the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement). Data Subjects also have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses (e.g., distress) in certain circumstances. Data Subjects may bring complaints via the courts, or via Supervisory Authorities, or both, and in some circumstances may have a choice as to the EU Member State(s) in which they bring such claims.

Franchisees are in principle deemed to be independent entrepreneurs. The _Loi Doubin and certain provisions of the French Commercial Code provide certain protections to franchisees in the context of the entering into of a franchise agreement and franchisors are subject to regulations preventing undue interference of a franchisor in franchisees’ business operations, as well as requiring that franchisors provide certain information to franchisees and potential franchisees. For example, franchisors are required to provide potential franchisees, or current franchisees contemplating the opening of a new store, with certain information at least 20 days prior to entering into a franchise agreement. Such pre-contractual information (“Document d’Information Précontractuel” or “DIP”) should address, among other things, the franchisor’s performance, network, industry, local market and terms of the franchise agreement. French law also contains various other important provisions that could apply to franchising relationships including for instance specific rules and requirements regarding (i) payments that may be required prior to conclusion of the franchise agreement and their consideration, (ii) duration and termination of contracts in the context of “commercial distribution networks” (“réseaux de distribution _commerciale”), as well as (iii) non-competition provisions and, in particular, post-contractual relationship_ non-competition provisions.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,France,58.2.4,Regulations governing the optical product and hearing aid market in France,"_Access to the optician and audio prosthetist professions_ Opticians are licensed professionals who are able, generally subject to a prior prescription, to perform eye tests, advise on the selection of corrective lenses and dispense such products for the purposes of vision correction. To qualify as an optician in France, students must complete a post-baccalauréat degree of two years, and a three-year degree. Students must obtain a certificate in optical studies (Brevet de Technicien Supérieur Opticien Lunetier, or “BTS”, or brevet professionnel d’opticien-lunetier) or benefit from an equivalent certificate or practical experience in another European Union Member State as well as from an individual authorization to practice in France. To qualify as an audio prosthetist in France, students must obtain a specific audio prosthetist diploma (Diplôme d’État d’audioprothésiste) or any diploma enabling a person to operate as a physician in France or benefit from an equivalent diploma or practical experience in another European Union Member State as well as from an individual authorization to practice in France. _Sales of optical and hearing aid products_ The French Public Health Code (Code de la santé publique) historically provided that commercial establishments whose primary purpose is to sell optical products may only be supervised or managed by qualified opticians. However, in 2014, the Loi Hamon or La Loi relative à la consommation (Consumer Affairs Law no. 2014-344 dated March 17, 2014) amended the French Public Health Code (see Art. L. 4362-9) such that it is no longer necessary for managers of an optical retail store to be qualified opticians. Nevertheless, optical retail stores must still employ at least one qualified optician during business hours, who will be responsible for the sale and delivery of corrective lenses and contact lenses. The _Loi Hamon also authorized the sale of optical products over the Internet in France (see Article L. 4362-10-1, implemented by Decree no. 2015-1223, as described below) and requires that ophthalmologists systematically specify on their prescriptions the interpupillary distance, which is one of the key details needed to correctly fit a pair of glasses. Similar to the regulations limiting the sale of optical products, the French Public Health Code provides that only audio prosthetists may sell hearing aids in a place compliant with applicable French regulations (See Articles L. 4361-1 et seq.). Unlike optical equipment, the online sale of hearing aids is not authorized in France. ----- Since January 1, 2018, retailers of optical and hearing aid products have been required to provide consumers with additional price and product information. The French Ministry of the Economy and Finance published a ministerial order on April 28, 2017 that requires all optical and hearing aid product retailers and service providers to clearly indicate in their stores that customers will receive a free and detailed estimate before any purchase (Articles 1 and 2) and must display the prices for products and services (Article 3). These same requirements apply to online retailers. The estimate must comply with a standard form annexed to the ministerial order. All estimates must be maintained for at least one year after they have been provided to a customer (Article 4). In addition, retailers are required to inform their clients of certain information concerning optical and hearing aid products such as the country of origin (Article 5). _Data protection_ Since entry into force of the GDPR, we are not required to make filings with the Commission Nationale _Informatique et Libertés or request authorizations with the same entity (except in respect of certain very_ limited exceptions), to process personal data. The GDPR requires that companies that handle personal data adhere to the GDPR’s principles relating to processing of personal data and comply with certain recordkeeping and processing requirements and be able to demonstrate compliance with the aforementioned requirements. In addition to the GDPR, French data protection Law no. 78-17 dated January 6, 1978 as modified applies in France. In the ordinary course of business, opticians and audio prosthetists in our networks receive and store confidential, personal and sensitive data, such as medical, social security and health insurance information with respect to customers, and are therefore subject to privacy and security regulations with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health and personal information. In December 2015, the EU approved the GDPR with respect to data protection. The GDPR enhanced existing legal requirements through several new rules and includes stiff penalties (up to the higher of €20 million and 4% of global turnover) for organizations that fail to comply. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all member states since May 2018 and to all European Economic Area member states thereafter. In addition, following the adoption of the GDPR, on January 11, 2017 the EU Commission published a proposal for an e-privacy regulation to replace the existing e-privacy directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Discussions for the adoption of the e-privacy regulation are ongoing, on the basis of the latest proposal agreed on February 10, 2021 by the Council of the European Union. The European Data Protection Board published on November 14, 2023 its draft Guidelines 4/2023 on the technical scope of Article 5 paragraph 3 of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC on “tracing”. _Prescription system_ A medical prescription is required to purchase corrective lenses and contact lenses in France. The French Public Health Code provides that any doctor is entitled to practice all diagnostic procedures for both prevention and treatment. In practice, ophthalmologists ordinarily prescribe corrective lenses and contact lenses. Decree no. 2016-1381 dated October 12, 2016 regarding the conditions for issuing corrective lenses and contact lenses and the regulations governing the exercise of the profession of dispensing optician, issued by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and last modified by a Decree n°2020-475, introduced a number of changes mainly concerning the conditions for issuing optical products. Pursuant to this decree, a prescription from an ophthalmologist for correct lenses is generally valid for five years (unless provided otherwise by the ophthalmologist), with some exceptions for patients in certain age groups, while the first prescription for contact lenses is valid for one year. Unless expressly stated otherwise by the prescribing doctor, the optician may adapt the medical prescription on renewal following a refraction test. In the event of loss or breakage of corrective lenses and in the case of an emergency, the optician may issue corrective lenses without a medical prescription. A medical prescription is also required to purchase hearing aids in France. Ear, nose and throat specialists or a general physician benefiting from a specific training are allowed to prescribe hearing aids. Currently, a prescription for hearing aids is valid for one year. Following the 100% Santé reforms, there is now the option for licensed opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by French public health insurance and OCAMs, up to €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago. ----- France is experiencing a shortage of ophthalmologists and the 2015 _Loi de Santé (Law no. 2016-41 dated January 26, 2016 to modernize the French healthcare system) is an effort by the French government to address this shortage by allocating certain responsibilities to opticians, in particular, when renewing a prescription, opticians can adapt the original prescription, unless the doctor objects (see Article L. 4362-10 of the French Public Health Code). Law no. 2023-379 of May 19, 2023 reinforced the responsibilities of opticians since it provides in its article 12 that opticians can, during the first delivery of corrective glasses or contact lenses following the prescription, adapt this prescription after written agreement from the prescribing practitioner. The powers of orthoptists have also been strengthened since they can, since Decree no. 2022-691 of April 26, 2022 (supplemented by the Order of the Ministry of Health and Prevention dated January 25, 2023), issue the original prescription for optical equipment under certain conditions (in particular to patients between 16 and 42 years of age). Furthermore, faced with the problem of some territories in France lacking ophthalmologists, the French legislator has regulated the possibility of carrying out remote teleconsultations. Thus, the social security financing law of 2023 provided for the conditions of obtaining approval for telemedicine companies, such approval allows these companies to ask health insurance to cover teleconsultation procedures carried out by the doctors they employ (Article L4081-1 of the Public Health Code), with such provisions coming into force as of December 31, 2023. The regulation of telemedicine continues, with in particular the publication by the High Authority of Health commissioned by the French government of a framework of good practices and evaluation methods applicable to teleconsultation companies on December 21, 2023 and recommendations on locations and environmental conditions for the carrying out of a teleconsultation or telecare on February 29, 2024. In this last document, the French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé) clearly indicates that “the installation of telehealth equipment must be done as a priority in places of care where a healthcare professional practices”, which includes optical and hearing aid stores where opticians and hearing aid specialists work. To the extent that telemedicine is practiced from stores in our network, we may be impacted by regulations on telemedicine which are currently being established. _Medical Device Regulation Order no. 2022-582 of April 20, 2022 adapts French law to EU Regulation 2017/745 relating to medical devices._ The social security financing law for the year 2023 provides for several provisions relating to medical devices in general, which form part of the social security code. These include but are not limited to: - Article L165-1-1-1 of the Social Security Code which provides that when the operator of a medical device is not the manufacturer of the product, such user is required to declare the price at which he purchased the product from of its supplier. This provision supplements Article L165-2-2 of the Social Security Code which provides that any operator or supplier of a retail distributor of medical devices is required to declare annually to the Economic Committee for Health Products their sales prices per product. The objective being to give the Economic Committee for Health Products transparency over the prices throughout the sales chain of a medical device. - Article L165-3-4 of the Social Security Code, which will only be in force on the dates and conditions set by decree (not published) no later than December 31, 2025. This article provides for the possibility for the ministers responsible for the economy, health and social security to set the distribution margins for medical devices, taking into account the evolution of costs, income and the volume of activity of the practitioners or companies concerned. It also provides for the ability for these ministers to set a maximum percentage of discounts that a supplier of medical devices may grant to a retail distributor, within the limit of 50% of the operating price excluding taxes. During the adoption of this article, the French Minister of Health indicated that this provision was not intended to call into question the reform of 100% Santé and that it would not have the effect of setting a limit sales price on basket B (i.e., the free basket, or categories of optical products which are not reimbursed at 100%, but rather are reimbursed depending on the purchaser’s arrangements with their OCAM) nor of capping the margins of players on this basket; while refusing to expressly exclude optical and hearing equipment from the text. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.2,France,58.2.5,Regulations governing the French complementary health insurance system,"In France, the public health system and private health insurers (OCAMs) complement each other to provide reimbursement for a significant portion of optical and hearing aid expenses. The French complementary health insurance system generally allows third-party payment (tiers payant), which was implemented to facilitate and encourage access to healthcare. Through this scheme, reimbursement of medical expenses is paid directly by the public health system or OCAMs to healthcare providers. The public health system ordinarily pays a small portion of optical and hearing aid product costs, with the remainder paid by OCAMs. For example, the public health system covers approximately 5% of optical product costs, compared to approximately 65% reimbursed by OCAMs, a proportion that is set to rise with the reforms of 100% Santé, depending on the category of expense. Nonetheless, the public health system plays a significant role in the optical and hearing aid product markets, as reimbursement by OCAMs is generally conditional upon reimbursement by the public health system. Over 99% of the French population was covered by private health insurance plans or CMU as of 2020, according to Gallileo. Today, most of the OCAM contracts that are subscribed in France are considered “responsible” contracts and as such, they are entitled to preferential tax treatment (according to _La Direction de la _recherche, des études, de l’évaluation et des statistiques, over 98% of policyholders benefits from_ responsible contracts). For a contract to be deemed “responsible” it must comply with a number of criteria, including a subscription fee that does not vary depending on the health condition of the subscriber. Additionally, as of April 1, 2015, in accordance with Decree no. 2014-1374 relating to the content of the complementary health insurance policies benefiting from tax and social aids (which modified Articles R. 871-1 and R. 871-2 of the French Security Health Code, further amended by Decree n°2019-21 of January 11, 2019), the imposition of minimum and maximum thresholds on reimbursements of optical products became a criterion required for an OCAM contract to be qualified as responsible. The maximum threshold for qualifying as “responsible” has been set at €800 for a pair of glasses. In general, the maximum price for a pair of glasses with unifocal lenses is €420 and €800 for a pair of glasses with multifocal lenses (including a maximum of €100 for frames irrespective of the type of lenses used). Moreover, the French government has established a “Price Observatory” which monitors and may adjust these thresholds in the future. Additionally, since the entry into force of Decree no. 2014-1374, the maximum renewal frequency, initially one year, has been changed to two years (other than for children under 16 years old or in case of a change in prescription). Care networks (“réseaux de soins”) are third-party platforms organized by insurers that act as intermediaries between OCAMs and healthcare professionals, including opticians and audio prosthetists. Opticians that join a care network agree to certain rules imposed by the care network, including maximum prices for the products they sell or quality certifications. Furthermore, customers purchasing optical products from a store that has joined a care network may also benefit from third-party payment (e.g., payment directly by the OCAMs). Care networks are authorized under Article L. 863-8 of the French Health Security Code provided that certain requirements are met (e.g. the criteria for joining the network must be objective, transparent and non-discriminatory, without any exclusivity clause, and these networks cannot restrain the patient from freely choosing a health practitioner). Care networks may be either “open” or “closed”, as regards membership by opticians. Open care networks generally have lower entry requirements than closed care networks, as the number of opticians within an open care network is not limited, only subject to certain conditions and opticians may apply at any time to be admitted to an open care network. In open care networks, moderate price rebates negotiated with the opticians are generally estimated at approximately 20% off catalogue prices. Policyholders who choose to go to an “agreed” optician in the network benefit from slightly lower prices with no obligations attached. Closed care networks have a numerus clausus, i.e., they set their own target in terms of number of opticians (balancing the need to cover the territory against the necessity to direct customers to a particular optician within the network), beyond which the network will no longer accommodate any new opticians even if they meet the criteria of the network. In practice, this type of network is created for a period of two to four years, which is renewable through a tender process. ----- Opticians may only apply before a certain deadline, or period of application. Closed care networks are more restrictive than open care networks: tighter rules are imposed on opticians, particularly on the type of products offered to customers and discounts that may be granted (usually between 35% and 40% off catalogue prices for corrective lenses). OCAMs may implement differentiated reimbursement levels, depending on whether a policyholder goes to an optician that has joined the relevant care network or an optician that is outside the care network. OCAMs may provide a lower level of reimbursement to policyholders who purchase optical products from opticians that are outside the care network and a higher level of reimbursement to policyholders who purchase optical products from opticians that have joined the OCAM’s care network. As a result of lower prices and in some cases, differentiated pricing, OCAM’s policyholders will be incentivized to go to the particular optical store within the policyholder’s area, that has joined the care network. OCAMs cannot, on the contrary, provide a different level of reimbursement to policyholders depending on whether they consult a doctor (such as an ophthalmologist) who is within the network (per Article L. 863-8 of the French Health Security Code). In France, individuals with annual incomes below certain thresholds may benefit from governmental aid to access complementary health insurance (the ACS and the CMU-C have been replaced, since November 1, 2019, by the _Complémentaire Santé Solidaire or “CSS”). The ANI_ provides that all employers in France must provide private health insurance to their employees as of January 1, 2016. CSS recipients must choose one complementary insurance program on a list published online on complementaire-sante-solidaire.gouv.fr. Recipients are entitled to a reduction on their annual healthcare premium. In January 2018, the French government began a consultation process in connection with the stated intention of the French Health Minister to improve access to and reduce costs of healthcare services for end consumers. The medium-term objective was to ensure that consumers bear no out-of-pocket costs for certain health-related products, including glasses and hearing aids, by 2021. The new measures create two categories of glasses, with different pricing rules for each category. The first category corresponds to the zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer and the second category is not regulated by the new regime with respect to prices. Both categories however will be covered by new rules regarding product offerings and reimbursement. The 100% Santé measures were confirmed in June 2018 and completed by Decree n°2019-21 and include, but are not limited to, the following provisions for the optical sector: - a “zero consumer cost” (RAC Zéro) offer, which consists of a basic “basket” for unifocal and multifocal glasses (set at approximately €100 and €195, for the most common unifocal and for multifocal glasses with thin, anti-reflective lenses, respectively). All opticians are required to make this offer available to customers, offering a minimum range of 17 frames for adults and 10 frames for children, each in two different colors, totaling 54 different options. Every quote to customers must include a zero consumer cost offer. The basket for frames is set at a maximum of €30. As a comparison, according to a 2024 Gallileo survey, in France, a pair of unifocal glasses costs consumers on average €331 and a pair of multifocal glasses costs consumers on average €534; - a reduction in the reimbursement cap used by private health insurers to €100 for frames compared to the previous cap of €150 and as contrasted with an average cost for frames of €113 (for unifocal lenses) and €158 (for multifocal lenses), according to a 2019 Gallileo survey; and - the option for opticians to make certain view exams, reimbursed by French public health insurance and OCAMs, up to €10, in order to facilitate the repurchase of glasses with a prescription from an ophthalmologist provided, in most cases, less than five years ago. In the hearing aid sector, similar discussions have also been conducted and the zero consumer cost (RAC Zéro) offer for hearing aids has been set more progressively (€1,300 in 2019 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with a co-pay from the customer), €1,100 in 2020 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with a co-pay from the customer) and €950 in 2021 (the price ceiling for “Segment I” products, with no co-pay from the customer)). GfK estimated an average price of €1,552 for a hearing ----- aid device in 2019 which had decreased to an average price of €1,535 by July 2020. Before the full implementation of the RAC Zéro offer for hearing aids in 2021, the out-of-pocket cost of hearing aids was between €700 and €1,000, according to a 2019 Arcane report. As in the optical market, there is, on one hand, a higher proportion of value-added products (such as in-ear devices and remote headphones) and, on the other hand, the increased offering of reasonably priced devices and, since January 2021, the ability for end customers to acquire a hearing aid device (valued up to €950) without any out-of-pocket expense. Pursuant to the 2021 Law on the Financing of the Social Security System, since 2022. OCAMs have to specify in their responsible contracts (as described above) that customers purchasing optical and hearing aid products covered by 100% Santé are able to benefit from third-party payment (e.g., payment directly by the OCAMs).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In France, the optical and hearing aid product markets are highly regulated, as optical and hearing aid products are considered to be medical devices.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,58,REGULATION,58.3,Spain,58.3.2,Regulations governing the Spanish optical and hearing aid products market,"_Access to the optometrist-optician and audio prosthetist professions_ In Spain, optometrist-opticians are holders of optical-optometry university degrees and are thus considered health professionals able to diagnose, treat (without the use of prescriptions) and advise on the prevention of visual deficiencies. Audio prosthetists must hold a Higher-Level Training Cycle (Ciclo _Formativo de Grado Superior) in audio prosthetics in order to provide advice and assist customers with_ hearing aids. ----- _Sales of optical and hearing aid products_ Optical and hearing aid retail stores are considered health establishments and are regulated by Royal Decree 1277/2003, dated October 23, 2003. The Royal Decree is further complemented by regional regulations. Pursuant to such regional regulations, the owner of an optical or hearing aid retail store is required, among other things, to hold relevant administrative authorizations for the opening and operation of the premises. Autonomous regions will grant such administrative authorizations, provided that the applicant meets the personal and technical conditions required for the appropriate development of the activity. Such authorization must be renewed periodically, generally every five years. The owner or the legal representative of the optical retail store must apply with the relevant authorities for the renewal at least six months before the end of the validity of the authorization. In order to alter and relocate optical or hearing aid retail stores, the submission of an application to the relevant regional authorities is required. In addition, any store closing needs to be communicated to the relevant authorities. The owner of the store remains liable for the satisfaction and fulfillment of these obligations. Optical stores must be managed by an optical-optometrist and hearing aid stores must be managed by a hearing aid professional, who will serve as the technical director and whose presence and performance throughout the opening hours is required. The technical director and other members of staff must wear a badge on their clothing identifying their name and professional category. For optical stores, the technical director is required to be registered with the Colegio Nacional de Ópticos and hold a bachelor’s degree in optometry or any other official degree recognized by law for the operation of optical retail stores. For hearing aid stores, the technical director is required to be a graduate of a degree in audio-prosthetics, audiology or have a degree in optometry plus have completed certain training and experience requirements in audio-prosthetics. The technical director of an optical store cannot work in more than one healthcare premise, whereas the technical director of a hearing aid store may, in certain autonomous regions, be permitted to work in more than one healthcare premise. Any changes or replacements of the technical director must be reported to the relevant administrative authority and may only be replaced by another professional with similar qualifications. Facilities used as optical or hearing aid retail stores are required to be physically separated from any activity that differs from the activity of a healthcare facility and shall include the following areas: (i) a general public area; (ii) for optical stores, an optometric area for optometric functions; an assembly area; and a product storage area; and (iii) for hearing aid stores, a dedicated consultation space separate from the rest of the store or a soundproofed audiometry cabin in order to carry out such hearing exams. Optical retail stores shall have certain minimum equipment which may vary depending on whether edging of frames is carried out in conjunction with other stores. _Prescription system_ In Spain, optometrist-opticians may prescribe optical products. Only ear, nose and throat specialists are authorized to prescribe hearing aid products and diagnose diseases, but audio prosthetists can adapt hearing aid products for customers. All optical retail stores must maintain and properly complete an optical prescription registry book that may be replaced by a computerized registration system provided that, every month, the results are recorded on paper. The personal data contained in the registry is subject to the protection guarantees set forth by Spanish data protection law, and handled with the same consideration as personal data relating to health. Registry entries will be supervised and signed by the technical director and made available to the health authorities for a period of five years. Prescription glasses, prescription contact lenses and hearing aid instruments are considered medical devices. All medical devices sold in Spain must comply with CE marking. As medical devices they should be adapted to each person’s needs, following the relevant prescription and any specific requirement provided by medical professionals. Due to their healthcare nature, such medical devices cannot be sold by mail order or online. However, recent case law has expressly allowed online sales of prescription glasses and contact lenses for “replacement products” where the client has sought the individual prescription elsewhere and is able to provide the clinical details to the online store, per a Spanish High Court Resolution 206/2017 on February 8, 2017 in relation to prescription glasses and ----- the decision of the European Union Court of Justice in Case C-108/09 on December 2, 2010 in relation to contact lenses. Replacement products are authorized provided that they do not require any individualization or adaptation to the characteristics of the buyer. _Penalty regime_ Spanish law provides a specific penalty regime in case of non-compliance, either by action or omission, of the requirements and obligations set forth in relation to healthcare premises. Non-observance of the requirements may lead to fines, which may reach five times the value of the goods or services involved in the breach, as well as to the temporary closure of the premises or the termination of the provision of the relevant services until the problem is resolved. _Spanish VAT rate applicable to optical products_ The reduced VAT rate of 10% currently applies to the sale of corrective lenses and contact lenses, frames and care solutions as well as hearing aid products. The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to the sale of sunglasses, cosmetic contact lenses, cases, and cords and chains.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The general framework currently set out by national legislation has been further developed by regional legislation, which has established different technical and healthcare requirements for optical retail stores for the several autonomous regions, in order to guarantee the protection of optical health by implementing a quality assurance system.

As the Issuer has limited assets of its own other than its shares in its Subsidiaries, the Issuer is dependent upon its Subsidiaries for cash to service interest, principal and other payments on the Notes. The operations of the Issuer are conducted primarily through its Subsidiaries and therefore the Issuer depends on the cash flow of such Subsidiaries to possess adequate cash to ensure it can meet its obligations under the Notes.

However, pursuant to the New Intercreditor Agreement, Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and certain Hedging Obligations and, if any, certain other Indebtedness, have been repaid in full. The liens on the Collateral to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees are referred to herein collectively as the “Security Interest”. Any other property or assets over which Security Interest may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Notes and the Indenture would also constitute “Collateral”. The Collateral will be contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference or conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to security providers and their shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations and _Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Guarantees and the Security Interests”. The grant_ and control of the security will also be subject to certain Agreed Security Principles. The Agreed Security Principles provide that certain assets will not be pledged (or the Liens not perfected), including: - if the cost of providing security is not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders; - if there is material incremental cost involved in creating security over all assets of a Guarantor in a particular category of assets, only the material assets in that category will be subject to security; - if providing such security would require consent of any person, subject to certain obligations to take steps to obtain such consent before such assets may be secured or where providing such security would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend to the material detriment of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries in respect of those assets or require any of them to take any action materially adverse to their interests and where (subject to certain conditions being met) such consent cannot be obtained after the use of reasonable endeavors; ----- - if providing such security (i) would be prohibited by statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalization rules, transfer pricing rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction (after the use of reasonable endeavors to overcome the relevant legal limitation, if possible), (ii) would be outside the applicable pledgor’s capacity or conflict with its fiduciary duties, or (iii) could result in any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders; - if in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets, security will not be taken over such assets; and - no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where a Guarantor is not located but perfection action may be required in the jurisdiction of one Guarantor in relation to security granted by another Guarantor located in a different jurisdiction and (where otherwise consistent with the Agreed Security Principles) in any supranational registries agreed between the Issuer and the Security Agent from time to time. The Agreed Security Principles with respect to the Notes will be interpreted and applied in good faith by the Issuer. The Liens securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will also secure the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, and certain Hedging Obligations, if any; _provided, however, that Holders of the Notes will receive proceeds from enforcement of the Collateral_ and certain distressed disposals only after any obligations secured on a super-priority basis, including obligations under the New Revolving Credit Facility and, if any, certain Hedging Obligations or certain other future Indebtedness, have been repaid in full. In addition, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the “—Impairment of Security Interest” covenant below, each of the Issuer and the Guarantors is permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with future Incurrences of Indebtedness, including any Additional Notes, in each case, permitted under the Indenture and other Indebtedness of members of the Group and on terms consistent with the relative priority in right of payment of such Indebtedness under the Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement. In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest will cease to exist by operation of law or will be released, depending on the type of security interest, upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and discharge”, in each case in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. There can be no assurance that the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the Holders, and the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes and the disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and such Collateral may be reduced or diluted under certain circumstances” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes”. In addition, the New Intercreditor Agreement places limitations on the ability of the Security_ Agent to release the Security Interest, by reference to the interests of other creditors. These limitations may include requirements that some or all of the Collateral be disposed of only pursuant to public auctions or only at a price confirmed by a valuation. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness _and Other Arrangements—New Intercreditor Agreement”._ Subject to the terms of the Security Documents and prior to enforcement of any such Collateral, the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be, will have the right to remain in possession and retain exclusive control of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, to freely operate the ----- Collateral and to collect, invest and dispose of any income therefrom and, in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral, will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights and to receive and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distributions (whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing). The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, if any, and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent and security agent under the New Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. The creditors under the New Revolving Credit Facility, the counterparties to the Hedging Obligations secured by the Collateral, if any, and the Trustee have, and by accepting a Note, each Holder will be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the New Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, together with any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the Security Agent on its behalf. Further, the Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the New Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein).

The Security Documents will be entered into by, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent. The Security Agent will enter into the Security Documents in its own name for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders. The Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility and the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, if any, (who will have the equal and ratable benefit of the same Collateral). The Security Agent will also act on behalf of certain future secured creditors. The Security Documents provide that the rights with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent or the parties to the Security Documents. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Documents, Holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security Interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the New Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders. See “—Release of Liens” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the _Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee”. In addition, the terms of the Security Documents themselves provide for assets to cease_ to become subject to security in certain circumstances without need for a formal release, such as the sale of assets which are subject to a charge, or the exclusion of certain assets from a debenture if such assets may not be subject to security (such as, for example, assets that may not be validly pledged, or assets that are subject to a Permitted Lien). The Security Agent will commence enforcement action ----- under the Security Documents only in accordance with the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement. See “—Enforcement of Security Interest”. In the event that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors enters into insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, _réorganisation, liquidation judiciaire, faillite or similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under_ the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the New Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of the New Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

(h) any Taxes that would not have been imposed if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Senior Secured Note for payment (where presentation is permitted or required for payment) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the Holder (except to the extent that the Holder would have been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Senior Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30-day period);

The Payor or the applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will (i) use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment by the Payor of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, in such form as provided in the ordinary course by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction or, if notwithstanding such Payor’s efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not obtained, then such other evidence of payment of such Taxes by the Payor as is reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and (ii) provide such certified copies or such evidence of payment ----- to the Trustee, within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made. Copies of such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at the office of the Trustee by the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Listing Agent if the Notes are then listed on Euronext Dublin.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “— _Optional redemption” and has not defaulted in the payment of the applicable redemption price or all_ ----- conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control Triggering Event, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes, by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee: (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) and the record date; (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered), at the Issuer’s expense, to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the ----- Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will, at the Issuer’s expense, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and admitted for trading on the Global Exchange Market and the rules of Euronext Dublin so require, the Issuer will publish notices relating to the Change of Control Offer as soon as reasonably practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date in a leading newspaper of general circulation in Ireland (which is expected to be _The Irish Times) or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, post such notices on the_ official website of Euronext Dublin (https://www.euronext.com/en/markets/dublin). The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require the Issuer to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations (or rules of any exchange on which the Notes are listed) in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations (or exchange rules) conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations (or exchange rules) and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfied certain conditions. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the New Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the New Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control Triggering Event or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control Triggering Event. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—We ----- _may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event as required by the Indenture, and the change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events”._ In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control Triggering Event” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction (i) which is a Specified Change of Control Event or (ii) which is a Change of Control but not a Change of Control Triggering Event, in each case without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: ----- (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided that (a) all Indebtedness outstanding under the New Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the description of this covenant, and may not be reclassified and (b) all Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph of this covenant that is secured by Liens on Collateral that is accorded super senior priority status with respect to proceeds of enforcement of Collateral under the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement pursuant to clause (1) or (7) of the second paragraph may not be reclassified. Subject to the limitations in this paragraph, if an item of Indebtedness (or a portion thereof) is Incurred or entered into pursuant to a fixed permission and at a later time would subsequently be permitted under a ratio-based permission, unless otherwise elected by the Issuer, such item of Indebtedness (or a portion thereof) shall automatically be reclassified to such ratio-based permission; (2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (13) or (15) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; and (4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greatest of (x) the maximum mandatory redemption, (y) repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) and (z) the liquidation preference thereof. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be: (i) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS and (ii) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness. For the purposes of determining any particular amount of Indebtedness under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness” covenant, obligations with respect to letters of credit, Guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Indebtedness otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “— Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would ----- cause the applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to euro) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the New Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce ----- the right to receive payment of principal, interest or premium, if any, when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to receive indemnification and/or security satisfactory (including by way of pre-funding) to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a responsible officer of the Trustee is informed in writing of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their or its respective nominee), will be considered the sole holder of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Except for the discussion of FATCA (as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”), this discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below) who purchases the Notes for cash at original issue and at their issue price (generally the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and who holds the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code. This discussion does not address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non U.S. tax laws. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or that any such position would not be sustained. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organizations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, S corporations, entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other pass through entities (or investors in such entities), U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States, persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction, entities covered by the anti-inversion rules, persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement and holders of Existing Notes. For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate on the date of receipt. regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest income, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of foreign currency so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognized with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such U.S. holder will recognize income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS and must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder) at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and to all debt instruments thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years), or at the spot rate on the date of receipt, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of the Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has previously accrued in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.46,Characterization of the Notes,21.46.2,Original Issue Discount,"The Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of such Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders of such Notes may be required to include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series of Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID includible in income by a U.S. holder of such Notes is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to such Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note issued with OID at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described above in the third paragraph under “—Stated Interest”. A U.S. holder will recognize exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, determined based on the spot rate on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note other than stated interest will be viewed first as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and second as receipts of principal. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S. source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.46,Characterization of the Notes,21.46.3,"Sale, Exchange, Retirement, Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of Notes","Generally, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Note. ----- If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on such a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency translated at the spot rate on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and, if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder), will determine the U.S. dollar value of such foreign currency by translating such amount at the spot rate on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method U.S. holder makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to such Note translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Stated Interest”. If a U.S. holder uses foreign currency to purchase a Note, the cost of the Note will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder (and if it elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates, with respect to the principal thereof, will generally be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “— Stated _Interest” or “—Original Issue Discount,” as applicable) will be recognized only to the extent of the total_ gain or loss realized by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note will generally be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition. In the case of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals), any such gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by or on behalf of a U.S. holder at the rate applicable to such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk rules). Certain Treasury Regulations that apply to non-U.S. income taxes paid ----- or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 further restrict the availability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by the non-U.S. jurisdiction, although the IRS has provided temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these regulations until new guidance or regulations are issued.

Assuming the Issuer’s position is respected, any such additional payments would generally be taken into account by a U.S. holder at the time such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s usual method of accounting for tax purposes. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, the treatment of the Notes could be materially different from what is described herein, including with respect to the character, timing and amount of income, gain or loss recognized. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of the Treasury Regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments and the consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In addition, a U.S. holder that is not an exempt recipient may be subject to backup withholding unless it provides a taxpayer identification number and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements.

Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are published in the Federal Register generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Issuer is treated as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Notes only if there is a significant modification of the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this grandfathering period. Under proposed regulations, any withholding on foreign passthru payments on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered would apply to passthru payments made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments. Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Certain non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Comments which are included therein are reported only for information purposes and do not aim at giving a complete analysis of the tax rules that may affect the Issuer, the Notes and the investors (in particular, this summary does not address any French estate or gift tax considerations).

Payments of interest and assimilated revenues made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes, as applicable, will not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (État ou territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (a “Non-Cooperative State”) other than ----- those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, irrespective of the holder’s fiscal domicile or registered headquarters. If such payments are made outside France in a NonCooperative State other than those States or territories mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the FTC, a 75% withholding tax is applicable to such payments (subject to certain exceptions and to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty) by virtue of Article 125 A III of the FTC. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté) and amended from time to time. The list of Non-Cooperative States was last updated on February 16, 2024 and currently includes the United States Virgin Islands, the American Samoa, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Fiji, Guam, Palau, Panama, Russia, Samoa, Seychelles, Trinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu, Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands. States only referred to in Article 238-0 A 2 bis 2°, and thus outside of the scope of Article 125 A III of the FTC, currently are Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Fiji, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, Palau, Panama, Russia, the American Samoa, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago. Furthermore, according to the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 238 A of the FTC, interest and assimilated revenues with respect to the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account held in a financial institution established in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and assimilated revenues may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC, in which case they may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC, at (i) the 25% standard corporate income tax rate set forth in the first sentence of the second paragraph of Article 219I of the FTC for payments benefiting legal persons which are not French tax residents, (ii) a rate of 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents or (iii) a rate of 75% for payments made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the FTC (in each case subject to certain exceptions and to more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC nor, to the extent that the relevant interest and assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the related withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC that may be levied as a result of such Deductibility Exclusion will apply in respect of the Notes if the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes was not that of locating the interest and assimilated revenues in a NonCooperative State (the “Exception”).

Considering that: (i) as of the date of their admission to trading, the Notes will be admitted to trading on Euronext Dublin in the Republic of Ireland which does not qualify as a NonCooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator which is not located in a NonCooperative State and/or (ii) the Notes will be admitted, at the time of their issue, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment systems operators within the meaning of Article L. 561-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code which is not located in a Non-Cooperative State, payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders will fall under the Safe Harbor and will thus not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC, as construed by the French tax authorities under the BOFIP. Moreover, under the same conditions, pursuant to the BOFIP and to the extent that the relevant interest and other assimilated revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and assimilated revenues paid by the Issuer on the Notes should not be subject to the Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, should not be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC solely on account of their being paid on an account held in a financial institution established in a Non-Cooperative State or accrued or paid to persons established or domiciled in a Non-Cooperative State.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended, in particular by Regulation (EU) 2018/946 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018, published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on July 6, 2018 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”) was published in the Official Gazette of the European Union on June 5, 2015 and applies to insolvencies which commenced after 26 June 2017 (subject to certain exceptions). The EU Insolvency Regulation applies within the European Union (other than Denmark), to public collective insolvency proceedings as defined therein and listed in its Annex A. It provides that the courts of the Member State in which a debtor’s “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings relating to such debtor. The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 4 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, a court requested to open insolvency proceedings is required to examine whether it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 3 and, pursuant to Article 5, such decision may be challenged by the debtor or any creditor on grounds of international jurisdiction. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the center of main interests, or “COMI” of a “debtor shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. It sets forth, as explained by Recital (30), a rebuttable presumption that a debtor has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption shall only apply if the registered office of the legal person has not been moved to another Member State within the 3-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital (30) provides that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EU insolvency regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, the courts have considered a number of factors in determining a debtor’s COMI, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts most of its business or has its head office and the location where most of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. ----- If a debtor’s COMI is and will remain located in the Member State (other than Denmark) in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If a debtor’s COMI is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State or had an establishment in such EU Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where the debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to commence main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. When main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment shall be secondary insolvency proceedings. The effects of such secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. When main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, pursuant to Article 3 (4) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main, secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus (i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor). Furthermore, pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The commencement of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: (a) the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; (b) the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; (c) the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and (d) a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. ----- The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. Pursuant to Article 21 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State that has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is located there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. However, under Article 36 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings may attempt to avoid the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State by giving a unilateral undertaking in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened that the distribution of those assets or of the proceeds received as a result of their realization, will comply with the distribution and priority rights that would apply under the relevant national law if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in such other Member State. Such undertaking must be made in writing and is subject to approval by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the insolvency estate and if a court is requested to open secondary insolvency proceedings, it shall, at the request of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, refuse to open such proceedings if it is satisfied that the undertaking adequately protects the general interests of local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a debtor and its creditors, the court, at the request of the debtor or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. When the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: (a) for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and courts; (b) for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; (c) that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and (d) that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The EU Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (a) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (b) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (c) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (d) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. In order to be adopted the plan will have to be confirmed by a judicial or administrative authority that will in particular ensure the protection of each type of creditors’ rights and compliance with the priority rules governing the adoption of the plan. The transposition of the EU Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new financing and interim financing and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of a restructuring. In order to transpose the EU Restructuring Directive into French law, the French government issued: (a) on September 15, 2021, ordinance no. 2021-1193 (the “2021 Ordinance”), effective as from October 1[st], 2021 in respect only (with limited exceptions) of preventive and insolvency proceedings opened as of such date; and (b) on September 23, 2021, decree no. 2021-1218 (the “2021 Decree”) for the implementation of the 2021 Ordinance.

In addition, to the extent that (i) its COMI is deemed to be in France or it has an establishment in France or, (ii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, its registered office or its main center of interests within the meaning of Article R. 600-1 of the French Commercial Code, is deemed to be in France, it could also be subject to French court-administered proceedings affecting creditors, i.e., either safeguard proceedings and accelerated safeguard proceedings (sauvegarde and sauvegarde accélérée), judicial reorganization proceedings (redressement _judiciaire) or judicial liquidation proceedings (liquidation _judiciaire)._ Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation lists safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings as insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Any company of our Group having its COMI in France could be subject to French main insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation and any company of our Group having an establishment in France and its COMI in another EU Member State (other than Denmark) could be subject to French secondary insolvency proceedings within the meaning of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation also lists accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as insolvency proceedings but accelerated financial safeguard proceedings no longer have a separate existence under French law as they have been merged into accelerated safeguard proceedings as of October 1[st], 2021 (save for proceedings commenced before this date) by the 2021 Ordinance. Specialized courts exist for (i) conciliation or court-administered proceedings with respect to debtors that meet or exceed (on a stand-alone basis or together with the companies under their control) (x) 20 million euros in net turnover and 250 employees or (y) 40 million euros in net turnover, (ii) commencement of proceedings with respect to which the court’s international jurisdiction results from the application of the EU Insolvency Regulation or (iii) in cases where the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply, from the debtor having its main center of interests within the jurisdiction of such specialized courts. In addition, the French court that commences preventive or insolvency proceedings with respect to the member of a corporate group has jurisdiction over all the other members of the group (subject to French courts having international jurisdiction with respect to such entities, in accordance with the rules outlined above and to specific control thresholds). Accordingly, a court can supervise the insolvency proceedings of the whole group and may, for this purpose, appoint the same administrator (administrateur judiciaire) and creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire) for all proceedings in respect of members of the group. In general, French insolvency legislation favors the continuation of a business and protection of employment over the payment of creditors and could limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes or the Guarantees granted by the French Guarantors and corresponding security interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

A court order made under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code will suspend any pending enforcement measures, and any contractual default interest or penalty for late payment will not accrue or be due during the grace periods ordered by the relevant judge. If the debtor is engaged in conciliation proceedings or has reached a conciliation agreement that is in the course of being executed, special rules apply to the grant of grace periods (see section “Court-Assisted Proceedings” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The date of insolvency (état de cessation des paiements) is generally deemed to be the date of the court order commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be carried back up to 18 months before the date of such court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings. The date of insolvency marks the beginning of the hardening period (see section “Hardening Period” below).",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In practice, mandat ad hoc proceedings are used by debtors that are facing any type of difficulties but are not_ insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). The proceedings are informal and confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the President of the court’s order appointing the mandataire ad hoc to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed officer (mandataire ad hoc),_ whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings are not limited in time. The duties of the mandataire ad hoc are determined by the president of the competent court that appoints him or her, usually to facilitate negotiations with creditors. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Mandat ad hoc proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually also accept to abstain from such action while they are ongoing. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above). The agreement reached is reported to the president of the court but is not formally approved by it. ----- Conciliation_ proceedings may only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above) or has not been insolvent for more than 45 calendar days. The proceedings are confidential by law (save for the disclosure of the President of the court’s order commencing the proceedings to the statutory auditors, if any). They are carried out under the aegis of a court-appointed conciliator (conciliateur), whose name may be suggested by the debtor itself, under the supervision of the president of the court. The proceedings may last up to five months (after an initial period of a maximum of four months, upon request of the conciliator, the president of the competent court may extend the conciliation period up to the absolute maximum of five months). In case the debtor intends to have the conciliation agreement approved (homologué) or acknowledged (constaté), its request must be filed by the end of this five-month period, even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. The duties of the conciliator are to assist the debtor in negotiating an agreement with all or part of its creditors and/or other stakeholders that puts an end to its difficulties, e.g., providing for the restructuring of its indebtedness. Any agreement between the debtor and its creditors/stakeholders will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. Conciliation proceedings do not automatically stay any pending proceedings and creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the debtor to recover their claims but those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so for their duration. Creditors may not request the opening of insolvency proceedings (judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings) against the debtor for the duration of the conciliation proceedings. Pursuant to Article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code, during the proceedings, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced them for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see section “Grace periods” above) if a creditor has formally put the debtor on notice to pay, is suing for payment, or does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request to stay payment of its claim. In the latter case, the judge may, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, order the postponement or the rescheduling of the creditor’s claims that have not yet fallen due. A joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from grace periods so granted by the judge. The conciliation agreement reached between the parties may be acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the Commercial Court at the request of the parties, which makes the agreement enforceable without further recourse to a judge (force exécutoire), but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. Alternatively, the conciliation agreement may be approved (homologué) by the Commercial Court at the request of the debtor - following a hearing held for that purpose to which the works council or employee representatives, as the case may be, must be convened – if: (a) the debtor is not insolvent or the conciliation agreement has the effect of putting an end to the debtor’s insolvency; (b) the terms of the conciliation agreement ensure the continuation of the business as a going-concern; and (c) the conciliation agreement does not impair the rights of the non-signatory creditors. Such approval will have the same effect as its acknowledgment (constatation) as described above and, in addition: (a) the decision of approval by the relevant civil or commercial court, which should only disclose the amount of any Conciliation Lien (see below) and the guarantees and security interests granted to ----- secure the same, will be public but the agreement itself should otherwise remain confidential except vis-à-vis the works council or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court; (b) persons that, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the debtor (other than shareholders providing new equity in the context of a capital increase) will enjoy a priority of payment over all pre-commencement and post-commencement claims (subject to certain exceptions including with respect to certain pre-commencement or post-commencement employment claims and procedural costs) (the “Conciliation Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; (c) in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, the claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien may not, without their holders’ consent, be rescheduled or written off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted), not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed); (d) when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; and (e) in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of occurrence of the insolvency (see section “Insolvency test” above), and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below – see section “Hardening Period” below), cannot be set by the court as of a date earlier than the date of the approval (homologation) of the agreement by the court (except in case of fraud). Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) may, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliator to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution_ and, while the agreement is in force: (a) interest accruing on the claims that are the subject to the conciliation agreement may not be compounded; (b) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the debtor retains the right to petition the judge that commenced the conciliation proceedings to impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement and, taking into account the conditions of its performance; and (c) in accordance with Article L. 611-10-2 of the French Commercial Code, a joint-debtor and a third party that had previously granted credit support (a guarantee or security interest) with respect to the debtor’s obligations may benefit from the provisions of the conciliation agreement as well as from grace periods granted to the debtor during the execution of the conciliation agreement pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code mentioned above. If the debtor breaches the terms of the conciliation agreement, any party to it may petition the president of the court or the court (depending on whether the agreement was acknowledged or approved) for its termination. Termination will however not extend to the provisions of the conciliation agreement ----- addressing the consequences of such termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may also be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to obtaining payment of the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent safeguard or insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims (decreased by potential recoveries made) and pre-existing security interests or guarantees. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor’s business, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” a.k.a. a prepack sale plan (plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. Provided they comply with certain requirements, offers received in this context by the _mandataire ad hoc_ or the conciliator may, after consultation of the public prosecutor, be considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtor’s rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a _mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of_ the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to court-assisted proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not, in and of itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before 3 months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

As a result and for the sake of clarity, standard safeguard proceedings will be presented below before accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1138,CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS,1138.3,France,1138.3.6,Standard Safeguard Proceedings,"A debtor that experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde) with respect to itself, provided that it is not insolvent (see section “Insolvency test” above). Creditors of the debtor are not notified of, nor invited to attend the hearing before the court at which the commencement of safeguard proceedings is requested even if they have a limited right to challenge the court decision commencing the proceedings. Following the commencement of safeguard proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is appointed (except for small companies where the court considers that such appointment is not necessary) to investigate the business of the debtor during an “observation period” (being the period starting on the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings and ending on the date on which the court takes a decision on the outcome of the proceedings), which may last up to 12 months. The role of the court-appointed administrator is also to assist the debtor in preparing a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) that it will circularize to its creditors (or submit to the classes of affected ----- parties – see below) that may include a partial sale of the business. Creditors or equity holders do not have effective control over the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the debtor assisted by the court-appointed administrator. The court-appointed administrator will, in accordance with the terms of the judgment appointing him or her, exercise ex post facto control over decisions made by the debtor (mission de surveillance) or assist the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (mission _d’assistance), all under the supervision of the court. A supervisory judge (juge-commissaire) and a_ creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) are also appointed at the beginning of the proceedings, alongside the court-appointed administrator. Management decisions in respect of disposals (acte de _disposition) that fall outside the scope of the ordinary course of business, as well as decisions_ considered to be important under statute, require the prior approval of the supervisory judge (e.g., granting security interests or settling disputes). The supervisory judge can appoint 1 to 5 controllers (contrôleurs) among the creditors who have filed a request, provided they meet certain conditions (in particular no affiliation to the debtor). Controllers assist the creditors’ representative in his functions and the supervisory judge in his duty of supervising the progress of the insolvency proceedings. In order to protect creditors’ interests and under certain conditions, the controllers may act in the interests of the creditors when the creditors’ representative fails to take sufficient action. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de _cessation des paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed_ administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, pursuant to Article L. 622-10 of the French Commercial Code, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or, (b) if, no plan has been adopted, the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the debtor would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases except in the case of (i)(b), the court may decide the conversion at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor or on its own initiative. In the case of the situation described in (i) (b) above, the court cannot act upon its own initiative and would decide the conversion at the request of the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor if no draft plan was approved by the relevant classes of Affected Parties. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court appointed administrator, the creditors representative, the creditors of the debtor appointed by the supervisory judge as controller (“Contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. _Judicial Restructuring Lien: Persons that, in the context of accelerated safeguard, safeguard, judicial_ reorganization or liquidation proceedings, provide new money (except through a share capital increase) (the “Judicial Restructuring Lien”): (a) during the observation period in safeguard and judicial reorganization proceedings or the temporary continuation of business operations in judicial liquidation proceedings, in order to ensure the continuity of the debtor’s business during this period, in which case such financing must be authorized by the supervisory judge and are subject to publicity, or ----- (b) for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan (including a plan ordered by the court that substantially modifies a previous one), in which case the amount and the privilege must be specifically mentioned in the draft plan on which the affected parties are called upon to vote as well as in the court decision adopting the plan, enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and post-commencement claims with the exception of (i) employees’ super-privileged claims, (ii) procedural costs, (iii) the Conciliation Lien (iv) pre-commencement claims secured by security interests over real estate assets (only in the context of judicial liquidation proceedings) and (v) post-commencement wages claims not advanced through the French wages guarantee scheme (AGS) under provisions of Articles L. 3253-8 to L. 3253-13 of the French Labor Code. The Judicial Restructuring Lien may not, directly or indirectly, secure any financing provided prior to commencement of the proceedings. In addition, such claims may not be rescheduled or written-off by a safeguard or a reorganization plan (although such claims will not be paid before the safeguard or reorganization plan is adopted) without the consent of the relevant creditors, not even through a cram-down or a cross-class cram-down (in the event that classes of affected parties are formed), in the on-going or in subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. Creditors (and if applicable, equity holders) must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt write-offs, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court. The rules governing consultation will vary depending on the size of the business. _Standard consultation: this applies in respect of debtors that, on the date of the petition for_ commencement of the proceedings (on a stand-alone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) have less than (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover unless, upon their request, the supervisory judge authorizes a class-based consultation of their creditors (see below). In such case, the court-appointed administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the creditors representative, who seeks the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt write-offs and payment schedules proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, _provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the creditors_ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the length of the plan (ten years maximum except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors that do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt-for-equity-swap) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. ----- Within the framework of a standard consultation, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de _sauvegarde) can impose a uniform rescheduling of the claims of creditors having refused the proposals_ that were submitted to them (subject to exceptions such as the ones applicable to claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien) over a maximum period of ten years (except for agricultural businesses where the maximum is fifteen years and for claims with maturity dates falling after the term of the plan, in which case the maturity dates shall remain the same), but no write-off of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance. Following a court imposed rescheduling, the first payment must be made within a year of the judgment adopting the plan (in the third and subsequent years, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 5% of the amount of each debt claim and, as from the sixth year, the amount of each annual instalment must be of at least 10% (except for agricultural businesses)) or on the first payment date following the initial maturity of the claim if such date is later than the first payment date provided for in the plan, in which case the amount of such first payment is equal to what the creditor would have received had he been paid in accordance with the uniform payment rescheduling applying to the other creditors. If the draft plan provides for a modification of the share capital or the by-laws, the court may decide that the shareholders general meeting and, as the case may be, the general meetings of the holders of securities giving access to the share capital of the company shall vote, the first time the relevant meeting is convened, at a simple majority of the votes of the shareholders attending, or represented at, the meeting, provided that they hold at least half of the shares with voting rights. The second time the meeting is convened, the usual provisions relating to quorum and majority shall apply. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). If the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without the court’s consent. The plan adopted by the court may be modified during its implementation. However, when the modification is substantial and relates to the terms and conditions of the discharge of liabilities, the interested parties are consulted by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt sent by the court clerk. Such interested parties shall answer to this consultation no later than 21 calendar days following the receipt. Failure to respond shall constitute acceptance of the proposed changes, except if they relate to debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. _Class-based consultation: This applies to companies that, on the date of the petition for commencement_ of the proceedings, meet or exceed either of the following thresholds (x) 250 employees and € 20 million in net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover (on a standalone basis or together with other entities that they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code), or upon the debtor’s request and with the authorization of the supervisory judge if they do not meet such thresholds. The consultation involves the submission of a proposed safeguard plan prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the court-appointed judicial administrator for consideration by the affected parties (parties _affectées), as defined below._ Only the affected parties are entitled to vote on the draft plan. Pursuant to Article L. 626-30 of the French Commercial Code, affected parties are: (a) creditors whose rights are directly impaired by the proposed plan; ----- (b) equity holders (including shareholders and holders of securities giving future rights to the share capital) if their equity interests, the debtor’s articles of association or by-laws, or their rights are modified by the proposed plan. Please note that a decision of the Versailles Court of Appeals, 22 June 2023, no 23/03276 in the Orpea matter, ruled that holders of notes giving future access to the share capital (such as notes convertible into shares) are deemed to be creditors for the purposes of the proceedings if they have not converted their bonds into equity by the date of the commencement of the proceedings. The court-appointed administrator is responsible for drawing up the classes and informing each affected party that it is a member of a class. The court-appointed administrator must, on the basis of objective verifiable criteria, allocate the affected parties in classes presenting a sufficient commonality of economic interest (communauté d’intérêt économique suffisante) in compliance with the following conditions: (a) creditors whose claims are secured by security interests in rem (sûretés réelles), in respect of their claims so secured, and other creditors shall belong to different classes; (b) the class formation shall comply with subordination agreements entered into before commencement of the proceedings that shall have been brought to the attention of the court-appointed administrator within ten days from his notification to each affected party of its membership in a class; (c) equity holders shall make up one or more classes; and (d) claims arising from employment contracts (including the French wage guarantee scheme (AGS) claims), pension rights, and maintenance claims cannot be affected by the plan and in respect of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor, only the amount of their claims that are not secured by such security trust is taken into account. The court-appointed administrator shall notify to each affected party the criteria for class formation and for the determination of the voting rights corresponding to the affected claims or rights allowing them to cast a vote. The amount of the claims taken into consideration is the one communicated by the debtor and certified by its auditor(s) or, failing that, endorsed by a certificate from its chartered certified accountant. Future interest claims calculated by a reference to an index are calculated by reference to the value of the index at the date of the court decision commencing the proceedings. The claims of creditors secured by a security trust (fiducie) shall only be taken into account for the portion of their claim not secured by the security trust. Any affected party, the debtor, the public prosecutor, the creditors representative or the court-appointed administrator is entitled, within ten days following the notification of the criteria for the formation of the classes and the determination of the voting rights referred to in the preceding paragraph, to dispute the same before the supervisory judge. The supervisory judge must rule within ten days of the referral date, and failing that, any aforementioned person may refer the dispute to the court, which must rule within ten days of such later referral date. The supervisory judge’s decision (or the court’s decision, as the case may be) may be appealed within five days of its notification to the parties. The proposed plan may, inter alia, include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and/or debt-for-equity swaps (subject to specific exceptions, including in respect of claims benefiting from the Conciliation Lien or the Judicial Restructuring Lien). The procedures for convening the affected parties and organizing their vote vary according to the parties concerned (creditors, bondholders, equity holders) and are ultimately determined by the court-appointed judicial administrator within certain guidelines set by the 2021 Decree. ----- The classes must approve or reject the plan within 20 to 30 days of its submission. The period may be extended or shortened by the supervisory judge, upon prior request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator, but may not be shorter than 15 days. The decision shall be taken by each class by a two-thirds majority of the votes held by the members casting a vote. If applicable, the class or classes of equity holders vote under the rules governing votes at shareholders/equity holders’ general meetings, except that the decision is taken at the same two-thirds majority. Within a class, the vote on the adoption of the plan may be replaced by an agreement which, after consultation with its members, has received the approval of two-thirds of the voting rights. Once the draft plan has been adopted by each of the classes, it will be submitted to the commercial court which shall essentially verify that the following conditions are met: (a) the classes have been duly formed in accordance with the rules mentioned above; (b) affected parties, sharing a sufficient commonality of interest within the same class, are treated equally and in proportion to their claim or right; (c) the plan has been duly notified to all the affected parties; (d) if there are dissenting affected parties, the plan meets the “best interests of creditors” test (i.e., no dissenting party is worse off as a result of the plan than it would be if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)) or in the event of a better alternative solution if the plan was not approved); (e) where applicable, any new financing is necessary to implement the plan and does not excessively impair the interests of the affected parties; and (f) the interests of all affected parties are sufficiently protected. The court may refuse to adopt the plan if it does not offer a reasonable prospect of avoiding the debtor’s insolvency or of ensuring the viability of the business. The judgment adopting the plan renders the plan enforceable against all (erga omnes) (including the affected parties who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan). As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the plan provides for a share capital increase, the shareholders may pay up their subscription to such share capital increase by way of a set-off against their admitted claims against the debtor (as such claims may be reduced according to the provisions of the plan). Cross-class cram-down: The 2021 Ordinance has introduced a_ cross-class cram-down mechanism into French law: where the safeguard plan is not approved by a two-thirds majority of each class, it may be adopted by the court at the request of the debtor or the court-appointed administrator (with the approval of the debtor) and be imposed on the classes of affected parties that voted against the plan provided that: (a) the plan complies with the conditions for adoption of the plan by the court mentioned above; ----- (b) the plan has been approved by: (i) a majority of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, provided that at least one such class is a class of creditors whose claims are secured by security interests _in rem (sûretés _réelles) or is senior to the unsecured creditors class (créanciers chirographaires); or, if such_ condition is not met, (ii) at least one of the classes of affected parties entitled to vote, other than an equity holders’ class or any other class which, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, could reasonably be expected not to be entitled to any payment if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); (c) the claims held by a dissenting class of affected parties are fully paid (by identical or equivalent means) if a lower ranking class is entitled to be paid or retains an interest within the plan (i.e., absolute priority rule); (d) no class of affected parties receives or retains, under the plan, more than the total amount of its claims or interests; (e) where one or more classes of equity holders have been constituted and have not approved the plan, the plan can be imposed on such dissenting equity holders if: (i) the debtor (on a standalone basis or together with other entities which they hold or control, within the meaning of Articles L. 233-1 and L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code) meets or exceeds either of the following thresholds: (x) 250 employees and 20 million euros of net turnover or (y) € 40 million in net turnover; (ii) it is reasonably foreseeable, after determining the value of the debtor as a going concern, that the equity holders of the dissenting class or classes would not be entitled to any payment or retain any interest if the order of priority of payments in a judicial liquidation were applied (whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession)); (iii) if the plan provides for a capital increase to be paid up by cash contribution or by way of set off of claims, the shares issued are offered by preference to the shareholders, pro rata their shareholding; and (iv) the plan does not provide for the transfer of all or part of the rights of the dissenting class or classes of equity holders, The court’s decision constitutes approval of the changes to the shareholding structure, to the rights of the equity holders, to the articles of association or the by-laws provided for in the plan. The court may appoint a judicial representative to perform the acts necessary for the implementation of these changes. Upon request from the debtor, or from the court-appointed administrator with the debtor’s consent, the court can override the absolute priority rule if it is deemed necessary to achieve the plan’s objectives and if the plan does not excessively affect the rights or interests of affected parties. In particular, supplier claims, equity holders and tort liability claims may benefit from such exemption. ----- As for plans adopted through a standard consultation, if the court adopts a safeguard plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be disposed of without court’s consent. If no proposed safeguard plan is adopted by the classes of affected parties, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the _mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly lead the debtor to shortly becoming insolvent. At the latest within ten days from the vote of the classes on the draft plan, any affected party having voted against the draft plan and considering that (a) the best interest test criterion has not been met; or (b) in the event of a plan adopted by a cross-class cram-down and, based on the valuation of the debtor as a going concern, either (or both) of the following conditions has not been met: (i) in the event that the plan was approved solely by the vote of an affected class that was not an equity holder, such class would not have been entitled to a payment if the order of payment in a judicial liquidation were applied whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, a court-ordered sale plan; (ii) in the event that a class, or classes, of equity holders voted against the plan, such class(es) would not have received a payment or retained an interest in the event that the order of payment applicable in a judicial liquidation were applied whether in the event of a piecemeal sale or, of a court-ordered sale plan, may petition the court to dispute the same. Following a hearing and after receiving the public prosecutor’s opinion, the court will, in the same decision, determine the value of the debtor (in respect of which the court is entitled to order the appointment of an expert) and rule on compliance with the aforementioned conditions and on the adoption of the plan. This decision may itself be challenged within ten days of its notification or communication to them, by the affected party(ies) that initially challenged the class vote, the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative or the public prosecutor. In the event no safeguard plan is adopted through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down), there is no statute that allows French courts to impose a term-out (i.e., a rescheduling over a maximum period of 10 years of the indebtedness of dissenting creditors) although the courts retain this power under statute if the plan is adopted under the standard consultation procedure (i.e., if no classes are formed and, in judicial reorganization proceedings, in case of failure of the class-based consultation (see section “Court-administered Proceedings—Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)). _Specific case - Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social_ security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt write-offs under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible debt write-offs within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission ----- _des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax authorities may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards_ indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines. Where the plan provides for debt write-offs or rescheduling affecting secured public creditors’ claims, the administrator can decide to gather those public creditors within a class (or classes) of affected parties called upon to vote on the proposed plan.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: (a) its financial statements must have been certified by an auditor (commissaire aux comptes) or drawn-up by a chartered certified accountant (expert-comptable); (b) the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; (c) the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern that is likely to be supported by enough of the parties that will be impaired to render its adoption plausible within an initial two-month period, that may be extended up to a total maximum of four months, following commencement of the accelerated safeguard proceedings, upon request from the debtor and the court-appointed administrator; and (d) the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applied for commencement of conciliation proceedings. The debtor may request the limitation of the scope of the accelerated safeguard proceedings to its financial creditors only, if the nature of its indebtedness is such that a plan could be adopted by such creditors alone. If the debtor does not meet the thresholds above that require creditor classes (see above) to be formed, the court must order such formation in the decision commencing the proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings. However, certain provisions relating to ongoing contracts and the provisions relating to the recovery of assets by their owners do not apply in accelerated safeguard proceedings. The plan, in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings, is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings (with class-based consultation) and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor. If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court shall terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the class process and, in particular, cannot impose a term-out. The list of claims of affected parties, party to the conciliation proceedings, established by the debtor and certified by the statutory auditor or the chartered-accountant, shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings unless the affected parties otherwise elect to make such ----- a filing (see section “Status of Creditors during Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard, Judicial _Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation Proceedings” below)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above). _De jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings that it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), a controller, the public prosecutor or upon its own initiative, the court may convert the judicial reorganization proceedings into judicial liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor’s recovery is manifestly impossible. The court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative, the controllers, the public prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months (instead of a maximum of 12 months under safeguard proceedings), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor to elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan and may include a partial sale of the business), the partial or total sale of the business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission _d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor_ (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. Differences exist under judicial reorganization proceedings in respect of class formation and the adoption of the restructuring plan. The main differences are as follows: (a) if the debtor does not meet the required threshold(s) the authorization to form classes of affected parties may also be requested from the supervisory judge by the court-appointed administrator on their own, without the debtor’s approval (in addition to being requested by the debtor); ----- (b) any affected party may submit a draft plan to the vote of the classes. The draft plan shall be submitted, together with the plan proposed by the debtor, at the latest 15 days before the date of the vote; (c) if the draft reorganization plan or the plan provides for a change in the equity structure or share transfers, prior approval clauses (clauses d’agrément) are deemed null and void. (d) if the plan has not been approved by all classes of affected parties, the court can decide to apply the cross-class cram-down mechanism at the request of any affected party (in addition to the debtor or the administrator with the debtor’s consent); and (e) in the event that plan approval through the class-based consultation procedure (whether by regular approval by the classes of affected parties or by a cross-class cram-down) fails the approval of the plan may occur through the standard consultation rules (see above). In relation to equity holders, the following is also to be noted in the event of judicial reorganization proceedings: (a) in case a shareholders meeting needs to vote to bring the shareholders equity to a level equal to at least one-half of the share capital as required by Article L. 626-3 of the French Commercial Code, the court-appointed administrator may request the appointment a court officer (mandataire _de justice) to convene a shareholders meeting and to vote the restoration of the shareholders’_ equity up to the amount proposed by the court-appointed administrator on behalf of the shareholders that refuse to vote in favor of such a resolution if the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity to the benefit of a third party(ies) undertaking to comply with the reorganization plan; (b) if (a) the debtor company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls (within the meaning of the French Labor Code) one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (b) the disappearance of the debtor company is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and to local employment, (c) the modification of the debtor company’s share capital appears to be the only credible way to avoid harm to the national or regional economy and to allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, then, at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the public prosecutor (x) after the review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and (y) if at least 3 months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the debtor company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either: (i) appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan; or (ii) order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking minority in the debtor company’s shareholders meetings, any consent clause being deemed unwritten; the other shareholders have the right to withdraw from the debtor company and request that their shares be purchased simultaneously by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by an expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. ----- In either of the above cases, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court that may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the proposed reorganization plans are manifestly unlikely to ensure that the debtor will recover or if no reorganization plan is proposed, the court upon the request of the administrator, can order the total or partial sale of the business as part of a court-ordered sale plan (plan de cession). At any time during the observation period, the court may, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order a partial cessation of activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its reorganization is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in judicial liquidation proceedings nor does the law limit their duration (except with respect to simplified judicial liquidation proceedings). The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes, both of which are decided by the court without a vote of the creditors: (a) a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is usually at a significant discount compared to their going-concern market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan that ensures the continuation of the business as a going-concern and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: (a) a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan, provided that such creditors have regularly filed their claims; (b) the purchaser will be able to exercise the purchase option under a financial lease only if the outstanding amounts under such lease are repaid (but within the limit of the value of the leased asset as set by agreement between the parties or, failing such agreement, by the court); and ----- (c) only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent its sale) until they are repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless an agreement is reached with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their going-concern market value; or (a) separate sales of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: (i) launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); (ii) sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received, (the formal authorization of the supervisory judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or (iii) request, under the supervision of the supervisory judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court orders a sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. The court will end the judicial liquidation proceedings when either: (a) no due liabilities remain or the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du _passif); or_ (b) continuation of the liquidation operations becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: (a) when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; or (b) in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors in full, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from_ these lawsuits between the remaining creditors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Also, except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). The insolvency date is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions entered into during the hardening period are automatically void or voidable by the court. Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration or for a nominal consideration, contracts under which the obligations of the debtor significantly exceed the reciprocal obligations of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments of debts that are due made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposits of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as bond or as a precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred (unless they replace a previous security interest of at least an equivalent nature and base and with the exception of the assignment of a professional receivables (Dailly assignment) made in execution of a framework agreement entered into prior to the date of insolvency), provisional attachment or seizure measures (mesures conservatoires) (unless the attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as security for a debt simultaneously incurred), any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that affects assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment, and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code. Transactions that are voidable by the court include payments made on debts that are due, transactions for consideration, administrative seizure measures, notices of attachments made to third parties (avis _à tiers détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, in_ each case if the court determines that the party dealing with the debtor knew that the debtor was insolvent at the relevant time. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité) pursuant to Article L. 526-1 of the French Commercial Code are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. Unlike automatically void transactions, which must be set aside by the court if so requested, the court has discretion to decide whether or not it is appropriate to set aside transactions that are only “voidable”. There is no hardening period prior to safeguard proceedings or to accelerated safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions _of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of judicial reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the_ French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, no. 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard or accelerated safeguard proceedings). However, except in accelerated safeguard proceedings and judicial liquidation proceedings where the continued operation of the business has not been ordered by the court, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) that it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. ----- Conversely, the court-appointed administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a sale plan (plan de cession) as described above. In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision ordering the sale plan, as described above, or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: (a) accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment that is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); (b) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions, which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the supervisory judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets (whether they be pledged, retained by a creditor based on a retention right or constitute collateral in a security trust estate (patrimoine fiduciaire) required by the continued operation of the business) or to pay a carrier requesting payment directly from the debtor; (c) the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; security interests can be granted as regards such debts the payment of which is not prohibited, subject to prior authorization by the supervisory judge; (d) debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; (e) creditors (or beneficiaries of a third party security granted by the debtor) may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or against a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: (i) to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); (ii) to terminate a contract for nonpayment of amounts owed to the creditor; or (iii) to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, including if such assets secure third party debt, except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such ----- asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings commenced in France, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation (subject to secondary proceedings that may be commenced in such Member State). Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France and the EU would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party); and (f) any increase to the base of a contractual security interest or a contractual retention right: (by any means whatsoever, by adding or supplementing assets or rights, in particular by registration of securities or proceeds supplementing the securities registered in a pledged securities account) is prohibited; any contrary provision, in particular relating to the transfer of future assets or rights of the debtor not yet in existence on the date of the judgment commencing the proceedings, will be held unenforceable as from the date of commencement of the proceedings; by exception, the increase in the base of a contractual security interest may however validly result from an assignment of professional receivables (Dailly assignment) pursuant to a master agreement entered into before commencement of the proceedings or from other specific contrary provisions of the French Commercial Code regarding restructuring and insolvency, the French Monetary and Financial Code or the French Insurance Code; and (g) in the context of reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrat en cours), will be required. A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan or of a judicial reorganization plan adopted by the court. In accelerated safeguard proceedings, the above rules would only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). Debts owed to creditors that are not within the scope of the proceedings continue to be payable in the ordinary course of business. As a general rule, creditors domiciled in metropolitan France whose claims arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court-appointed creditors representative within two months of the publication of the court decision in the relevant official gazette (Bulletin Officiel _des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales); this period is extended to four months for creditors domiciled_ outside metropolitan France. Creditors must also file a claim for the post-commencement non-privileged debts, with respect to which the two or four month period referred to above starts to run as from their maturity date. Creditors whose claims have not been submitted during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in connection with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferred creditors under French law. In addition, the holder of a security interest in rem granted by the debtor to secure the debt of a third party must also file a statement of claim with the creditors representative under the same conditions. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the supervisory judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. ----- In accelerated safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or chartered certified accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings must file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court orders a sale plan (plan de cession) of the debtor in judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings (see above), the proceeds of the sale will be allocated towards the repayment of its creditors according to the ranking of the claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a Conciliation Lien or a Judicial Restructuring Lien (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and public creditors (i.e., taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority is not relevant to all creditors, for example creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset will be treated separately.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Limitations on Guarantees.","The liabilities and obligations of each French Guarantor are subject to: (a) certain exceptions, including to the extent of any obligations which would constitute prohibited financial assistance within the meaning of Article L. 225-216 of the French Commercial Code or infringement of the provisions of Articles L. 241-3, L. 242-6 or L. 244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and (b) French corporate benefit rules. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. ----- Under French corporate benefit rules, a guarantor must receive an actual and adequate benefit from the transaction involving the granting by it of the guarantee, taken as a whole. A court could declare any guarantee unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if it found that these criteria were not fulfilled. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to the guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. Accordingly, each of the guarantees by the French Guarantors and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on-lent by the Issuer, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously directly or indirectly on-lent, to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding on the date a payment is requested to be made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Guarantees in respect of the obligations of any other obligor shall reduce _pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans due by such French Guarantor or its subsidiaries under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. By virtue of this limitation, a French Guarantor’s obligation under the Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a French Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantees. In addition, if a French Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such French Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s-length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes and the Guarantees if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, it should be noted that neither the Trustee nor the Security Agent shall have any obligation to take any steps or action to perfect any of these liens. In particular, pledges over the securities of French subsidiaries in the form a stock company (société par actions) that are governed by French law consist of pledges over a securities account (nantissement de compte _de titres financiers) in which the relevant securities are registered. The securities account pledges will_ be validly established after execution of a statement of pledge (déclaration de nantissement de compte _titres financiers) by each security provider in favor of the Security Agent. Each statement of pledge will_ have to be registered in the relevant shareholder’s account (compte d’actionnaire) and shares registry (registre de mouvement de titres) of each French Guarantor. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not publicly registered (such as pledges over securities account), with the result that no assurance can be given on the priority of a security interest if it is not publicly registered. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. The Security Agent will not monitor, nor can there be any assurance that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. The Security Agent has no obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or the perfection of any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Guarantees against third parties. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Under French law, pledges over securities (whether in the form of a pledge over securities account or in the form of a pledge over shareholding interests (parts sociales)) may generally be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) by way of a sale of the pledged securities in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (ii) by way of judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) or contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged securities to the secured creditors, following which the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged securities. If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial foreclosure or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditor may be required to pay the pledgor a cash amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the securities as so determined and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the Collateral. If the value of such securities is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such securities, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured in that respect. An enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through a public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Any such legal act may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (a) the debtor performed such act without an obligation to do so; (b) the relevant creditor or (in the case of the debtor’s insolvency proceedings) any creditor was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (c) at the time the legal act was performed, both the debtor and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of such debtor’s creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery (where the legal act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), no such knowledge of the counterparty is necessary). If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the grant of the security interests in the Collateral, or the granting of a Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Collateral or the granting of such Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act.

The Parallel Debt will at all times be in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations. Any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Notes. The pledges governed by French law will ----- directly secure the Parallel Debt, and may not directly secure the obligations under the Notes and the other indebtedness secured by the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent (even if they are in some instances direct beneficiaries of the security interests in the Collateral). There is one published decision of the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on Parallel Debt mechanisms (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 _Belvédère) relating to a bond documentation governed by New York law. Such a decision recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights (especially the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a Parallel Debt claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy _(ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not_ exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the Parallel Debt mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as a recognition by French courts of Parallel Debt structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by it is limited to the proof of claims. The French court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a Parallel Debt. It is also fair to say that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a Parallel Debt claim. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Security Agent as Parallel Debt Creditor under the Parallel Debt construction are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral. The holders of the Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent as the beneficiary of the Parallel Debt. The Trustee has certain assigned duties and rights under the Indenture that become particularly important following Defaults or Events of Default, and acts as trustee in a fiduciary capacity in the best interests of the holders of the Notes. The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. The Security Documents are granted to the benefit of _inter alia the Trustee. To the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to the benefit of the Trustee are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive on this basis any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the Collateral.

The Notes will be guaranteed by the Luxembourg Guarantor, which is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Accordingly, Luxembourg courts should have, in principle, jurisdiction to open “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) with respect to the Luxembourg Guarantor, as an entity having its registered office and central administration (administration centrale) and centre of main interests (“COMI”), as used in the EU Insolvency Regulation, in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, such proceedings to be governed by Luxembourg insolvency laws. According to article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, there is a rebuttable presumption that a company has its COMI in the jurisdiction in which it has its registered office if the registered office has not moved to another member state within 3 months prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. As a result, there is a rebuttable presumption that the COMI of the Luxembourg Guarantor is in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and consequently that any main insolvency proceedings would be opened by a Luxembourg court and be governed by Luxembourg law. However, the determination of where the Luxembourg Guarantor has its COMI is a question of fact, which may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the COMI of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and is ascertainable by third parties. In that respect, the courts have to take a number of factors into consideration. The place where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the large majority of the company’s creditors are established may all be relevant factors in the determination of the place where the company has its COMI. The point at which a company’s COMI is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency laws in Luxembourg. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (together referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against (i) if the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, entities which have their COMI or an establishment in Luxembourg (in the case of an establishment, in respect of secondary proceedings only and assuming that the COMI is located in a member state other than Denmark and Luxembourg) or (ii) in all other cases (except specific sector-related proceedings, such as in respect of credit institutions and insurers), entities which have their central administration in Luxembourg: - bankruptcy proceedings (“faillite”), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the Luxembourg courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the relevant company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (“cessation des paiements”) and (ii) has lost its creditworthiness (“ébranlement de crédit”). If a Luxembourg court finds that both of these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings ex officio. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company (except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors), and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets. In addition, the managers or directors of a Luxembourg company that ceases its payments (i.e. it is unable to pay its debts as they fall due with normal means of payment) ----- must within a month of them having become aware of the company’s cessation of payments, file a petition for bankruptcy (“faillite”) with the court clerk of the district court applicable to the company’s registered office. If the managers or directors fail to comply with such obligation, they may be held (i) liable towards the company or any third-parties for any loss suffered and (ii) criminally liable for simple bankruptcy (“banqueroute simple”) in accordance with article 574 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (“Code de commerce”); - Judicial reorganisation (“réorganisation judiciaire”) which aims to preserve the continuity of all or part of the assets or business of the company under court supervision can be achieved either via a mutual agreement, a collective agreement or a transfer by court order. In each case, the opening of proceedings may be initiated by the company (and, in case of transfer by court order, by a third party creditor or the public prosecutor) which will request the appointment of a delegate judge (“juge délégué”) and the company may temporarily suspend the performance of its payment obligations (sursis), including under the Guarantees; and - Out-of-court reorganization (“réorganisation par accord amiable”), the opening of which may be initiated by the company through negotiation with at least two of its creditors, in order to reorganize all or part of its assets and/or business. To achieve it, the company may request the appointment of a conciliator (conciliateur d’entreprises). Once and if the out-of-court reorganization agreement is certified by a Luxembourg court, such agreement becomes enforceable and the claw-back provisions will no longer apply, and will remain enforceable in the event of a subsequent bankruptcy (“faillite”). In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a reprieve from payments (“sursis de paiement”) or to put the Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (“liquidation judiciaire”). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce or of the Luxembourg Law on Commercial Companies. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow similar rules as those applicable to Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and any claims that are preferred under Luxembourg law. Preferential claims under Luxembourg law include, among others: - remuneration owed to employees; - social security contributions; - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg tax administration; and - value added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the tax administration. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured and unpreferred creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended, save as provided for in the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law. Save with respect to financial collateral arrangements falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law, Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the hardening period (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations a Luxembourg court may set the start of the hardening period at an earlier date. In particular: ----- - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, some specific transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for prior existing debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the hardening period (or the ten preceding days) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions entered into for consideration during the hardening period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were entered into with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; - pursuant to article 447 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, the bankruptcy receiver may challenge and initiate nullity actions against mortgages and privileges that have been granted either ten days prior to or after the date of the cessation of payments if more than 15 days have elapsed between the granting of the mortgage or privilege and its registration; and - pursuant to article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code, (action paulienne), the bankruptcy receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. In principle, a bankruptcy judgment rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts, except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial (such as employment agreements and powers of attorney). Such contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy judgment. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts in order to avoid the worsening of the financial condition of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue _vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy judgment provides for a period of time during which_ creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations with respect to the Notes. In addition, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy or reorganisation proceedings may be subject to the EU Insolvency Regulation. In particular, rights _in rem_ over assets located in another jurisdiction where the EU Insolvency Regulation is applicable will not be affected by the opening of insolvency proceedings, without prejudice however to the application of rules relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of legal acts detrimental to all the creditors (subject to the application of article 24 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law, as described below and article 16 of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides for favorable rules in respect of security interests over claims or financial instruments securing monetary claims (or claims for the delivery of financial instruments). Article 20 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments, as well as all enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening period (“période suspecte”), against third-parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons irrespective of any ----- bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation of composition with creditors, whether national or foreign, save in the case of fraud. Article 24 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg security grantor will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar in nature to a Luxembourg security interests falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law. If article 24 applies, Luxembourg hardening period rules are disapplied (save for in the case of fraud). Article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law provides that where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such arrangement is enforceable against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Subject to the below, the enforcement of security interests may be subject to formalities (including judicial or non-judicial consent) and may be time-consuming in the event that the enforcement takes place under judicial control or in the event of a legal dispute. Courts may condition the enforcement of a security interest upon evidence that the creditor has a final and undisputed claim triggering the enforcement of the security interest. The enforcement of security interests may be hindered by conflict of law and/or conflict of jurisdiction issues and must not breach any public policy provision and/or mandatory legal provisions.

Under the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A pledge over shares will be perfected once (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the pledged shares and (ii) registered in the relevant register held by the company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional registration in the relevant register of such company. A pledge or an assignment for security purposes granted over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the relevant pledge or the assignment agreement ----- is entered into. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or the assignment or if it did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge or the assignment, payments to the pledgor or assignor will constitute a valid discharge. In the case of a Luxembourg law receivables pledge or assignment for security purposes, where one or more debtors under the underlying receivables are domiciled in a country other than Luxembourg, the perfection requirements of the respective laws of the domiciles of such debtors would also need to be complied with. A bank account pledge must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. If the account bank has any pre-existing security interests and/or other rights (including any right of set-off) in respect of the relevant account, the acceptance of the account bank of the pledge and waiver of its higher ranking rights is required. If (future) bank accounts (opened with the same account bank) are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and acceptances occur, the pledges are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks or other third parties. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Financial Collateral Law sets out enforcement remedies available in relation to pledges upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to: - direct appropriation of the pledged assets (by the pledgee or a designated third party) at (i) a value determined (before or after the enforcement) in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) in the case of financial instruments which are listed on a stock market or another qualifying regulated market, their listing price; - sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at normal commercial terms (conditions _commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange or (iii) by way of a public_ auction; - attribution in court of the pledged assets in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. The timing of the enforcement will depend on the practical steps needed to enforce the security (e.g. the time of the negotiations in the case of a private sale). No legal proceedings are required in Luxembourg for most enforcement methods.",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

The Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold in France (other than to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés) as defined in, and in accordance with, Article 2(e) of the Prospectus Regulation and Article L.411-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier), and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any offering or marketing materials relating to the Notes may be made available or distributed in any way in France except to qualified investors. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, France and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit an offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase Notes in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Important Information” and “Notice to Investors”. The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We intend to list the Notes on the Official List of Euronext Dublin and to admit them for trading on the Global Exchange Market thereof; however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the Issue Date, which will be     business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is ----- referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle on the following business day unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next succeeding       business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or a person acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Manager may also over-allot the Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Manager may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading market for, the Notes. These stabilizing transactions and covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Stabilizing Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the Issue Date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, real estate assets valuation, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided, and may in the future provide, commercial lending, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees and expenses. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or its respective affiliates. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with us and may hedge their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. Moreover, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive allocations of the Notes. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers are also the mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Additionally, the Initial Purchasers are also acting as dealer managers in respect of the Tender Offer. Any offer or sale in the United States will be made by affiliates of the Initial Purchasers who are broker-dealers registered under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.1,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES France,28.1.1,,"The Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are entities organized under the laws of France with their registered offices or principal places of business in France (the “French Entities”). The directors, officers and other executives of the French Entities are neither residents nor citizens of the United States (the “French Individuals”). Furthermore, most of the assets of the French Entities or the French Individuals are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process upon such persons and entities, or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws within the United States. However, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process within France upon those persons or entities, provided that The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 is complied with. The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not parties to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal Judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non ex parte) proceedings if such U.S. Judgment is enforceable in the United States and if the French civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French civil court of the merits of the foreign judgment): (a) such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; (b) such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and (c) such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud under French law. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e. those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. ----- In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68 678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80 538 of July 16, 1980, Decree No. 2022-207 of February 18, 2022 and Order of the Ministry of Economy of March 7, 2022 (all relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad) or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene (i) French international public policy or (ii) overriding mandatory rules (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French Individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court. It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has recently held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts. Finally, please note that any document submitted as evidence by the parties which is not in the French language may be required to be translated into French for the purpose of any proceedings brought before a French court in respect thereof (although such translations do not need to be made before the relevant proceedings are commenced). -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624
303_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,28,INDEPENDENT AUDITORS,28.2,Luxembourg,28.2.1,,"The Luxembourg Guarantor is organized under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Most of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s assets are located outside the United States. Furthermore none of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s directors resides in the United States. As a result, investors may find it difficult to effect service of process within the United States upon the Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons or to enforce outside the United States judgments obtained against the Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons in U.S. courts, including judgments in actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. Likewise, it may also be difficult for an investor to enforce in U.S. courts judgments obtained against us or these persons in courts located in jurisdictions outside the United States, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. It may also be difficult for an investor to bring an original action in a Luxembourg court predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws against the Luxembourg Guarantor or these persons. It may be possible for investors to effect service of process within Luxembourg upon the Luxembourg Guarantor provided that the relevant provisions of The Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965 are complied with. As there is currently no treaty in force governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters between the United States and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, courts in Luxembourg will not automatically recognize and enforce a final judgment rendered by a U.S. court. A valid final, non-appealable and conclusive judgment against an issuer incorporated in Luxembourg with respect to the notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg, subject to compliance with the enforcement procedures (exequatur) set out in Article 678 _et seq. of the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procédure _Civile) and Luxembourg case-law, being:_ - the judgment of the U.S. court is enforceable (exécutoire) in the United States and must not contradict a judgment already enforceable in Luxembourg; - the assumption of jurisdiction (compétence) of the U.S. court is founded according to Luxembourg private international law rules; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural rules and has applied to the dispute the proper law designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules (although some first instance decisions rendered in Luxembourg – which have not been confirmed by the Court of Appeal – no longer apply this condition); - the principles of fair trial and due process have been complied with and in particular the judgment was granted following proceedings where the counterparty had the opportunity to appear, and if the counterparty appeared, to present a defense; and - the judgment of the U.S. does not contravene Luxembourg public policy and has not been obtained fraudulently If an original action is brought in Luxembourg, without prejudice to specific conflict of law rules, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law (i) if the choice of such foreign law was not made _bona fide and/or (ii) if the foreign law was not pleaded and proved and/or (iii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules. ----- In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. Also, an _exequatur_ may be refused in respect of punitive damages. In practice, Luxembourg courts tend not to review the merits of a foreign judgment, although there is no clear statutory prohibition of such review. Further, in the event of any proceedings being brought in a Luxembourg court in respect of a monetary obligation expressed to be payable in a currency other than Euro, a Luxembourg court would have power to give a judgment expressed as an order to pay a currency other than Euro. However, enforcement of the judgment against any party in Luxembourg would be available only in Euro and for such purposes all claims or debts would be converted into Euro. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

We highlight that the information presented for comparative purposes in respect of the period from August 1, 2022 to April 30, 2023 has not been audited or subject to review. These Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements are the responsibility of the President. Our role is to express a conclusion on these Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements based on our review. ----- We conducted our review in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, and the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) applicable to such engagement. A review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 – the standard of the IFRSs as adopted by the European Union applicable to interim financial reporting. This report is governed by French law. The Courts of France shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any claim, difference or dispute which may arise out of or in connection with our engagement letter or this report. Each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to object to an action being brought in any of those Courts, to claim that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum or to claim that those Courts do not have jurisdiction.

Overview 1.1. General information on the parent company The parent company, AFFLELOU, is a French joint stock company controlled by NALA AFFLELOU BIDCO LIMITED, headquartered at 1 bis, Tour Trinity, Esplanade de la Défense, Courbevoie (92400). The “Group” comprises the parent company and its subsidiaries. 1.2. General information on the Group The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries in Africa, the Middle East and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU” banner. The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of products to franchisees, notably branded company products. At April 30, 2024, the Group manages a network of 1,434 stores (not including 9 remaining OPTICAL DISCOUNT stores, currently being gradually closed), of which 171 are directly owned, with the aim of (i) retaining control over flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies, (ii) testing new business initiatives and identifying best practices before applying them to the franchisees, (iii) managing the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group, and (iv) facilitating negotiations with suppliers thanks to the volume of purchases from the networks. Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com and malentille.com websites. 1.3. Context of the publication The condensed nine months consolidated financial statements for the six months on April 30, 2024, have been prepared within the framework of a contemplated refinancing and distribution to its shareholders. These condensed nine months consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union as of August 1, 2023. The rules applied in preparing these financial statements are described in Note 4 “Accounting policies”. These condensed nine months consolidated financial statements for the nine months on April 30, 2024, were approved by the President of AFFLELOU on June 24, 2024. The condensed nine months consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, unless otherwise stated. The following tables contain data items that have been rounded up or down on an individual basis. Arithmetic calculations based on rounded items may show discrepancies with the aggregates or subtotals displayed herein 2. Highlights 2.1. Change in the networks The Group operated a network of 1,434 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores (not including 9 remaining OPTICAL DISCOUNT stores, currently being gradually closed). The 1,434 stores as at April 30, 2024, break down into 1,322 optical stores and 112 audio stores, compared with 1,310 optical stores and 108 audio stores respectively on July 31, 2023. 4 ----- ##### p,, g p compared with 510 as at July 31, 2023, of which hearing aid centers, only dedicated to the hearing aid activity. These points of sales include 447 corners compared with 402 as at July 31, 2023, which were located inside optical stores in France, Spain, and Belgium and Switzerland. The portfolio of directly owned stores, mainly in France and Spain, represented 171 stores as at April 30, 2024 (including 5 OPTICAL DISCOUNT stores), compared to 177 as at July 31, 2023. The ALAIN AFFLELOU networks covered 19 countries as at April 30, 2024 (including Andorra and Mauritius), divided into three geographic areas: ▪ France : 914 stores, ▪ Spain : 368 stores, ▪ other countries : 152 stores. 2.2. Group focus on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand Since the last fiscal year, the Group decided to focus its growth on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand alone, which is now the sole brand for the development of its optical and hearing aid network, under the name Alain Afflelou opticien et acousticien. This decision to concentrate our efforts on the growth of the eponymous ALAIN AFFLELOU brand across all our territories goes hand in hand with the gradual discontinuation of the OPTICAL DISCOUNT brand, whose first-price positioning is less differentiating since the “100% santé” regulations have created a segment of completely free optical and hearing aid equipment, which each retailer is obliged to market. This unification under the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner enables us to optimize the Group's resources, both in terms of communication - our advertising now unites our audio and optical products under the Alain Afflelou opticien et acousticien banner - and internal organization. The OPTICAL DISCOUNT store network is gradually disappearing, with only 9 stores remaining as at April 30, 2024, with a goal to have completely terminated the banner within the end of the current calendar year. The Group's accounting and financial data relating to the OPTICAL DISCOUNT chain is presented as discontinued operations within the Group's financial statements. 2.3. Capital transactions On November 2023, LSL2 and Holding AA-OC sold 551,968 ADP 1 to Marelle Partners. These transaction between shareholders had no impact on Group shareholders' equity. During the Annual General Meeting on December 15, 2023, the shareholders authorized the Chairman of the Company to allocate free AGADP1 shares on one or more occasions, up to a limit of 3,127,819 AGADP1. It being specified that the total number of free AGADP1 shares allocated by the Chairman may never exceed the overall limit of 1.50% of the Company's existing share capital at the date of the decision. The shareholders also decided to distribute a dividend of 5,150,000 euros, to be deducted from the balance of retained earnings. 2.4. Evolution of our Group’s shareholder structure In 2023, Lion Capital successfully raised a continuation fund to give liquidity to its investors and co-investors and to continue its historical partnerships with some of its participations, such as the AFFLELOU Group. In the context of this transaction, the shareholding of AFFLELOU was restructured, giving the opportunity to CDPQ (Caisse de la Province du Québec), which previously indirectly held 30% of the AFFLELOU Group, to sell its stake to this continuation fund. The transaction was completed in November 2023 and has no effect on the Group’s financial structure. Lion Capital will therefore continue to control the AFFLELOU Group, through holding companies having, as of today, a 71.25% stake of AFFLELOU, while Mr Alain Afflelou’s family keep on holding 28.53% and Marelle Partner holds 0.22% of equity in AFFLELOU. 2.5. Program to reduce the directly owned stores portfolio in France In early 2023, the Group began a strategy to reduce the directly owned stores portfolio in France. Our directly owned store network represented 93 stores as at July 31, 2022, following the buyback of two portfolios of 20 stores (12 in Normandy and 8 stores in the Bordeaux region). This strategy is driven by our belief that, in most cases, our franchise organization brings maximum efficiency to our network. Nevertheless, in certain situations, we aim to continue to directly own certain banner’s stores, like in tourist areas where we would like to retain control over the brand’s image at our flagship stores, and large traffic areas like big shopping centers or main streets in large cities, where the significant financial means needed may 5 ----- ##### q p q y, p (except where such stores are in the Paris region or are particularly profitable). This strategy to reduce our portfolio was accompanied by a plan to allow store managers to become franchisees with our Adelante program, thus buttressing the expansion of our banner together with a plan to give them more autonomy in their day-to-day business. As a consequence, the directly owned stores portfolio in France was brought back to 76 stores as at April 30, 2024, as compared to 83 as at July 31, 2023. In Spain, we continue to keep a strong directly owned store structure, with no specific plan to reduce the portfolio. 3. Change in the scope of consolidation 3.1. Change in the scope of consolidation during the nine months period on April 30, 2024 No change of scope of consolidation to be noticed. 3.2. Change in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2023 On December 26, 2022, AA NORMANDIE, wholly owned by L’OPTICIEN AFFELOU, was absorbed by the latter. On January 31, 2023, OPTIQUE BAGAVI, OPTIQUE CARON, OPTIQUE CRISTEL, OPTIQUE GAZOLEO and VINELOP, all wholly owned, after the absorption of AA NORMANDIE by L’OPTICIEN AFFLELOU, were absorbed by the latter. 4. Accounting policies 4.1. Standards and rules applies ##### 4.1.1. Standards, interpretations, and amendments mandatory as of April 30, 2024 ##### The Group’s condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period on April 30, 2024, were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 dated July 19, 2002. The texts of these standards are available on the European Union's EUR-Lex Internet portal at the following address: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02008R1126-20160101 The international standards include IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), IAS (International Accounting Standards), as well as their interpretations SIC (Standing Interpretations Committee) and IFRIC (International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee). The condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months period on April 30, 2024, were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union, which permits the presentation of a selection of explanatory notes. Those statements do not take into account the draft standards and interpretations that were still at exposure draft stage with the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and the IFRIC as of the balance sheet date, or standards whose application is not mandatory at April 30, 2024. The accompanying notes do not contain all the information required for the complete annual consolidated financial statements and should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2023. The condensed nine months consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting policies and methods applied by the Company in preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2023, with the exception of income taxes and employee benefits, which are subject to specific evaluation methods (see Note 4.3). 6 ----- ##### g p p pp g p y, p p g, applied since August 1, 2023 : ▪ Amendments to IAS 12: “International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules”(see 4.1.3 « Other regulatory developments »). ▪ Amendments to IAS 12: “Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction”. ▪ Amendments to IAS 8: “Definition of accounting estimates” ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2: “Disclosure of accounting policies” These standards and amendments do not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements for the nine-month period on April 30, 2024. These standards and amendments are not applicable to the Group : ▪ IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts“ ▪ Amendments to IFRS 17: “Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – Comparative Information” 4.1.2. Standards, interpretations, and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved or in the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet mandatory as of April 30, 2024 The following standards and interpretations have no impact on the Group’s financial statements. ▪ Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 : « Supplier Finance Arrangements » The impact of the application of the following amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently being assessed. ▪ Amendments to IFRS 16 : « Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback » ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 : - “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current” - “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date” - “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants” ▪ Amendments to IAS 21: “Lack of Exchangeability”. ##### 4.1.3. Other regulatory developments ##### Following on from work undertaken at OECD level, on December 16, 2022, the member states of the European Union adopted a directive aimed at establishing minimum taxation for multinational groups. Member States should transpose these new rules by December 31, 2023, at the latest, for application in principle to tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The so-called GloBE rules (global rules to combat tax base erosion) aim to ensure that multinational companies with consolidated sales in excess of €750 million (for at least two of the last four preceding consecutive financial years) pay an effective tax rate of at least 15% on profits generated in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Group is not concerned by Pillar 2, as its consolidated sales are below the regulatory threshold. 4.2. Operations discontinued, sold, or held for sale The consolidated income statement for the for the nine months period on April 30, 2024, presents the franchisor activity OPTICAL DISCOUNT as discontinued operations (Note 2.2. ""Group focus on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand"" to the financial statement as of July 31, 2023), while the balance sheet remains unchanged in accordance with IFRS 5 standard. 7 ----- ##### p |(in thousands of euros)|30/04/2024 30/04/2023| |---|---| ||(9 months) (9 months)| |Revenue Cost of purchases Wages and salaries including social security contributions Other purchases and external expenses Duties and taxes other than income tax Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment|939 2,576 (1,581) (1,602) (195) (407) (182) (717) (4) (10) 930 (172)| |Operating income from ordinary activities|(93) (332)| |Other non-recurring operating items|(4) (354)| |Operating profit|(98) (686)| |Financial income Borrowing costs Other financial expense|(0) 3 (0) (1) (4) 36| |Net financial income/(expense)|(5) 37| |Net income before tax of consolidated companies|(102) (649)| |Tax income/(expense)|(11) (11)| |Net income from discontinued operations or operations held for sale|(113) (659)| ##### 4.2.2.

Income tax ##### The tax expense for the period (current and deferred) is determined on the basis of the estimated effective tax rate for the current fiscal year for each tax entity and sub-group. ##### 4.3.2. Employee benefits ##### The nine months period expense related to post-employment benefits is equal to three-quarter of the net cost calculated for the year ended in July 31, 2023. Pursuant to the requirements of IAS 19 and IAS 34, the net post-employment benefit obligation stated in the interim financial statements takes into account significant changes in market conditions. There were no significant changes in market conditions during the nine months period on April 30, 2024. ##### 4.3.3. Seasonal pattern of revenue ##### Income from ordinary activities, operating income and all operating indicators are characterized by a low level of seasonality attributable to the recurrence of business throughout the year. ##### 4.3.4. Impairment test ##### The impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks, and intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment is carried out once every year and at the end of the financial year. Thus, for interim financial statements purposes no impairment test was carried out and the latest valuation was made for the financial year 2023. 8 ----- #####, j g, The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS require or permit the use of the fair value option. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including the trademark), the measurement of provisions and impairment of assets, and the assumptions used to measure debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future results could differ from such estimates.

The increase for the nine months period ended in April 2024 is mainly due to the interest on financial investments and income from the 3-month Euribor cap at 0.5%. The decrease in interest on convertible bonds is mainly due the conversion into shares of all the residual convertible bonds on June 30, 2023. Furthermore, the increase in interest expenses on high-yield bonds is due to the rise in the Euribor rate on the subordinated tranche (SN). Other financial expense mainly consists of various financial charges totalling €2,224 thousand as of April 30, 2024, primarily related to foreign exchange losses. As of April 30, 2023, various financial charges amounted to €2,945 thousand and were of the same nature. 12 ----- ##### 6.1.7.1.

Notifications, lawsuits, and disputes ##### Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of their business, including disputes with tax, social security, or customs authorities. Notification of VAT deductibility On December 8, 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities amounted to €1.5 million. Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on August 16, 2018, the group decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal adjustment of €1 million and €0.5 million in penalties and interest for late payment. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The decision The French administrative tribunal of Paris rejected our claim on April 6, 2022. The Group also called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1 million The Group appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal, which handed down its decision on January 30, 2024, confirming the decision of the Administrative Tribunal. The Group has since decided to claim this decision before the Supreme Court (“Conseil d’Etat”). 16 ----- ##### p g p Following a tax audit launched in 2015 covering the period from August 1, 2009, to July 31, 2012, the French tax authorities issued an initial tax reassessment notice primarily reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss- making subsidiaries in 2010, claiming that the sale price would have had to be higher for it to be considered at arm’s length. The company and its legal and tax advisors believe that there are strong arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities. If, however, the arguments of the tax authorities were to prevail, the potential amount of the adjustment would be €21.1 million on the tax base. On November 23, 2023, the Administrative Tribunal handed down its decision confirming the position of the tax authorities. The Group has since decided to claim this decision before the Administrative Court of Appeal. Verification of supplier payment terms On September 21, 2020, DIRECCTE initiated an inspection in connection with the commitment made by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur to comply with the legal payment terms formulated at the time of its application for a government-guaranteed loan. On March 2, 2021, the company submitted its comments on the payment terms monitored by DIRECCTE for the period from June 1, 2020 to August 31, 2020, and produced all documents in support of these observations. After a hearing on March 2, 2021, DIRECCTE drew up a report of the statement and took copies of the documents. By letter dated April 17, 2023, the DIRECCTE notified the company Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of an administrative penalty of €83 thousand for non-compliance with certain payment deadlines. By letter dated June 23, 2023, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur submitted its observations to the DIRECCTE. To date, no response has been received to these observations. Notification of a tax inspection The companies ALAIN AFFLELOU FRANCHISEUR and 3AB OPTIQUE DEVELOPPEMENT were notified by the “Direction des Vérifications Nationales et Internationales” (DVNI) on February 3, 2023, of a notice of audit of their accounts covering the periods from August 1, 2019, to July 31, 2022. On December 8, 2023, the “DVNI” notified the company 3AB OPTIQUE DEVELOPPEMENT that no correction had been made. On December 20, 2023, ALAIN AFFLELOU FRANCHISEUR was notified of the first proposed adjustments, which interrupted the statute of limitations and mainly concerned the recognition of the research tax credit, even though the tax inspection is still in progress. Notification of URSSAF inspection The company L’OPTICIEN AFFLELOU received a notification from the URSSAF of Ile de France on February 9, 2023, regarding a verification of the application of legislations related to mandatory contributions and levies collected by collecting agencies, starting from January 1, 2020. The audit operations took place from April 11, 2023, to October 12, 2023, and the maximum amount at stake is €0.1 million. 6.4.

Nanterre Commissaire aux Comptes Membre de la compagnie régionale de Versailles et du Centre ##### Year ended 31 July 2023 Statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements To the of shareholders of Afflelou: Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Afflelou for the year ended July 31, 2023. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 July 2023 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Basis for Opinion  **Audit Framework ##### We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.  **Independence ##### We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1[st ] of August 2022 to the date of our report. ----- ##### Justification of Assessments ##### In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. The impairment tests of goodwills, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs are performed in accordance with the method described in notes “4.8. Impairment of non-current-assets (IAS 36)” and “6.2.6. Impairment testing of non-current intangible assets” to the consolidated financial statements. We have assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, which is based on a set of estimates, and we have reviewed the data and assumptions used by your Group to perform these valuations. On this basis, we assessed the reasonableness of these estimates. Specific Verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the President’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements were approved by President. ##### Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements ##### Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered ----- ##### material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial ##### statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit ##### procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting ##### estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, ##### based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether ##### these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities ##### or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

At July 31[st], 2023, the Group manages a network of 1,440 stores, of which 177 are directly owned, with the aim of (i) retaining control over flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies, (ii) testing new business initiatives and identifying best practices before applying them to the franchisees, (iii) managing the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group, and (iv) facilitating negotiations with suppliers thanks to the volume of purchases from the networks. Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com, malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites. ##### 2. Highlights ##### 2.1. Change in the networks The Group operated a network of 1,440 stores, including 1,418 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores (and 22 remaining OPTICAL DISCOUNT stores, currently being gradually closed). The 1,418 ALAIN AFFLELOU stores break down into 1,310 optical stores and 108 audio stores, compared with 1,274 optical stores and 99 audio stores respectively on July 31[st], 2022. ----- Net openings of optical stores (excluding Optical Discount) 10 18",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Group focus on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand At the beginning of last year, the Group decided to focus its growth on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand alone, which is now the sole brand for the development of its optical and hearing aid network, under the name Alain Afflelou opticien et acousticien. This decision to concentrate our efforts on the growth of the eponymous ALAIN AFFLELOU brand across all our territories goes hand in hand with the gradual discontinuation of the OPTICAL DISCOUNT brand, whose first-price positioning is less differentiating since the “100% santé” regulations have created a segment of completely free optical and hearing aid equipment, which each retailer is obliged to market. This unification under the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner enables us to optimize the Group's resources, both in terms of communication - our advertising now unites our audio and optical products under the Alain Afflelou opticien et acousticien banner - and internal organization. The OPTICAL DISCOUNT store network will gradually disappear until December 31[st], 2024, with some stores having been transformed into ALAIN AFFLELOU stores beforehand. By July 31[st], 2023, this network had already been reduced to 22 stores. The Group's accounting and financial data relating to the OPTICAL DISCOUNT chain will henceforth be presented as discontinued operations within the Group's financial statements. Summary sales data for the OPTICAL DISCOUNT chain will be presented as a reminder, with the Group's sales performance history restated to include the contribution of OPTICAL DISCOUNT stores. 2.3. Capital transactions 2.3.1. Conversion of common shares into preferred shares At September 30, 2022, 1,872,660 common shares (AO) held by Holding AA-OC were converted into 1,872,660 preference shares T (ADP T), with a parity of one new ADP T per AO presented for conversion. 2.3.2. Early redemption of bonds On September 30[th], 2022, Afflelou SAS voluntarily redeemed 257,636 OCAs (together with capitalized and accrued interest thereon to the redemption date), representing a total amount (including principal and interest) of one million euros. 2.3.3. Conversion of convertible bonds into shares On June 30[th], 2023, the shareholders decided to carry out a capital increase in consideration for the extinguishment of all convertible bonds, i.e.  9,281,123 ADP D to LSL2 for a nominal amount of €4,956 thousand and an issue premium of €34,804 thousand  2,388,089 ADP D to AAOC Holding for a nominal amount €1,275 thousand and a premium of €8,955 thousand. 2.3.4. Capital reduction On June 30[th], 2023, Afflelou carried out a capital reduction not motivated by losses in the amount of €117,381 thousand, through the cancellation of 140,702,253 common shares, 29,705,527 ADP D, 23,464,420 ADP T and 25,943,037 ADP D'. This capital reduction was allocated in full to the Company's ""Share premium"" account. ----- ##### 2.3.5. Creation of new preference shares : ADP F and ADP 1 On July 27, 2023, the shareholders approved the creation of a new class of preferred shares in the Company, namely ADP F and ADP 1 (see note 6.2.13. Shareholders' equity). To this end, 1,000,000 ordinary shares were converted into 1,000,000 ADP F and 551,968 ordinary shares were converted into 551,968 ADP 1. 2.4. Head office relocation On August 1[st], 2022, the Group signed a new lease to establish its headquarters in premises at Tour Trinity in Paris-la Défense. The Group moved into these new premises in January 2023. Given the contract start date on August 1, 2022, a lease term of 9 years, and the consideration of a rent-free period of 3.6 million euros (until December 13, 2024), the initial amount of right-of-use and therefore IFRS 16 lease liability amounts to 9.6 million euros (see note 6.2.5.1 and note 6.2.18.1). 2.5. COVID-19 epidemic impact on the past financial year The Group considers that the COVID-19 epidemic, which had sevelery affected its business and that of its network in calendar years 2020 and 2021, has no longer impact on its operations. The catching-up of activity in the sector has restored activity levels comparable to 2019 in 2021, and the sector has returned to steady growth. Lastly, organizational problems linked to the spread of the epidemic, particularly in China, were resolved by the end of the first half of 2022. 2.6. Russo-Ukrainian war and inflationary tensions The group has implemented a risk matrix since 2021. Following the start of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, the Afflelou Group analyzed its potential exposure to the consequences of the war between Ukraine and Russia, taking into account the international sanctions environment and the potential impact on supply chains. The Group does not have direct operations in these regions and does not source its supplies from there. Therefore, these events could only indirectly affect the Group's activities, considering the impact on the global economic situation. However, these events occurred within a context of significant inflation in 2022, especially on consumer goods. The Group has strengthened its risk monitoring and control mechanisms on its activities, particularly focusing on the impact of inflation. A study was conducted in mid-2022 to model the impact of inflation on the financial health of franchisees, based on assumptions of increased purchasing costs not passed on and inflation on operational expenses (personnel costs, rents, and external charges). The results of this analysis showed a limited impact on the franchisees' results and a very marginal impact on the Group's results. The average results of franchisees for the calendar year 2022 across the entire network confirmed the absence of a significant deterioration in the gross profit margin and a level of profitability close to pre-COVID-19 levels, within an otherwise very positive context of franchisees' financial health. ----- ##### 2.7. AA Asia limited placed in dormancy As the Group no longer operates in Asia, it has been decided to place its subsidiary AA ASIA limited in dormant status. This operation was formalized on August 02, 2022. ##### 3. Change in the scope of consolidation ##### 3.1. Change in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2023 On December 26[th], 2022, AA NORMANDIE, wholly owned by L’OPTICIEN AFFELOU, was absorbed by the latter. On January 31[st], 2023, OPTIQUE BAGAVI, OPTIQUE CARON, OPTIQUE CRISTEL, OPTIQUE GAZOLEO and VINELOP, all wholly owned, after the absorption of AA NORMANDIE by L’OPTICIEN AFFLELOU, were absorbed by the latter. 3.2. Change in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2022 On January 31[st], 2022, Ottica (previously wholly owned by its parent company) was merged into L'opticien Afflelou. On January 31[st], 2022, Cathare Optique and Academie Vision and Groupe Optique Mediterranee, (previously all wholly owned by their parent company) were absorbed by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur through a merger. On October 6[th], 2021, L'opticien Afflelou acquired 100% of the capital and voting rights of A+ and Eric Afflelou, which operate various optical eyewear stores in Bordeaux and the surrounding area. Finally, on January 4[th], 2022, L'opticien Afflelou acquired 100% of the capital and voting rights of the companies in the Caron group, each of these six companies operating various optical eyewear stores in the Seine Maritime region. ##### 4. Accounting policies ##### 4.1. Standards and rules applied 4.1.1. Standards, interpretations, and amendments mandatory as of July 31st, 2023 The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31st, 2023, were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 dated July 19[th], 2002. The texts of these standards are available on the European Union's EUR-Lex Internet portal at the following address: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02008R1126-20160101 These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC). ----- ##### At the end of the financial year, there were no differences impacting the Group between the standards used and the standards adopted by the IASB that are mandatory for the financial year presented. The accounting principles applied remain unchanged from the previous year, except for the adoption of the following texts, applied since August 1st, 2022:  Amendments to IFRS 3 : « Reference to the conceptual framework »  Amendments to IAS 16 : « Property, plant and equipment : proceeds before Intended Use»  Amendments to IAS 37 : « Onerous Contracts—Cost of Fulfilling a Contract »  « Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 ». These amendments do not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended on July 31[st], 2023. 4.1.2. Standards, interpretations, and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved or in the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet mandatory as of July 31st, 2023 The following standards and interpretations have no impact on the Group’s financial statements.  IFRS 17 « Insurance contracts », including amendments to IFRS 17  Amendments to IFRS 17 : « Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 – comparative information »  Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7 : « Supplier Finance Arrangements »  Amendments to IAS 12 « International tax reform – Pillar Two Model Rules » ( see 4.1.3 « Other regulatory developments »). The impact of the application of the following amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently being assessed.  Amendments to IAS 8 : « Definition of accounting estimates »  Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 : « Disclosure of accounting policies »  Amendments to IAS 12 : « Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction».  Amendments to IFRS 16 : « Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback »  Amendments to IAS 1 : - “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current” - “Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current - Deferral of Effective Date” - “Non-current Liabilities with Covenants” 4.1.3. Other regulatory developments  Pension reform French law no. 2023-270 regarding amending financing of social security 2023, incorporating the pension reform, was published in the “Journal Officiel” on April 15, 2023. This reform gradually raises the legal retirement age (age of entitlement) in France from 62 to 64. This represents a change in the post-employment benefit plan within the meaning of IAS 19 ""Employee Benefits"". As such, the positive or negative impact of the plan change on the amount of the IAS 19 commitment is a past service cost which must be recognized in net income (personnel expenses) at the date of the plan change. ----- ##### The Group is impacted by this reform insofar as, for the valuation of its commitments in respect of retirement indemnities, it adopted assumptions of a retirement age of 62 or 63, depending on the employee category. These assumptions, rendered obsolete by the reform, have been modified. The Group has estimated the impact of the change in plan on the valuation of its commitments, which amounts to income of €0.2 million. This non-material impact has been recognised in the income statement in these financial statements.. The valuation of retirement commitments is presented in note 6.2.14 ""Employee benefits"".  Minimum tax regime for multinationals (« Pillar 2 ») Following on from work undertaken at OECD level, on December 16[th], 2022, the member states of the European Union adopted a directive aimed at establishing minimum taxation for multinational groups. Member States should transpose these new rules by December 31[st], 2023, at the latest, for application in principle to tax years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The so-called GloBE rules (global rules to combat tax base erosion) aim to ensure that multinational companies with consolidated sales in excess of €750 million (for at least two of the last four preceding consecutive financial years) pay an effective tax rate of at least 15% on profits generated in each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. The Group is not concerned by Pillar 2, as its consolidated sales are below the regulatory threshold. 4.2. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control. Rounding may in some cases result in immaterial differences in the totals of the tables in the notes. 4.2.1. Consolidated entities The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, when it: ▪has power over the investee; ▪is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and ▪has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits. Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the Group as a whole. 4.2.2. Associates The Group has no interests in joint-ventures or associates. 4.2.3. Business combinations The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations. A business combination is defined as a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business is defined as ----- ##### an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest), or generating other income from ordinary activities. Thus, a business is composed of inputs and processes, applied to those inputs, that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method: ▪the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including any earnout payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earn-out payment are recognised in profit or loss; ▪the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by goodwill, which is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value has been determined, adjustments are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognised directly in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured: ▪either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognised for the portion related to non-controlling interests (full goodwill method); ▪or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method). Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognised either as adjustments to the consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the provisions of IFRS 3. In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is reclassified to profit or loss. 4.3. Changes in presentation and methods for comparability purposes The consolidated income statement for the fiscal year 2022 has been modified to present the franchisor activity OPTICAL DISCOUNT as discontinued operations (Note 2.2. ""Group focus on the ALAIN AFFLELOU brand""), while the balance sheet remains unchanged in accordance with IFRS 5 standard. ----- ##### 4.3.1.

Basis of valuation, judgements, and use of estimates The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS require or permit the use of the fair value option. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including the trademark), the measurement of provisions and impairment of assets, and the assumptions used to measure debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following notes: |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2023 31/07/2022 (12 months) (12 months)| |---|---| |Revenue Cost of purchases Wages and salaries including social security contributions Other purchases and external expenses Duties and taxes other than income tax Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment|3,328 6,503 (2,112) (3,745) (567) (1,157) (852) (1,606) (5) (16) (600) 274| |Operating income from ordinary activities|(808) 254| |Other non-recurring operating items|(451) (2,648)| |Operating profit|(1,259) (2,394)| |Financial income Borrowing costs Other financial expense|3 22 (1) (2) 63 4| |Net financial income/(expense)|64 24| |Net income before tax of consolidated companies|(1,195) (2,370)| |Tax income/(expense)|(23) 533| |Net income from discontinued operations or operations held for sale|(1,218) (1,838)| |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2023 31/07/2022 restated * (12 months) (12 months)| |---|---| |Operating income from ordinary activities Amortisation of intangible assets Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment Change in customer provisions and inventories|(808) 254 18 27 50 57 719 (280)| |Adjusted EBITDA|(21) 59| ----- ##### Notes 4.19 et Deferred tax Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred 6.1.8.4 tax assets relating to tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences The accounting estimates used in the presentation of the financial statements as of July 31[st], 2022 and July 31[st ], 2021, have been made in the context of the ""COVID-19 crisis"", which has resulted in uncertainty about the economic and financial outlook. Accordingly, the Group has considered reliable information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 4.5. Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 4.5.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognised in “Other financial income” or “Other financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of that gain or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of foreign exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in Note 4.12. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at the date the fair value was determined. 4.5.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows:  items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date;  items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period, as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations;  differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the period are recognised in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation” in consolidated shareholders' equity. |Notes|Estimate|Nature of estimate| |---|---|---| |Notes 4.8, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 6.2.3.3 et 6.2.4.2|Impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks, and intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment|At the level of individual CGUs Key assumptions used to determine value in use (discount rate, perpetual growth rate, projected cash flows)| |Notes 4.13 et 6.2.8|Inventories|Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate impairment| |Note 4.10 et 6.2.5|IFRS 16|Main assumptions used to determine lease liabilities| |Notes 4.16 et 6.6.3|Notifications, lawsuits, and disputes|Measurement of provisions and liabilities| |Notes 4.17 et 6.2.14|Employee benefits|Measurement of provisions related to employee benefits and similar| |Notes 4.19 et 6.1.8.4|Deferred tax|Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences| ----- ##### The accounts drawn up in other currencies relate to the activities of subsidiaries in Switzerland and Asia 4.6. Intangible assets excluding goodwill An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually within the cash- generating unit (CGU) to which they belong. Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria: ▪Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition. ▪Prospective long-term profitability. Licences and software have useful lives of between two and four years and are amortised over the relevant period. 4.7. Property, plant, and equipment 4.7.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the alternative method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant, and equipment. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 4.7.2. Depreciation The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment held: Property, plant, and equipment Useful life Depreciation method Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line Fixtures and fittings 6 to 10 years Straight line Transport equipment 3 to 4 years Straight line Industrial machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Straight line Technical equipment under finance leases 3 to 10 years Straight line Other property, plant, and equipment 3 to 5 years Straight line |equipment held:|Col2|Col3| |---|---|---| |Property, plant, and equipment|Useful life|Depreciation method| |Buildings Fixtures and fittings Transport equipment Industrial machinery and equipment Technical equipment under finance leases Other property, plant, and equipment|10 to 20 years 6 to 10 years 3 to 4 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 5 years|Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line| ----- ##### 4.8. Impairment of non-current assets (IAS 36) Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, CGUs or groups of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from unfavourable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used as of the acquisition date. Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on projections of expected future cash flows, considering the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalisation in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs, the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items” in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may be reversed later if the recoverable amount comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another method is deemed more pertinent. 4.9. Operations discontinued, sold, or held for sale Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated first to goodwill and then to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well as gains and losses on subsequent measurement are recognised in profit or loss. Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. Operations discontinued, sold, or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that:  represents a separate activity or geographical area;  is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area; or  is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale. The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. ----- ##### When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period. 4.10. Leases 4.10.1. The Groupe as lessee Leases giving the lessee control over the use of an identified asset for a given period in exchange for consideration fall within the scope of IFRS 16. The Group’s lessee companies recognise all leases, regardless of their nature, whether operating or finance leases, in the form of a right-of-use asset in exchange for a lease liability. The lease liability is initially determined on the basis of the present value of lease payments unpaid as of that date, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or at the incremental borrowing rate specific to the country, terms and currency of the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable payments based on a benchmark or rate and payments arising from options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. After the initial measurement, the lease liability is reduced by the payments made and increased by the interest expense. It is remeasured to reflect any change in future lease payments in the event of further negotiations with the lessor, a change in a benchmark or rate, or if options are reassessed. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero in the case of a reduction in the scope of leases. The right-of-use asset determined at the outset includes the initial lease liability, the initial direct costs, any leasehold rights, and any obligations to renovate the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessor. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. In the income statement, depreciation expense is recognised in operating profit or loss, and interest expense in financial income or expense. The tax impact of this consolidation restatement is taken into account through the recognition of deferred taxes. The lease term used corresponds to the non-cancellable period, to periods covered by an extension option whose exercise is reasonably certain, and to periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise is reasonably certain, taking into account the economics of the lease (and not only the legal characteristics), as well as the impact of any non-removable fixtures and fittings related to the lease that could constitute an incentive to exercise a renewal option. The Group applies:  the exemptions permitted by IFRS 16 for leases with a term of less than 12 months or where the underlying asset is of low value (less than €5,000);  the amendment relating to rent concessions (see note 6.1.4. “Other purchases and external expenses”). 4.10.2. The Group as lessor The Group has leases that are subleased to third parties (mainly franchisees). ----- ##### As lessor, the Group classifies its leases as operating or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, and otherwise as an operating lease. For finance leases, the Group recognises the amount of the net investment as a financial receivable and derecognises the right-of-use asset of the related lease. Any difference between the right-of-use asset and the net investment in the sublease agreement is recognised in profit or loss. The lease liability of the main lease is maintained as a liability. A lease is classified as an operating lease if the classification criteria (described above) are not met. For operating leases, the lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 4.11. Other financial assets In accordance with the principles of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are recognised and measured either at amortised cost, at fair value through equity or at fair value through profit or loss based on the following two criteria:  an initial criterion relating to the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of each instrument. The analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to determine whether these flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (the so-called SPPI test or Solely Payment of Principal and Interest);  a second criterion relating to the business model used by the company to manage its financial assets. IFRS 9 defines three different business models: (i) a first business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, (ii) a second model whose economic objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling financial assets, and (iii) “other” business models Identifying the business model and analysing the characteristics of the contractual cash flows requires judgement to ensure that financial assets are classified in the appropriate category. Where the financial asset is an investment in an equity instrument and is not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present the gains and losses on this investment in other comprehensive income. Except for trade receivables, which are measured in accordance with their transaction price within the meaning of IFRS 15, financial assets are, upon initial recognition, measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. At each balance sheet date, financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through equity (recyclable) are subject to impairment testing based on the method used to estimate expected credit losses. Financial assets also include derivative financial instruments that are valued at fair value in accordance with the standards. 4.12. Derivatives In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet in other current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and carried at fair value as of the transaction date. Change in the fair value of ----- ##### derivative instruments is always recognised in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied. Hedge accounting is applied only if the following conditions are met:  a hedging relationship is clearly identified, formalized, and documented from the date of implementation;  the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated on a prospective and retrospective basis. The results thus obtained must be within a confidence interval of between 80% and 125%. Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair value. The effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in profit or loss. 4.13. Inventories Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens products (held as part of the Group’s central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly owned stores (consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products). Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any unsold items to align them with their realisable values. ##### Inventories held in stores are subject to impairment, in accordance with the following rules:  20% for products unsold for more than one year  40% for products unsold for more than two years  80% for products unsold for more than three years  100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer marketed. 4.14. Other current assets and liabilities 4.14.1. Trade receivables and other current assets Trade receivables are initially recognised at their transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost less expected losses over the life of the receivable according to the simplified model provided for in IFRS 9, as they do not include a significant financing component given the short payment terms. The assessment of expected credit losses is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age, as well as the financial analysis of debtors for material receivables. Receivables relating to the central payment and purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. Other current assets chiefly include receivables in respect of the central payment activity, including franchisees’ payments for their purchases from the referenced suppliers, as well as the discounts granted by such suppliers to franchisees, to be passed on to franchisees. The assessment of expected credit losses on other current assets is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age. ----- ##### 4.14.2. Trade payables and other current liabilities Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at amortised cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity, including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers, to be passed on to franchisees. 4.15. Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held to meet short-term cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in assets in the balance sheet less bank overdrafts, presented in financial liabilities. 4.16. Provisions and contingent liabilities A contingent liability is:  a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or  a present obligation arising from past events, but which is not recognised because: - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A provision is recognised when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including rental expenses, taxes, and related expenses), less any sublease income. 4.17. Employee benefits and similar Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes. Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. These plans and termination benefits are subject to an actuarial ----- ##### valuation by independent actuaries each year for the most important plans and at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account the level of future remuneration, the probable length of service of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover. Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognised in income from ordinary activities. Reductions, settlements, and past service costs are recognised in income from ordinary activities. The provision recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair value of plan assets. 4.18.  Borrowings 4.18.1. Loans and other financial liabilities The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying amount of a financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest date to repricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability. Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at amortised cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk. Hedging relationships are described in Note 4.12. “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are recognised as an expense immediately. 4.18.2. Compound instruments Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognised in shareholders’ equity and in loans and financial liabilities, based on their respective weighting, in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption), discounted at the market rate (considering the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination) of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or redeemable for shares. The portion recognised in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected disbursements over the term of the loan to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan recorded in borrowings. ----- ##### 4.19. Taxes 4.19.1. Current taxes The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its income is taxable. The Group recognises the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated income statement. 4.19.2. Deferred tax In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognised in profit or loss for the year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also recognised directly in equity. A deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary difference is reversed, or if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carry forwards and tax credits are limited to the estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end of the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. 4.20. Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current Given the main activities of the Group, it has been considered that the criterion for classification as current or non-current is the time taken to realise the asset or to pay the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current if more than 12 months. 4.21. Revenue recognition The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services:  Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged to franchisees. Revenue is recognised as and when control of the service is transferred over the duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognised on the date on which the underlying sale occurs.  Network sales revenues include sales of lenses, contact lenses and frames to franchisees through the Group’s central purchasing structure. These sales of products trademarked Alain Afflelou are recognised on the date of transfer of control to exclusive distributors and franchisees. Referral, del credere and distribution commissions to referenced suppliers and finder’s fees are accounted for as and when sales are made.  Revenues from final consumers, primarily related to retail sales from company-owned stores. Revenue is recognized at the date of transfer of control. The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted. ----- ##### 4.22. Cost of purchase The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely:  The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass frames;  The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass lenses;  The purchasing and supply cost of contact lenses;  The purchasing and supply cost of accessories and other goods;  Change in inventories of all of the above purchases;  Direct communication costs 4.23. Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items ##### Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other non-current operating items”. Other operating income and expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include:  restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures;  impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognised primarily following impairment testing of cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill;  capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation or from the acquisition or disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;  major disputes These items, excluded from operating income due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as part of operating income from the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events that are both limited in scope and very unusual. 4.24. Operating profit Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”. ##### 5. Segment reporting ##### 5.1. Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography into three areas, namely “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries”. The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central purchasing unit, a central listing and payment unit, and directly owned stores. The “France” segment also includes an audio business operated under a master franchise agreement. The Group has replicated the established organisation of its French operations in Spain and aims ultimately to repeat this process in the “Other countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment notably includes Belgium, ----- ##### Switzerland, and Portugal. This segment includes a central purchasing unit in Belgium, and has only a few directly owned stores, in Portugal. The segment reporting presented here was prepared based on the internal reporting data reviewed by the Chairman, the Group’s “chief operating decision maker” within the meaning of IFRS 8, who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them. Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial indicators used to measure segment performance are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. These two indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note and are reconciled with operating income from ordinary activities. Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in “Other countries”:  The trading subsidiary specialising in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB);  The Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds international supplier contracts for the entire Group. ##### The trading activity (AAB) and international supplier contract activity (AAI) impact the entire Group. The geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the “Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the results of these trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following allocation key  The result of the AAB trading subsidiary in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating country of franchisees in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames delivered to them during the year;  Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognised as revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers.

There are no more potentially dilutive shares corresponding to July 31[st], 2023. The instruments issued by the Group had no dilutive effect on the 2022 and 2023 financial years. 6.2.

This resulted in the valuation of the Alain Afflelou trademark at €650 million as part of the accounting for the takeover pursuant to IFRS 3. Given the scheduled shutdown of the franchisor's activities for the Optical Discount brand at the end of 2024, the Group recorded an impairment loss on the Optical Discount trademark, reducing the latter to a zero value. Following the annual impairment test carried out on July 31, 2023, an additional impairment of the ""Malentille"" trademark was recognized in the amount of €490 thousand. 6.2.3.

Impairment testing of non-current intangible assets 6.2.6.1. Nature of impairment testing The Group first tests the assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores, then trademarks and ultimately goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs. Impairment testing of assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores is performed on a store- by-store basis, based on the estimated market value. When in the course of negotiations, the Group has indicative offers, it uses them to measure the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the probable selling price, calculated on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each store. In 2016, the original goodwill has been allocated to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not on its own account generate cash flows substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The Optical Discount and Malentille.com trademarks and goodwill have been allocated to the “France” operating segment. 6.2.6.2 Impairment testing methodology within groups of CGUs – Estimates for the calculation of value in use Future cash flow projections are made based on budgets and medium-term business plans. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. The key assumptions other than the five-year business plan established by the Group are described below. 6.2.6.3 Impairment testing results Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2023 revealed values in use more than the net asset value of the France, Spain, and Other countries CGUs. A 5.0% variation in adjusted EBITDA in 2024, projected over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of approximately €48 million on the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €8 million of the Spain CGU and €2 million of the Other countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of July 31st, 2023. The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the France and Other countries CGUs are 9.5% and 1.5% respectively. The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the Spain CGU are 10% and 1.5% respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of a 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate used for goodwill impairment testing as of July 31st, 2023. It did not reveal any impact on the loss recognised in respect of 2023 for the France, Spain, or Other countries CGUs. |(in thousands of euros)|01/08/2022|Other Additions Repayment movements|31/07/2023| |---|---|---|---| |Long-terme sublease receivables Short-terme sublease receivables|15,677 3,052|4,400 (1) (3,634) 165 (2,989) 3,025|16,442 3,253| |Gross total|18,729|4,565 (2,990) (609)|19,696| ----- ##### 6.2.7.

Among these, there are 249,731,113 ordinary shares, 1,000,000 category F preference shares (ADP F) with preferential rights, and 551,968 category 1 preference shares (ADP 1). The Group's ordinary shares have voting rights and entitle their holders to dividends and liquidation bonuses after the rights of preference shares have been satisfied. Preference shares do not carry voting rights. ADP F are preference shares that entitle their holders to receive an annual cumulative preferential dividend of €1 million. ADP 1 are preference shares that have preferential rights in case of voluntary or judicial liquidation or any exit, concerning the amounts due to ordinary shares and ADP F (other than the preferential dividend for F). No dividends were paid in respect of fiscal 2022 in 2023. 6.2.14. Employee benefits and similar These benefits primarily cover retirement allowances in France. Retirement allowances in France In France, the retirement allowance is a lump sum paid to employees when they retire. The amount depends on the length of the individual’s service as of the date of retirement. It is determined based on collective and/or company agreements. The plan does not entitle employees to any allowance until they reach retirement age (unvested). Retirement allowances are not linked to other standard pension benefits such as pensions paid by Social Security or supplementary pension funds (ARRCO and AGIRC) Due to the pension reform, the assumptions for retirement age have been extended, and the positive impact has been recognized in the income statement for €0.2 million. The assumptions used by the collecting body are as follows : ▪Mortality table: TF-TH 14/16, ▪Rules governing retirement allowances: from the national collective agreement for eyewear retail, ▪Retirement age : ----- ##### o 65 years (franchisor) and 64 years (directly owned stores) for the Manager category, o 64 years for the Technician category, o 64 years for the Worker/Employee category, ▪Type of retirement : voluntary departure. For details of the approach adopted to take account of the French pension reform in the measurement of IAS 19 commitments in respect of retirement benefits, please refer to note 4.1.3 ""Other topical standards issues"". Assumptions 31/07/2023 31/07/2022 Rate of employers’ contributions (franchisor) 46.3% 46.4% Rate of employers’ contributions (directly owned stores) 42.0% 37.0% Rate of wage increases (franchisor) 2.3% 2.4% Rate of wage increases (directly owned stores) 3.9% 2.5% Rate of staff turnover (franchisor) 4.7% 6.6% Rate of staff turnover (directly owned stores) 13.1% 12.0% Discount rate 3.6% 2.8% Actuarial gains and losses are recognized in ""other comprehensive income"" in accordance with revised IAS 19, amounting to €57 thousand net of deferred taxes in 2023 and €247 thousand net of deferred taxes in 2022. The total amount of €212 thousand in 2023 (€29 thousand in 2022) is recognized for defined benefit plans. Additionally, in December 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) initiated a discussion regarding the service periods to which an entity attributes benefits for a particular defined benefit plan. On this issue, the IFRS IC issued the final decision ""Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service (IAS 19 'Employee Benefits')"" on May 24[th], 2021. The committee indicated that, in application of the standard, the vesting period should be the period immediately preceding the retirement age and was limited to the number of consecutive years of service defined for the plan. The method historically applied by the Group involved linearizing the vesting of benefits between the date of entry into the plan and the retirement date. The impact related to the application of this interpretation amounts to €416 thousand net of tax as of July 31[st], 2022, and has been recognized in equity. Mandatory supplementary pensions (LPP) in Switzerland The pension plan is affiliated with a collective foundation. The foundation bears the investment and longevity risk, and transfers some of the risk to an insurance company. The Group has no liabilities in respect of medical expenses. |Assumptions|31/07/2023|31/07/2022| |---|---|---| |Rate of employers’ contributions (franchisor) Rate of employers’ contributions (directly owned stores) Rate of wage increases (franchisor) Rate of wage increases (directly owned stores) Rate of staff turnover (franchisor) Rate of staff turnover (directly owned stores) Discount rate|46.3% 42.0% 2.3% 3.9% 4.7% 13.1% 3.6%|46.4% 37.0% 2.4% 2.5% 6.6% 12.0% 2.8%| ----- ##### 6.2.15.

As of July 31[st], 2022, the conversion of convertible bonds into shares amounted to €-140 million.  The impact of reclassifying convertible bonds to consolidated equity : This resulted in €5.9 million as of July 31[st], 2023, compared to €21.7 million in the previous fiscal year.  The impact, as of July 31[st], 2023, of capitalized borrowing costs : This amounted to €0.2 million, in contrast to €-1.7 million as of July 31[st], 2022. 6.2.17.3. Breakdown of the main sources of funding High-Yield bond debt of €535 million In May 2021, the Group went ahead with the early redemption of €415 million in high-yield bonds. The early redemption represented €417.5 million due to penalties of 1% on the redemption of the bond’s fixed portion (€250 million). The early redemption was carried out via the issue by AFFLELOU, the Group’s parent company, of two new bond tranches (Senior Secured Notes and Subordinated Notes) with amounts of €410 million and €75 million, respectively, on May 19, 2021. These bonds are due in May 2026 and May 2027, respectively. The €410 million tranche was further supplemented in January 2022 by an additional issuance of €50 million, increasing the total of the SSN tranche to €460 million. The bond tranches have the following characteristics: |6.2.17.2.

The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with all the terms of these bonds as of July 31[st], 2023. Revolving credit facility (RCF) of €30 million The new bond was accompanied by the establishment of a €30 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements, with a term of 54 months from May 2021. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate combining Euribor and a margin, the margin being calculated based on a leverage ratio. A non-use commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU and 3ABOD have been pledged as collateral, as have the securities of potential borrowing subsidiaries (3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the RCF would not generate penalties. Reporting obligations are the same as those of bond lenders. The Group must also certify, period-by-period, that the adjusted EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) of the prior 12 months is above €58 million. The most recent such report was made for the quarter ended 30 April 2023. This credit facility is undrawn to date and was therefore fully available as of July 31[st], 2023. The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with the terms of this credit facility as of July 31[st], 2023.

Notes on risk exposure As of July 31st, 2023, exposure to various market risks can be analysed as follows : 6.3.1. The Group’s position in relation to interest rate risk The Group’s policy is to ensure that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or, for floating rate borrowings, to contract derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows attributable to interest rate risk. At the end of 2021, the Group hedged €50 million maturing in February 2025, on the basis of a maximum variable rate indexed to Euribor at 0.50%.

The Group’s position in relation to currency risk Other than from its purchasing activity with its supplier OKIA, the Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases, which are predominantly denominated is US dollars. To that end, the Group has established agreements on purchasing conditions with OKIA, its main supplier, based on a fixed dollar/euro exchange rate. A derivative embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate compared with the rate set in the contract to be shared equally between the two parties. As part of the budget process, the Group identified the risks associated with a deterioration in the dollar/euro exchange rate for the coming year. Lastly, it has ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an appreciation of the dollar against the euro. 6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held by the Group. The Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in del credere commissions. 6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million revolving credit facility, undrawn as of July 31[st], 2023, to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed bank overdraft and discounted trade receivables. In addition, the Group periodically reviews the assumptions of its multi-year business plan. The development and net cash flow generation objectives (after investment and financing operations) have been reviewed in this context and take into account the changing environment in terms of the financing of groups under LBO. 6.3.5. Establishment of a full risk map In addition to the above-mentioned risks, the group has set up a complete mapping of the risks to which it is exposed during the past financial year. This project was implemented with the assistance of Grant Thornton. It led to the identification of 11 main risks for the Group. Following this first phase, the persons responsible for monitoring each of the risks were designated, the objective being both to anticipate their possible occurrence and to prepare actions to remedy or deal with them. For example, the Group has set up a unit to monitor inflationary risk and the consumer environment, with a threefold objective: to identify the warning signs of the impact of inflationary shocks on consumption (traffic in shops, sales volumes, observed prices), to anticipate future offers designed to counteract the impact of inflation, and to support the entire network in dealing with it. Work to analyze the impact of inflation has identified a slight deterioration in the network's profitability, compared with 2019, with no impact on the network's overall financial health. ----- ##### 6.4.

The Group’s medium-term external borrowings (high-yield bonds traded on the Irish Stock Exchange) belong to the Level 1 category; Level 2 category for hedging instruments and all other financial instruments belong to the Level 3 category.

These guarantees also include commitments given in obtaining seller credit from franchisees. Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital. Secured loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its capacity as guarantor to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of 100% of each application for financing, with in certain cases a maximum portion of the overall package. Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and guarantees made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts of the central payment structure. In addition, the Group benefits from commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees. Under franchise agreements, franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the Group for the obligations and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure.

Dependence of the Group on patents, licenses, and supply contracts The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses, or supply contracts. 6.6.3. Notifications, lawsuits, and disputes Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of their business, including disputes with tax, social security, or customs authorities. Notification of VAT deductibility On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities amounted to €1.5 million. Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal adjustment of €1 million and €0.5 million in penalties and interest for late payment. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The decision The French administrative tribunal of Paris rejected our claim on April 6, 2022. The Group has since decided to claim on this decision before the French administrative court of Appeal which is still pending. The Group also called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1 million. Other tax disputes involving corporate income tax Following a tax audit launched in 2015 covering the period from August 1[st ], 2009, to July 31[st ], 2012, the French tax authorities issued an initial tax reassessment notice primarily reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss-making subsidiaries in 2010, claiming that the sale price would have had to be higher for it to be considered at arm’s length. The company and its legal and tax advisors believe that there are strong arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities. If, however, the arguments of the tax authorities were to prevail, the potential amount of the adjustment would be €21 million on the tax base. Verification of supplier payment terms On 21 September 2020, DIRECCTE initiated an inspection in connection with the commitment made by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur to comply with the legal payment terms formulated at the time of its application for a government-guaranteed loan. On 2 March 2021, the company submitted its comments on the payment terms monitored by DIRECCTE for the period from 1 June 2020 to 31 August 2020 and produced all documents in support of these observations. After a hearing on 2 March 2021, DIRECCTE drew up a report of the statement and took copies of the documents. By letter dated April 17, 2023, the DIRECCTE notified the company Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of an administrative penalty of €83 thousand for non-compliance with certain payment deadlines. By letter dated June 23, 2023, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur submitted its observations to the DIRECCTE. To date, no response has been received to these observations. ----- ##### Notification of a tax inspection The companies ALAIN AFFLELOU FRANCHISEUR and 3AB OPTIQUE DEVELOPPEMENT were notified by the “Direction des Vérifications Nationales et Internationales” on February 3, 2023 of a notice of audit of their accounts covering the periods from August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2022.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 July 2022 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. ##### Basis for Opinion ##### ▪ Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. ▪ Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors (Code de déontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes) for the period from 1st of August 2021 to the date of our report. ----- ##### Justification of Assessments ##### In accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823 9 and R. 823 7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. The valuation tests of brands, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are performed in accordance with the method described in note 6.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements. We have assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used, which is based on a set of estimates, and we have reviewed the data and assumptions used by your Group to perform these valuations. On this basis, we assessed the reasonableness of these estimates. ##### Specific Verifications ##### We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the  President’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements were approved by President. ##### Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements ##### Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. ----- ##### As specified in Article L. 823 10 1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: ► Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ► Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. ► Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements. ► Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. ► Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ► Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Overview ##### 1.1. General information on the parent company The parent company, AFFLELOU, is a French joint stock company controlled by LION SENECA Lux 2, headquartered at 11 rue d’Argenson, 75008 Paris. The “Group” comprises the parent company and its subsidiaries. On November 7, 2022, the Chairman of AFFLELOU approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31st, 2022. 1.2. General information on the Group The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries in Africa, Asia, and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners. The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of products to franchisees, notably branded company products. The Group manages a network of 1,461 stores, of which 183 are directly owned, with the aim of (i) retaining control over flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies, (ii) testing new business initiatives and identifying best practices before applying them to the franchisees, (iii) managing the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group, and (iv) facilitating negotiations with suppliers thanks to the volume of purchases from the networks. Lastly, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com, malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites. ##### 2. Highlights ##### 2.1. Change in the networks The Group operated a network of 1,461 stores (1,362 optical stores and 99 audio stores) as of July 31st, 2022, compared with 1,449 stores (1,351 optical stores and 98 audio stores) as of July 31[st], 2021. Twelve stores joined our networks last year, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and further streamlining of the Optical Discount network. The portfolio of 99 audio stores is complemented by 344 corners in optical stores in France and Spain, bringing the total of audio points of sale to 443, compared with 396 as of July 31[st], 2021. ----- ##### As of July 31[st], 2022, the Group operated in 20 countries (including Andorra and Mauritius), split into three zones: France with 960 points of sale, Spain with 354 points of sale, and other countries representing 147 points of sale. As of July 31[st], 2022, the Group had a portfolio of 183 directly owned stores, located chiefly in France and Spain, compared with 160 stores as of July 31[st], 2021. 2.2. Change in the Group’s debt Given the performance of the network and the business dynamic since the end of the first lockdown in May 2020, the Group continued over the year ended July 31st, 2022, to generate significant cash flow, which enabled the realisation of a €59.2 million return of funds to shareholders. This shareholder transaction was implemented by way of an additional €50 million of funding from the €410 million high yield bond (Senior Secured Notes) issued by Afflelou in May 2021, with a coupon of 4.25% per annum. The Senior Secured Notes financing was thus increased to €460 million, for a total of €535 million, including the €75 million of Senior Subordinated Notes maturing in 2027. The change in the Group's financial structure was accompanied by a further reduction in the amount of convertible bonds issued by Afflelou by €151.5 million, which had been reduced last year in an early redemption of €135 million. At the end of July 2022, the capitalised outstanding convertible bonds issued by Afflelou have been reduced to €45.2 million, compared to €181.2 million at the end of July 2021. Lastly, the Group has hedged two-thirds of the variable rate bond debt (€50 million out of €75 million) on a maximum variable rate basis indexed to Euribor at 0.50% until 2025, which guarantees the Group a stable borrowing rate for the next few years, despite the high tension and volatility of interest rates since the end of 2021. 2.3. Evolution of the Group's shareholding structure and governance On January 31st, 2022, a total of 39,350,219 OCAs were converted resulting in the issue of 39,350,219 ADP D' with a nominal value of €0.534. Each of the shares issued carries a share premium of €3.02, representing a total capital increase of €21,013 thousand with a total share premium of €118,987 thousand. Subsequently, the Company's share capital was reduced by a nominal amount of €7,159 thousand, with a view to their cancellation, through the repurchase of 13,407,182 ADP D' with a nominal value of €0.534 for a total price of €47,700 thousand. Following these transactions, the governance of the Group also changed with the appointment of Anthony Afflelou as Chief Executive Officer of the Group, with Alain Pourcelot retaining his position as Chairman in charge of strategy. 2.4. Acquisition of two franchised shops by the Group During the past year, the Group integrated two franchised shops into its branch network. ▪ In September 2021, 8 shops previously owned by Eric Afflelou have been taken over in the branch division. The management of this area, concentrated in the Bordeaux area, will continue to be handled by the seller within the branch division. ----- ##### (in thousands of euros) Eric Afflelou A+ Purchase price (a) 7 688 1 154 Trademark - - Intangible assets 508 - Property, plant and equipment 423 105 Other financial assets 130 16 Deferred tax assets 26 7 Inventories 834 90 Trade receivables 326 54 Other current assets 603 121 Cash and cash equivalents 584 48 Retirement benefit obligations (101) (25) Current liabilities (1 896) (234) Fair value recognised at date of first consolidation (b) 1 437 182 Goodwill (a) - (b) 6 251 972 ##### In January 2022, the Group also took over twelve shops in the Seine Maritime region (Caron Group) from a franchisee who had left the brand. This operation is part of a carryover strategy by our branch-based division, which is not intended to keep these shops given their size, their relative dispersion, and their location in medium-sized towns.

However, the Group is maintaining its strategy of reducing the number of branches, in line with the priority given to the development of franchising. 2.5. COVID-19 epidemic The effects of the COVID-19 epidemic were marginal during the past year. In the first few months of calendar 2022, the Group benefited from a catch-up effect compared with the same period of the previous year, when around 150 shops in shopping centres were forced to close for several months. On the other hand, the epidemic continued to impact the day-to-day operations of our network, with, ----- ##### for example, organisational difficulties in the entire sector at the beginning of the year due to the spread of the virus. The Group benefited from €0.2 million in support measures from the French government as of 31 July 2022, compared to €2.6 million in the previous year. In addition, the Group also benefited credit notes from lessors for a total amount of €0.3 million as of July 31[st], 2022, compared to €1.1 million as of July 31[st], 2021 (see note 6.1.4. Other purchases and external charges). 2.6. Russo-Ukrainian war and inflationary tensions Considering the international sanctions against several Russian banks, the Group has analysed its potential exposure to the consequences of the war between Ukraine and Russia. The main consequence has been an increase in logistical and transport costs, which however does not compromise the overall operational performance. In this context of diplomatic crisis and of inflationist tension and of threat of recession, the Group has strengthened its risk observation and control systems with the implementation of a complete Group risk map. The goal is to anticipate the occurrence of major risks, such as the evolution of inflation and the consumer situation in its main areas of operation. The Group will continue to assess the consequences of these changes. ##### 3. Change in the scope of consolidation ##### 3.1. Change in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2022 On January 31[st], 2022, Ottica (previously wholly owned by its parent company) was merged into L'opticien Afflelou. On January 31[st], 2022, Cathare Optique and Academie Vision and Groupe Optique Mediterranee, (previously all wholly owned by their parent company) were absorbed by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur through a merger. On October 6[th], 2021, L'opticien Afflelou acquired 100% of the capital and voting rights of A+ and Eric Afflelou, which operate various optical eyewear stores in Bordeaux and the surrounding area. Finally, on January 4[th], 2022, L'opticien Afflelou acquired 100% of the capital and voting rights of the companies in the Caron group, each of these six companies operating various optical eyewear stores in the Seine Maritime region. 3.2. Change in the scope of consolidation during financial year 2021 On 29 October 2020, L’opticien Afflelou took control of Ottica by acquiring 100% of its shares for €1,430 thousand. OTTICA operates an optical eyewear store in the Auchan shopping centre in Semécourt (57280). In July 2021, Arkania Vision was merged into AAO and OFE was merged into AAE. Both companies were fully consolidated as of July 31[st], 2020. ----- ##### 4. Accounting policies ##### 4.1. Standards and rules applied 4.1.1. Standards, interpretations, and amendments mandatory as of July 31st, 2022 The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31[st], 2022, were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 dated July 19[th], 2002. The texts of these standards are available on the European Union's EUR-Lex Internet portal at the following address: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02008R1126-20160101 These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC). At the end of the financial year, there were no differences impacting the Group between the standards used and the standards adopted by the IASB that are mandatory for the financial year presented. The accounting principles applied remain unchanged from the previous year, except for the adoption of the following texts, applied since August 1[st], 2021: ▪ Amendments to IFRS 16 “1Covid-19- related rent concessions beyond June 30[th], 2021” The Group has thus continued to apply the simplification measure in paragraph 46A of IFRS 16 related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The amount recognised in net income as of 31 July 2022 amounts to €0.3 million (see note 6.1.4. Other purchases and external charges). ▪ Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Reform of benchmark interest rates – Phase 2. The reform of reference interest rates has no significant impact on the Group's accounts. Furthermore, in December 2020, the IFRS IC initiated a discussion on the periods of service to which an entity attributes benefits for a particular defined benefit plan. On this point, the IFRS IC issued the final decision "" Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service (IAS 19 Employee Benefits) "" on May 24[th], 2021. The committee stated that under the standard, the vesting period should be the period immediately before retirement age and is capped at the number of consecutive years of service defined for the plan. The method historically applied by the Group is to linearise the vesting period between the date of entry into the scheme and the date of retirement. The impact related to the application of this interpretation amounts to €416 thousand as of July 31[st], 2022 and has been recognised in equity. Finally, in April 2021, the IASB Board validated the final decision issued in March 2021 by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) on the recognition of software configuration and customisation costs under a SaaS contract. The analysis work carried out for the 2021-2022 financial year has concluded that this decision will have no significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The other standards, amendments or interpretations do not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended on July 31[st], 2022. ----- ##### 4.1.2. Standards, interpretations, and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved or in the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet mandatory as of July 31st, 2022 The Group has elected not to apply in advance the following standards and interpretations. The impact of the application of the following amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently being assessed. ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of accounting policies ▪ Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of accounting estimates ▪ Amendments to IFRS 3 References to the IFRS conceptual framework ▪ Amendments to IAS 16 Property, plant, and equipment – Proceeds before intended use ▪ Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract ▪ Annual improvements to IFRS: 2018-2020 cycle ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – Classification of liabilities as current or non-current – Deferral of effective date to January 2023. ▪ Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction. 4.2. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control. Rounding may in some cases result in immaterial differences in the totals of the tables in the notes. 4.2.1. Consolidated entities The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, when it: ▪ has power over the investee; ▪ is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and ▪ has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits. Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the Group as a whole. 4.2.2. Associates The Group has no interests in joint ventures or associates. 4.2.3. Business combinations The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations. A business combination is defined as a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest), or generating other income from ordinary activities. Thus, a business is composed of inputs and processes, applied to those inputs, that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method: ----- ##### ▪ the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including any earn-out payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earn- out payment are recognised in profit or loss; ▪ the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by goodwill, which is recognised as an asset in the statement of financial position. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value has been determined, adjustments are recognised as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognised directly in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured: ▪ either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognised for the portion related to non-controlling interests (full goodwill method); ▪ or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method). Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognised either as adjustments to the consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the provisions of IFRS 3. In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognised in respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is reclassified to profit or loss. 4.3. Basis of valuation, judgements, and use of estimates The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS require or permit the use of the fair value option. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including the trademark), the measurement of provisions and impairment of assets, and the assumptions used to measure debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following notes: ----- |Note|Estimate|Nature of estimate| |---|---|---| |Notes 4.7, 6.2.3.3, 6.2.4.2, 6.2.2, and 6.2.1|Impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks, and intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment|At the level of individual CGUs Key assumptions used to determine value in use (discount rate, perpetual growth rate, projected cash flows)| |Notes 4.12 and 6.2.8|Inventories|Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate impairment| |Note 4.9|IFRS 16|Main assumptions used to determine lease liabilities| |Notes 4.15 and 6.6.3|Notifications, lawsuits, and disputes|Measurement of provisions and liabilities| |Notes 4.16 and 6.2.14|Employee benefits|Measurement of provisions related to employee benefits and similar| |Notes 4.18.2 and 6.1.8.4|Deferred tax|Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carry forwards and temporary differences| ##### The accounting estimates used in the presentation of the financial statements as of July 31[st],2022 and July 31[st], 2021, have been made in the context of the ""COVID-19 crisis"", which has resulted in uncertainty about the economic and financial outlook. Accordingly, the Group has considered reliable information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 4.4. Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 4.4.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognised in “Other financial income” or “Other financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of that gain or loss is also recognised in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognised in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of foreign exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in Note 4.11. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at the date the fair value was determined. 4.4.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows: ▪ items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date; ▪ items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period, as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations; ▪ differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the period are recognised in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation”. The accounts drawn up in other currencies relate to the activities of subsidiaries in Switzerland and Asia ----- ##### 4.5. Intangible assets excluding goodwill An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually within the cash- generating unit (CGU) to which they belong. ##### Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria: ▪ Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition. ▪ Prospective long-term profitability. Licences and software have useful lives of between two and four years and are amortised over the relevant period. ##### 4.6. Property, plant, and equipment 4.6.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement ##### Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the alternative method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant, and equipment. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 4.6.2. Depreciation ##### The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment held: Property, plant, and equipment Useful life Depreciation method Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line Fixtures and fittings 6 to 10 years Straight line Transport equipment 3 to 4 years  Straight line Industrial machinery and equipment 3 to 10 years Straight line Technical equipment under finance leases  3 to 10 years Straight line Other property, plant, and equipment 3 to 5 years Straight line 4.7. Impairment of non-current assets (IAS 36) Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, CGUs or groups of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from unfavourable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used as of the acquisition date. |Property, plant, and equipment|Useful life|Depreciation method| |---|---|---| |Buildings Fixtures and fittings Transport equipment Industrial machinery and equipment Technical equipment under finance leases Other property, plant, and equipment|10 to 20 years 6 to 10 years 3 to 4 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 5 years|Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line| ----- ##### Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on projections of expected future cash flows, considering the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalisation in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs, the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items” in the income statement. Impairment losses recognised in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may be reversed later if the recoverable amount comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another method is deemed more pertinent. 4.8. Operations discontinued, sold, or held for sale Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated first to goodwill and then to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well as gains and losses on subsequent measurement are recognised in profit or loss. Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortised or depreciated. Operations discontinued, sold, or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that: ▪ represents a separate activity or geographical area; ▪ is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area; or ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale. The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period. ----- ##### 4.9. Leases The Group as lessee Leases giving the lessee control over the use of an identified asset for a given period in exchange for consideration fall within the scope of IFRS 16. The Group’s lessee companies recognise all leases, regardless of their nature, whether operating or finance leases, in the form of a right-of-use asset in exchange for a lease liability. The lease liability is initially determined on the basis of the present value of lease payments unpaid as of that date, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or at the incremental borrowing rate specific to the country, terms and currency of the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable payments based on a benchmark or rate and payments arising from options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. After the initial measurement, the lease liability is reduced by the payments made and increased by the interest expense. It is remeasured to reflect any change in future lease payments in the event of further negotiations with the lessor, a change in a benchmark or rate, or if options are reassessed. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or recognised in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero in the case of a reduction in the scope of leases. The right-of-use asset determined at the outset includes the initial lease liability, the initial direct costs, any leasehold rights, and any obligations to renovate the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessor. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. In the income statement, depreciation expense is recognised in operating profit or loss, and interest expense in financial income or expense. The tax impact of this consolidation restatement is taken into account through the recognition of deferred taxes. The lease term used corresponds to the non-cancellable period, to periods covered by an extension option whose exercise is reasonably certain, and to periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise is reasonably certain, taking into account the economics of the lease (and not only the legal characteristics), as well as the impact of any non-removable fixtures and fittings related to the lease that could constitute an incentive to exercise a renewal option. The Group applies: ▪ the exemptions permitted by IFRS 16 for leases with a term of less than 12 months or where the underlying asset is of low value (less than €5,000); ▪ the amendment relating to rent concessions (see note 6.1.4.“Other purchases and external expenses”). The Group as lessor The Group has leases that are subleased to third parties (mainly franchisees). As lessor, the Group classifies its leases as operating or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, and otherwise as an operating lease. For finance leases, the Group recognises the amount of the net investment as a financial receivable and derecognises the right-of-use asset of the related lease. Any difference between the right-of-use asset ----- ##### and the net investment in the sublease agreement is recognised in profit or loss. The lease liability of the main lease is maintained as a liability. A lease is classified as an operating lease if the classification criteria (described above) are not met. For operating leases, the lease payments are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 4.10. Other financial assets In accordance with the principles of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are recognised and measured either at amortised cost, at fair value through equity or at fair value through profit or loss based on the following two criteria: ▪ an initial criterion relating to the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of each instrument. The analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to determine whether these flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (the so-called SPPI test or Solely Payment of Principal and Interest); ▪ a second criterion relating to the business model used by the company to manage its financial assets. IFRS 9 defines three different business models: (i) a first business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, (ii) a second model whose economic objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling financial assets, and (iii) “other” business models. Identifying the business model and analysing the characteristics of the contractual cash flows requires judgement to ensure that financial assets are classified in the appropriate category. Where the financial asset is an investment in an equity instrument and is not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present the gains and losses on this investment in other comprehensive income. Except for trade receivables, which are measured in accordance with their transaction price within the meaning of IFRS 15, financial assets are, upon initial recognition, measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. At each balance sheet date, financial assets measured at amortised cost or at fair value through equity (recyclable) are subject to impairment testing based on the method used to estimate expected credit losses. Financial assets also include derivative financial instruments that are valued at fair value in accordance with the standards. 4.11. Derivatives In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet in other current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and carried at fair value as of the transaction date. Change in the fair value of derivative instruments is always recognised in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied. Hedge accounting is applied only if the following conditions are met: ▪ a hedging relationship is clearly identified, formalized, and documented from the date of implementation; ----- ##### ▪ the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated on a prospective and retrospective basis. The results thus obtained must be within a confidence interval of between 80% and 125%. Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair value. The effective portion is recognised in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in profit or loss. 4.12. Inventories Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens products (held as part of the Group’s central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly owned stores (consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products). Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any unsold items to align them with their realisable values. Inventories held in stores are subject to impairment, in accordance with the following rules: ▪ 20% for products unsold for more than one year ▪ 40% for products unsold for more than two years ▪ 80% for products unsold for more than three years ▪ 100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer marketed 4.13. Other current assets and liabilities 4.13.1. Trade receivables and other current assets Trade receivables are initially recognised at their transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost less expected losses over the life of the receivable according to the simplified model provided for in IFRS 9, as they do not include a significant financing component given the short payment terms. The assessment of expected credit losses is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age, as well as the financial analysis of debtors for material receivables. Receivables relating to the central payment and purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. Other current assets chiefly include receivables in respect of the central payment activity, including franchisees’ payments for their purchases from the referenced suppliers, as well as the discounts granted by such suppliers to franchisees, to be passed on to franchisees. The assessment of expected credit losses on other current assets is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age. 4.13.2. Trade payables and other current liabilities Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at amortised cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity, including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers, to be passed on to franchisees. ----- ##### 4.14. Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held to meet short- term cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in assets in the balance sheet less bank overdrafts, presented in financial liabilities. 4.15. Provisions and contingent liabilities A contingent liability is: ▪ a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or ▪ a present obligation arising from past events, but which is not recognised because: - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. A provision is recognised when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including rental expenses, taxes, and related expenses), less any sublease income. 4.16. Employee benefits and similar Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes. Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. These plans and termination benefits are subject to an actuarial valuation by independent actuaries each year for the most important plans and at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account the level of future remuneration, the probable length of service of employees, life expectancy and staff turnover. Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit plans are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income. ----- ##### Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognised in income from ordinary activities. Reductions, settlements, and past service costs are recognised in income from ordinary activities. The provision recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair value of plan assets. 4.17. Borrowings 4.17.1. Loans and other financial liabilities The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying amount of a financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest date to re-pricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability. Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at amortised cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk. Hedging relationships are described in Note 4.11 “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are recognised as an expense immediately. 4.17.2. Compound instruments Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognised in shareholders’ equity and in loans and financial liabilities, based on their respective weighting, in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption), discounted at the market rate (considering the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination) of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or redeemable for shares. The portion recognised in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected disbursements over the term of the loan to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan recorded in borrowings. 4.18. Taxes 4.18.1. Current taxes The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its income is taxable. The Group recognises the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. ----- ##### 4.18.2. Deferred tax In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognised in profit or loss for the year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is also recognised directly in equity. A deferred tax liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary difference is reversed, or if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carry forwards and tax credits are limited to the estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end of the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 4.19. Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current Given the main activities of the Group, it has been considered that the criterion for classification as current or non-current is the time taken to realise the asset or to pay the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current if more than 12 months. 4.20. Revenue recognition The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services: ▪ Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged to franchisees. Revenue is recognised as and when control of the service is transferred over the duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognised on the date on which the underlying sale occurs. ▪ Network sales revenues include sales of lenses, contact lenses and frames to franchisees through the Group’s central purchasing structure. These sales of products trademarked Alain Afflelou are recognised on the date of transfer of control to exclusive distributors and franchisees. Referral, del credere and distribution commissions to referenced suppliers and finder’s fees are accounted for as and when sales are made. ▪ Revenues from directly owned stores: retail sales of directly owned stores operating under the “Alain Afflelou” and “Optical Discount” banners, and sales resulting from the “Alain Afflelou Acousticien” hearing aid activity. Revenue is recognised on the date of transfer of control. The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted. 4.21. Cost of purchases The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely: ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass frames; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass lenses; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of contact lenses; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of accessories and other goods; ▪ Change in inventories of all of the above purchases; ▪ Direct communication costs. ----- ##### 4.22. Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other non-current operating items”. Other operating income and expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include: ▪ restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures; ▪ impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognised primarily following impairment testing of cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill; ▪ capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation or from the acquisition or disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; ▪ major disputes. These items, excluded from operating income due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as part of operating income from the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events that are both limited in scope and very unusual. 4.23. Operating profit Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”. ##### 5. Segment reporting ##### 5.1. Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography into three areas, namely “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries”. The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central purchasing unit, a central listing and payment unit, and directly owned stores. The “France” segment also includes an audio business operated under a master franchise agreement. The Group has replicated the established organisation of its French operations in Spain and aims ultimately to repeat this process in the “Other countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment notably includes Belgium, Switzerland, and Portugal. This segment includes a central purchasing unit in Belgium, and has only a few directly owned stores, in Portugal. The segment reporting presented here was prepared based on the internal reporting data reviewed by the Chairman, the Group’s “chief operating decision maker” within the meaning of IFRS 8, who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them. Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial indicators used to measure segment performance are adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. These two indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note and are reconciled with operating income from ordinary activities. ----- ##### Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in “Other countries”: ▪ The trading subsidiary specialising in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB); ▪ The Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds international supplier contracts for the entire Group. The trading activity (AAB) and international supplier contract activity (AAI) impact the entire Group. The geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the “Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the results of these trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following allocation key: ▪ The result of the AAB trading subsidiary in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating country of franchisees in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames delivered to them during the year; ▪ Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognised as revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers. The chief operating decision maker does not review a geographical breakdown of information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities. Information on the Group’s various activities and services is provided in Note 1.2, Note 4.20 on revenue recognition, and Note 6.1.1 on revenue by activity. 31/07/2022 31/07/2021 (in thousands of euros) (12 months) (12 months) France 293,501 276,844 Spain 74,538 72,899 Other countries 15,769 15,512 Revenue 383,808 365,255 France 87,993 81,006 Spain 15,467 16,295 Other countries 3,483 3,375 Adjusted EBITDA 106,943 100,676 France (19,881) (15,922) Spain (7,296) (5,714) Other countries (570) (132) Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment (27,748) (21,767) France 68,250 64,517 Spain 8,170 10,441 Other countries 2,913 3,244 Adjusted EBIT  79,333 78,202 France 841,429 819,721 Spain 128,597 136,229 Other countries 18,750 19,390 Fixed assets (1) 988,776 975,340 (1) including GW, Trademarks, Intangible and tangible assets and Right of use |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2022|31/07/2021| |---|---|---| ||(12 months)|(12 months)| |France Spain Other countries|293,501 74,538 15,769|276,844 72,899 15,512| |Revenue|383,808|365,255| |France Spain Other countries|87,993 15,467 3,483|81,006 16,295 3,375| |Adjusted EBITDA|106,943|100,676| |France Spain Other countries|(19,881) (7,296) (570)|(15,922) (5,714) (132)| |Depreciation, amortisation, and impairment|(27,748)|(21,767)| |France Spain Other countries|68,250 8,170 2,913|64,517 10,441 3,244| |Adjusted EBIT|79,333|78,202| |France Spain Other countries|841,429 128,597 18,750|819,721 136,229 19,390| |Fixed assets (1)|988,776|975,340| ----- ##### 5.2. Reconciliation of adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA with operating income from ordinary activities Adjusted EBIT is defined as operating income from ordinary activities as presented in the Group’s consolidated financial statements before the impact of shareholders’ management fees and management bonuses.

In the year ended July 31[st], 2021, financial income amounted to €2,053 thousand and was of the same nature. The decrease in interest on convertible bonds is mainly due to the significant reduction in the outstanding amount of these convertible bonds because of the redemption of €135 million in May 2021 as part of the Group's refinancing and the further redemption of €11.5 million and conversion into shares of €140 million of convertible bonds in January 2022. On the other hand, the refinancing in May 2021 and the additional debt of €50 million raised in January 2022 generated additional interest on bonds. As of July 31[st],2021, other financial expenses related to debt of €3,378 thousand were mainly composed of early repayment penalties on the historic loan for €2,500 thousand. Miscellaneous financial expenses of €3,223 thousand as of July 31[st], 2022, are mainly related to foreign exchange losses.

The potentially dilutive shares correspond to: shares granted under the convertible bonds issued at the time of the Group's refinancing on July 17th, 2012, which include convertible bonds into shares (OCAs), i.e., potentially 11,926,848 shares; and shares granted, which include Mezzanine Class A warrants, i.e., potentially 6,596,000 shares, and Mezzanine Class B warrants, i.e., potentially 9,520,000 shares. The instruments issued by the Group had no dilutive effect on the 2021 and 2022 financial years. The maximum number of shares that could become potentially dilutive in a subsequent year is 28,042,848 shares. 6.2. Notes to the balance sheet 6.2.1.

This resulted in the valuation of the Alain Afflelou trademark at €650 million as part of the accounting for the takeover pursuant to IFRS 3. Given the scheduled shutdown of the franchisor's activities for the Optical Discount brand at the end of 2024, the Group recognized an additional impairment of €2,544 thousand as of July 31[st], 2022, on the Optical Discount trademark, reducing the latter to a zero value. ##### 6.2.3.

Impairment testing of non-current intangible assets 6.2.6.1. Nature of impairment testing The Group first tests the assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores, then trademarks and ultimately goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs. Impairment testing of assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores is performed on a store- by-store basis, based on the estimated market value. When in the course of negotiations the Group has indicative offers, it uses them to measure the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the probable selling price, calculated on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each store adjusted for the effects of the COVID period, in line with potential market conditions. In 2016, the original goodwill has been allocated to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not on its own account generate cash flows substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The Optical Discount and Malentille.com trademarks and goodwill have been allocated to the “France” operating segment. 6.2.6.2. Impairment testing methodology within groups of CGUs – Estimates for the calculation of value in use Future cash flow projections are made based on budgets and medium-term business plans. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. The key assumptions other than the five-year business plan established by the Group are described below. |(in thousands of euros)|01/08/2021|Depreciation and Disposals, Other Change in amortisation transfers movements scope and provisions|31/07/2022| |---|---|---|---| |France Spain Other countries|(52,938) (26,492) (1,077)|(8,607) 3,855 (22) (1,112) (4,293) 2,264 (1) (564) 68 1|(58,824) (28,522) (1,572)| |Total depreciation and impairment|(80,507)|(13,465) 6,187 (22) (1,112)|(88,918)| |(in thousands of euros)|01/08/2021|Other Change Acquisitions Repayment Decrease movements in scope|31/07/2022| |---|---|---|---| |Long-term sublease receivables Short-term sublease receivables|14,320 3,001|4,968 6 (744) (2,900) 27 221 (2,890) (316) 3,034 3|15,677 3,052| |Gross total|17,321|5,189 (2,884) (1,060) 134 29|18,729| ----- ##### 6.2.6.3. Impairment testing results Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2022 revealed values in use more than the net asset value of the France, Spain, and Other countries CGUs. A 5.0% variation in adjusted EBITDA in 2023, projected over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of approximately €46 million on the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €7 million of the Spain CGU and €2 million of the Other countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of July 31[st], 2022. The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the France and Other countries CGUs are 9.5% and 1.5% respectively. The discount rates and the perpetual growth rates for the Spain CGU are 10% and 1.5% respectively. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of a 1 percentage point increase or decrease in the perpetual growth rate and the discount rate used for goodwill impairment testing as of July 31[st], 2022. It did not reveal any impact on the loss recognised in respect of 2022 for the France, Spain, or Other countries CGUs. 6.2.7.

No dividends were paid in respect of fiscal 2021 in 2022. 6.2.14. Employee benefits and similar These benefits primarily cover retirement allowances in France. Retirement allowances in France In France, the retirement allowance is a lump sum paid to employees when they retire. The amount depends on the length of the individual’s service as of the date of retirement. It is determined based on collective and/or company agreements. The plan does not entitle employees to any allowance until they reach retirement age (unvested). Retirement allowances are not linked to other standard pension benefits such as pensions paid by Social Security or supplementary pension funds (ARRCO and AGIRC). The assumptions used by the collecting body are as follows: ▪ Mortality table: TF-TH 14/16, ▪ Rules governing retirement allowances: from the national collective agreement for eyewear retail, ▪ Retirement age: ``` o 63 years for the Manager category, o 62 years (franchisor) and 63 years (directly owned stores) for the Technician category, o 62 years for the Worker/Employee category, ▪ Type of retirement: voluntary departure. ``` |Assumptions|31/07/2022|31/07/2021| |---|---|---| |Rate of employers’ contributions (franchisor) Rate of employers’ contributions (directly owned stores) Rate of wage increases (franchisor) Rate of wage increases (directly owned stores) Rate of staff turnover (franchisor) Rate of staff turnover (directly owned stores) Discount rate|46.4% 37.0% 2.4% 2.5% 6.6% 12.0% 2.8%|46,8% 42,0% 3,2% 2,4% 8,5% 14,4% 0,7%| ----- ##### Actuarial gains and losses were recognised in “Other comprehensive income” in accordance with IAS 19R in the amount of €247 thousand net of deferred taxes in fiscal 2022 and the amount of €11 thousand net of deferred taxes in fiscal 2021. Defined benefit plans account for the total gain of €29 thousand in fiscal 2022 (€158 thousand in 2021). Furthermore, in December 2020, the IFRS IC initiated a discussion on the periods of service to which an entity attributes benefits for a particular defined benefit plan. On this point, the IFRS IC issued the final decision ""Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service (IAS 19 Employee Benefits)"" on 24 May 2021. The committee stated that under the standard, the vesting period should be the period immediately before retirement age and is capped at the number of consecutive years of service defined for the plan. The method historically applied by the Group is to linearise the vesting period between the date of entry into the scheme and the date of retirement. The impact of € 416 thousand net of tax on July 31[st], 2022, was recognised in equity. Mandatory supplementary pensions (LPP) in Switzerland The pension plan is affiliated with a collective foundation. The foundation bears the investment and longevity risk, and transfers some of the risk to an insurance company. The Group has no liabilities in respect of medical expenses. 6.2.15.

This is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements, with a term of 54 months from May 2021. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate combining Euribor and a margin, the margin being calculated based on a leverage ratio. A non-use commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU and 3ABOD have been pledged as collateral, as have the securities of potential borrowing subsidiaries (3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the RCF would not generate penalties. Reporting obligations are the same as those of bond lenders. The Group must also certify, period-by- period, that the adjusted EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) of the prior 12 months is above €58 million.

Interest on the OCA is capitalised (the first capitalisation took place on 31 July 2013), and payment will be made either on the date of redemption or the date of conversion. The maturity of the convertible bonds has been extended from July 2027 to November 2027. Conversion is possible at any time, based on one share for one bond. Early redemption is possible at the issuer’s initiative, subject to the conditions of the subordination agreement, or, at the holder’s initiative, subject to compliance with the terms of the subordination agreement, in case of change of control or IPO. Equity component of convertible bonds The convertible bonds were recorded as debt and as equity. As of the date of issue, in accordance with IAS 32, the debt component was measured by discounting the value of the contractual cash flows of the convertible debt at an estimated market rate of 17% (see Note 4.17.2).

The Group’s position in relation to interest rate risk ##### The Group’s policy is to ensure that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or, for floating rate borrowings, to contract derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows attributable to interest rate risk. At the end of 2021, the Group hedged €50 million maturing in 2025, on the basis of a maximum variable rate indexed to Euribor at 0.50%. Given the rapid rise in interest ----- ##### rates, the fair value of the financial instrument for €1 million as of July 31, 2022, was recognized in equity. 6.3.2. The Group’s position in relation to currency risk Other than from its purchasing activity with its supplier OKIA, the Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases, which are predominantly denominated is US dollars. To that end, the Group has established agreements on purchasing conditions with OKIA, its main supplier, based on a fixed dollar/euro exchange rate. A derivative embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate compared with the rate set in the contract to be shared equally between the two parties. As part of the budget process, the Group identified the risks associated with a deterioration in the dollar/euro exchange rate for the coming year. Lastly, it has ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an appreciation of the dollar against the euro. 6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held by the Group. The Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in del credere commissions. 6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million revolving credit facility, undrawn as of July 31st, 2022, to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed bank overdraft and discounted trade receivables. In addition, the Group periodically reviews the assumptions of its multi-year business plan. The development and net cash flow generation objectives (after investment and financing operations) have been reviewed in this context and take into account the changing environment in terms of the financing of groups under LBO. 6.3.5. Establishment of a full risk map In addition to the above-mentioned risks, the group has set up a complete mapping of the risks to which it is exposed during the past financial year. This project was implemented with the assistance of Grant Thornton. It led to the identification of 11 main risks for the Group. Following this first phase, the persons responsible for monitoring each of the risks were designated, the objective being both to anticipate their possible occurrence and to prepare actions to remedy or deal with them. For example, the Group has set up a unit to monitor inflationary risk and the consumer environment, with a threefold objective: to identify the warning signs of the impact of inflationary shocks on consumption (traffic in shops, sales volumes, observed prices), to anticipate future offers designed to counteract the impact of inflation, and to support the entire network in dealing with it. ----- ##### 6.4.

The Group’s medium-term external borrowings (high-yield bonds traded on the Irish Stock Exchange) belong to the Level 1 category; Level 2 category for hedging instruments and all other financial instruments belong to the Level 3 category.

These guarantees also include commitments to purchase six stores from one franchisee (compared with three franchisees as of July 31[st], 2021), for which advanced discussions of substitution by other franchisees are underway, as well as guarantees given in the context of obtaining vendor credit from franchisees. Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital. Secured loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its capacity as guarantor to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of 100% of each application for financing, with in certain cases a maximum portion of the overall package. Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and guarantees made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts of the central payment structure. In addition, the Group benefits from commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees. Under franchise agreements, franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the Group for the obligations and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure. These guarantees are generally prorated at 30% of annual net revenue in France and Spain. However, only guarantees and sureties related to franchisees’ specific debts (agreements, staggered payments, vendor loans) are shown in the table of commitments received. Moreover, in conjunction with the refinancing of its borrowings, the Group has given the following commitments: ▪ debt guaranteed by 3ABOD, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, LOA, LSFA, AAI and 3ABOE; ▪ pledge of the shares of 3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, LSFA, 3ABOE and AAI, as well as the main bank accounts of the subsidiaries; ▪ pledge of partners’ current accounts with the aforementioned subsidiaries. |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2022 31/07/2021| |---|---| |Cash and cash equivalents Bank overdrafts|55,373 38,657 (94) (100)| |Total|55,279 38,557| |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2021|31/07/2022|1 to 5 > 5 < 1 year years years| |---|---|---|---| |Lease commitments – operating leases Sundry guarantees to third parties Securities and bank guarantees – Spain Securities and bank guarantees – France|42 20,396 9,471 5,509|213 15,239 8,729 2,457|172 41 7,088 8,110 42 2,420 5,623 686 1,346 1,111 0| |Commitments given|35,418|26,638|11,026 14,884 728| |Guarantees related to businesses sold by the Group Liabilities related to the central payment structure Securities and bank guarantees - Other countries|7,633 5,544 1,674|7,188 4,332 973|1,132 3,231 2,825 1,571 2,372 389 0 973 0| |Commitments received|14,851|12,493|2,703 6,576 3,214| ----- ##### 6.6.2. Dependence of the Group on patents, licences, and supply contracts The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses, or supply contracts. 6.6.3. Notifications, lawsuits, and disputes Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of their business, including disputes with tax, social security, or customs authorities. Notification of VAT deductibility On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities amounted to €1.5 million. Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal adjustment of €1 million and 0.5 million in penalties and interest for late payment. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The decision The French administrative tribunal of Paris rejected our claim on April 6, 2022. The Group has since decided to claim on this decision before the French administrative court of Appeal which is still pending. The Group also called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1 million. Other tax disputes involving corporate income tax Following a tax audit launched in 2015 covering the period from August 1[st], 2009, to July 31[st], 2012, the French tax authorities issued an initial tax reassessment notice primarily reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss-making subsidiaries in 2010, claiming that the sale price would have had to be higher for it to be considered at arm’s length. The company and its legal and tax advisors believe that there are strong arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities. If, however, the arguments of the tax authorities were to prevail, the potential amount of the adjustment would be €21 million on the tax base. Verification of supplier payment terms On 21 September 2020, DIRECCTE initiated an inspection in connection with the commitment made by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur to comply with the legal payment terms formulated at the time of its application for a government-guaranteed loan. On 2 March 2021, the company submitted its comments on the payment terms monitored by DIRECCTE for the period from 1 June 2020 to 31 August 2020 and produced all documents in support of these observations. After a hearing on 2 March 2021, DIRECCTE drew up a report of the statement and took copies of the documents. At this stage, DIRECCTE has not followed up on this hearing. ----- ##### 6.7.

Nanterre AFFLELOU ##### Deloitte & Associés  6, place de la Pyramide 92908 Paris-La Défense Cedex S.A.S. au capital de 2 188 160 € 572 028 041 RCS Nanterre ##### Year ended 31 July 2021 Statutory auditors report on the consolidated financial statements To the of shareholders of Afflelou: Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Afflelou for the year ended July 31, 2O21. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at July 31, 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. ##### Basis for Opinion  **Audit Framework ##### We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.  **Independence ##### We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from August 1, 2020 to the date of our report. ----- ##### Justification of Assessments ##### Due to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits. It is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823- 9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the assessments that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. Impairment tests on trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are performed in accordance with the method described in Note 6.2.6 to the consolidated financial statements. We assessed the appropriateness of the method implemented based on a range of estimates and examined the data and assumptions used by the Group in performing these tests. On this basis, we assessed the reasonableness of these estimates. ##### Specific verifications ##### We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the President’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and tits consistency with the consolidated financial statements. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  In preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the President. ##### Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements ----- ##### Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, ##### whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit ##### procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting ##### estimates and related disclosures made by Management in the consolidated financial statements. - Assesses the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, ##### based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether ##### these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or ##### business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Overview ##### 1.1. General information on the parent company The parent company, AFFLELOU, is a French joint stock company controlled by LION SENECA Lux 2, headquartered at 11 rue d’Argenson, 75008 Paris. The “Group” comprises the parent company and its subsidiaries. The Chairman of AFFLELOU approved the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2021 on 5 November 2021. 1.2. General information on the Group The Group is a leader in the market for the distribution of optical products in France and Spain, and a major player in the European markets of Belgium and Switzerland. The Group also operates in various countries in Africa, Asia and America. The Group’s core business is the sale of optical and audio products through a network of franchises and directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU”, “ALAIN AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners. The Group has based its expansion strategy on the franchise network. This model is based on revenue generated by sales in franchise networks (mainly franchise fees and communication fees) and through their purchases, through services provided to the suppliers of the various brands, and through direct sales of products to franchisees, notably branded company products. The Group manages a network of 1,449 stores, of which 160 are directly owned, with the aim of (i) retaining control over flagship stores located in strategic areas and key geographies, (ii) testing new business initiatives and identifying best practices before applying them to the franchisees, (iii) managing the overall store network by temporarily piggy-backing stores that are at the end of a franchise agreement or experiencing difficulties, thereby keeping them within the Group, and (iv) facilitating negotiations with suppliers thanks to the volume of purchases from the networks. Finally, the Group derives part of its revenue from the e-commerce channel, notably with the afflelou.com, malentille.com and opticaldiscount.com websites. ##### 2. Highlights ##### 2.1. Change in the networks The Group operated a network of 1,449 stores (1,351 optical stores and 98 audio stores) as of 31 July 2021, compared with 1,429 stores (1,336 optical stores and 93 audio stores) as of 31 July 2020. Twenty stores joined our networks last year, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and further streamlining of the Optical Discount network. The portfolio of 98 audio stores is complemented by 298 spaces in optical stores in France and Spain, bringing the total of audio outlets to 396, compared with 355 as of 31 July 2020. ----- ##### As of 31 July 2021, the Group operated in 18 countries, split into three zones: France with 965 points of sale, Spain with 342 points of sale, and other countries representing 142 points of sale. As of 31 July 2021, the Group had a portfolio of 160 directly owned stores, located chiefly in France and Spain, compared with 151 stores as of 31 July 2020. 2.2. Change in the Group’s debt Given the very satisfactory performance of the network and the rapid recovery of the business after the first period of lockdown from March to May 2020, the Group continued to deleverage over the last year. To that end, and in view of a well-oriented debt market, it was decided to repay the Group’s financial debt before maturity by refinancing its external debt (high-yield bonds) maturing in 2023. The Group’s refinancing was carried out at parent company level on 19 May 2021, via the issue of two bond tranches, one of €410 million, at a fixed rate of 4.25% per annum, maturing in May 2026, and the other, subordinated to the first, of €75 million, at the floating rate of EURIBOR +8% per annum, maturing in May 2027. This new debt, replacing the previous external debt of €415 million, together with the Group’s cash position as of that date, also permitted the early redemption of €135 million of convertible bonds held by the Group’s shareholders. The Group also went ahead with the early repayment of the €30 million government-guaranteed loan when it issued the new bonds. As in the past, the new debt includes a revolving credit facility (RCF) of €30 million with a maturity of 4.5 years at the floating rate of EURIBOR +3% if drawn (with a possible downward revision of margins depending on leverage). These transactions stabilized the Group’s medium-term resources while allowing the early redemption of €135 million of convertible bonds held by shareholders. 2.3. Implementation of the 100% Santé scheme for full refund of hearing aids in France The audio sector was marked by the implementation of the final stage of regulatory changes related to the 100% Santé scheme. Since 1 January 2021, the final stage has resulted in segment 1 audio equipment being provided completely free of charge under the “reste à charge 0” scheme (RAC0, for zero out-of-pocket expenses), the cost of which had been gradually reduced in 2019 and 2020. This is a major change, more so than in optics, ushering in access to segment 1 equipment completely free of charge, as has been the case in optics since January 2020, but starting from a much higher historical average cost (around 1,500 euros). A large part of this cost was previously borne by the end customer, even after compulsory refunds (social security) and those from top-up insurance. The impact has been considerable in the hearing aid market, with volumes of equipment dispensed by suppliers more than doubling in the first six months of 2021 compared with the previous two years. Similarly, the ALAIN AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN network recorded a substantial increase in trading compared with the same period in 2019, before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Segment 1 devices have accounted for more than a third of equipment sold since the beginning of the year, with no out-of-pocket expenses for the end user. ----- ##### 2.4. COVID-19 epidemic At the end of the 2019 calendar year, a new strain of coronavirus was detected in Wuhan, China, before spreading to Europe, and notably our two main countries, France and Spain. In March 2020, the World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic, and public authorities worldwide adopted measures to limit the spread of the virus. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the Group’s business for much of the year ended 31 July 2021. The year was marked by an initial phase of very strong momentum, as stores reopened after the initial period of lockdown. This had triggered a swift and near total shutdown of our operations, more than 99% of which were carried out in the stores of our networks, over a period of almost two months from mid-March to mid-May. Until the end of October 2020, our networks recorded strong momentum (15% increase in sales during the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year), reflecting a massive catch-up of sales deferred during the first period of lockdown. This momentum was slowed by a fresh period of lockdown, primarily in November 2020. Most businesses were closed in our main locations during this period, although optical and audio stores were deemed to be essential services, and were accordingly allowed to remain open. Despite this, trading slowed in our networks. This was particularly so in shopping centres, which saw a significant drop in footfall. It was also the case in a subsequent period of restrictions from mid-January, during which restrictive measures were imposed on stores located in shopping centres, mainly in France. These restrictions ran until mid-May in France. At the height of this episode, closures affected more than 150 points of sale and the equivalent of 20% of legacy sales, all networks combined. In the final months of the year ended 31 July 2021, the Group returned to slightly higher levels of trading than in the year ended 31 July 2020, while also benefiting from the exceptional momentum in the hearing aid business since the beginning of calendar 2021. The Group continued to manage its work in respect of the network and end customers in the changing climate stemming from the pandemic as it had done during the previous fiscal year. From a financial perspective, the advances of approximately €25.7 million made to franchisees at the end of July 2020 were repaid regularly and represented less than €0.2 million at the end of the year, including one-off assistance made during successive periods of restrictions. Our network of franchisees and our directly owned store network also benefited from French government support aimed at reducing the impact of restrictions affecting shopping centres. The Group benefited from the following French government support measures: ▪ €0.6 million in aid from the “solidarity fund”; ▪ €1 million in so-called “fixed cost” EBITDA aid; ▪ €1 million in benefits for furloughed employees. In addition, the Group benefited from rental credits in the amount of €1,087 thousand in fiscal 2021, compared with €453 thousand in fiscal 2020 (see note 6.1.4. Other purchases and external expenses). 2.5. Change in the Group’s governance On 13 November 2020, the Group’s General Shareholders’ Meeting appointed Marelle Partners company represented by Rachel Marouani as Chairwoman of the Board of Directors, replacing Didier Pascual. On 21 December 2020, Didier Pascual was dismissed from his duties as Director and Chairman of the Company. On the same date, Royal Advisory, represented by Tarek Hosni, was appointed as a director on the Board of Directors and Chair of AFFLELOU, replacing Didier Pascual. ----- ##### Finally, on 20 May 2021, Alain Pourcelot assumed his duties in replacement of Royal Advisory represented by Tarek Hosni, which had resigned, as a director on AFFLELOU’s Board of Directors and Chairman of the AFFLELOU Group, a position he held on the date of publication of these consolidated financial statements. ##### 3. Change in the scope of consolidation ##### 3.1. Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2021 On 29 October 2020, L’OPTICIEN AFFLELOU took control of OTTICA by acquiring 100% of its shares for €1,430 thousand. OTTICA operates an optical eyewear store in the Auchan shopping centre in Semécourt (57280). In July 2021, ARKANIA VISION was merged into AAO and OFE was merged into AAE. Both companies were fully consolidated as of 31 July 2020. 3.2. Change in the scope of consolidation in fiscal 2020 Following its acquisition on 31 July 2019, AAOC MAG, owner and operator of six stores, was merged into L’opticien Afflelou (LOA) on 31 January 2020. As a result of this merger, AA OC MAG was wound up without liquidation with retroactive effect from the first day of the fiscal year, i.e. 1 August 2019. In addition, Tchin Management 3 was merged into AFFLELOU on 31 January 2020. Finally, the Group acquired Spanish company ARKANIA VISION, operating one store, in July 2020. ##### 4. Accounting policies ##### 4.1. Standards and rules applied The Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2021 were prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards issued by the IASB (International Accounting Standards Board) and adopted by the European Union under Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 dated 19 July 2002. These standards include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Accounting Standards (IAS), as well as interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC), as approved in the European Union, application of which was mandatory as of the year under review, which are available on the website of the European Commission (https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32009R0069). The accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2020, with the exception of new standards, amendments and interpretations applicable in financial years beginning on or after 1 August 2020. 4.1.1. Standards, interpretations and amendments mandatory as of 1 August 2020 ▪ Amendment to IFRS 3 Definition of a business; ▪ Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 Reform of benchmark interest rates; ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of material; ▪ Amendments to references to the IFRS conceptual framework; ----- ##### ▪ Amendments to IFRS 16 COVID-19-related rent concessions and COVID-19-related rent concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (early application following adoption by the European Union on 31 August 2021). The Group has applied the simplification measure provided for in paragraph 46A of the amendments to IFRS 16 related to COVID-19. The amount recognized in net income for the year ended 31 July 2021 is €1,087 thousand (see note 6.1.4. “Other purchases and external expenses”). In addition, in December 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee initiated a discussion regarding the periods of service to which an entity grants benefits for a particular defined benefit plan. On that point, the IFRS IC issued the final decision Attributing Benefit to Periods of Service (IAS 19 Employee Benefits) on 24 May 2021. The Committee indicated that the standard required the vesting period to be the period immediately prior to the retirement age and capped it at the number of consecutive years of service defined for the plan. The method currently applied by the Group consists of levelling the acquisition of rights on a straight-line basis between the date of entry into the plan and the date of retirement. In view of the work to be carried out on the applicable collective agreements and the analysis time required to assess the potential impact of a change in method, the methodology used by the Group to measure its commitments at the 31 July 2021 closing date is unchanged. Analysis work is ongoing and will continue over the next few months of fiscal 2022. Finally, in April 2021, the IASB endorsed the final decision issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) in March 2021 regarding the recognition of the costs of configuring and customizing software under an SaaS contract. In view of the work to be carried out and the analysis time required to assess the potential impact of a change in method, the methodology used by the Group to recognize these costs at the 31 July 2021 closing date remains unchanged. The analysis work is underway and will continue over the next few months of fiscal 2022. The other standards, amendments or interpretations did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2021. 4.1.2. Standards, interpretations and amendments to standards published by IASB and approved or in the process of approval by the European Union, the application of which is not yet mandatory as of 31 July 2021 The Group has elected not to apply in advance the following standards and interpretations. The impact of the application of the following amendments and interpretations on the Group’s financial statements is currently being assessed. ▪ Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Reform of benchmark interest rates – Phase 2; ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – Classification of liabilities as current or non-current – Deferral of effective date to January 2023; ▪ Amendments to IFRS 3 References to the IFRS conceptual framework; ▪ Amendments to IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment – Proceeds before intended use; ▪ Amendments to IAS 37 Onerous contracts – Cost of fulfilling a contract; ▪ Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 Disclosure of accounting policies; ▪ Amendments to IAS 8 Definition of accounting estimates; ▪ Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction; ▪ Annual improvements to IFRS: 2018-2020 cycle. ----- ##### 4.2. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of acquired entities from the takeover date and those of disposed entities until the date of loss of control. Rounding may in some cases result in immaterial differences in the totals of the tables in the notes. 4.2.1. Consolidated entities The Group consolidates entities over which it exercises control, as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, when it: ▪ has power over the investee; ▪ is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; ▪ and has the power to govern the investee’s financial and operating policies with a view to obtaining economic benefits. Reciprocal transactions, assets and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Income derived from internal transactions with controlled companies is eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed where necessary to ensure consistency of accounting treatment across the Group as a whole. 4.2.2. Associates The Group has no interests in joint ventures or associates. 4.2.3. Business combinations The Group applies IFRS 3R Business Combinations. A business combination is defined as a transaction in which an acquirer obtains control of one or more businesses. A business is defined as an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities. Thus, a business is composed of inputs and processes, applied to those inputs, that have the ability to contribute to the creation of outputs. ##### Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method: ▪ the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including any earn-out payments, at the date of takeover. Subsequent changes in the fair value of an earn- out payment are recognized in profit or loss; ▪ the difference between the consideration transferred (acquisition price) and the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of takeover is represented by goodwill, which is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined on a provisional basis when the initial assessment or additional analysis is underway on the balance sheet date. Once fair value has been determined, adjustments are recognized as retrospective adjustments to goodwill if they occur within a maximum period of one year from the acquisition date and if they result from facts and circumstances existing as of the acquisition date. Beyond this period, such effects are recognized directly in profit or loss, as is any change in estimates. For each acquisition of an interest of less than 100%, the proportion of share capital not acquired (non-controlling interests) is measured: ▪ either at fair value: in this case, goodwill is recognized for the portion related to non-controlling interests (full goodwill method); ▪ or in accordance with its share of the revalued net assets of the acquired entity: in this case, only goodwill in respect of the acquired share is recorded (partial goodwill method). ----- ##### Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred, in “Other non-recurring operating income and expenses”. Adjustments or earn-out payments in respect of business combinations are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. They are recognized either as adjustments to the consideration transferred or through post-acquisition profit or loss depending on their nature under the provisions of IFRS 3. In a business combination achieved in stages, the interest previously held by the Group in the acquiree is remeasured at the time of the takeover of the business, at fair value through profit or loss. To determine goodwill as of the takeover date, the fair value of the consideration transferred is added to the fair value previously recorded by the Group. The amount of other comprehensive income previously recognized in respect of the interest held prior to the takeover is reclassified to profit or loss. 4.3. Basis of valuation, judgements and use of estimates The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for cases where IFRS require or permit the use of the fair value option. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions in determining the value of assets and liabilities, appraising contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and valuing income and expenses for the year. Significant estimates made by the Group in the preparation of the financial statements concern the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangible assets (including the trademark), the measurement of provisions and impairment of assets, and the assumptions used to measure debt in accordance with IFRS 16. Due to uncertainties inherent in any valuation process, the Group revises its estimates on the basis of regularly updated information. It is possible that future results could differ from such estimates. The main assumptions and estimates made by the Group are described in specific sections of the notes to the financial statements, and in particular in the following notes: Note Estimate Nature of estimate Notes 4.7, 6.2.3.3, Impairment testing of At the level of individual CGUs 6.2.4.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2 goodwill, trademarks, and Key assumptions used to determine value in use (discount rate, and 6.2.6 intangible assets and perpetual growth rate, projected cash flows) property, plant and equipment Notes 4.12 and 6.2.8 Inventories Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate impairment Note 4.9 IFRS 16 Main assumptions used to determine lease liabilities Notes 4.15, 6.2.15 Notifications, lawsuits and Measurement of provisions and liabilities and 6.6.3 disputes Notes 4.18.2 and Deferred tax Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax assets 6.1.8.3.1 relating to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences ##### The accounting estimates used in the presentation of the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2021 were made against the backdrop of the “COVID-19 crisis”, which has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the economic and financial outlook. Consequently, the Group has considered reliable information available at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. 4.4. Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 4.4.1. Accounting for transactions in foreign currencies |Note|Estimate|Nature of estimate| |---|---|---| |Notes 4.7, 6.2.3.3, 6.2.4.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2 and 6.2.6|Impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks, and intangible assets and property, plant and equipment|At the level of individual CGUs Key assumptions used to determine value in use (discount rate, perpetual growth rate, projected cash flows)| |Notes 4.12 and 6.2.8|Inventories|Prospective inventory turnover rate used to calculate impairment| |Note 4.9|IFRS 16|Main assumptions used to determine lease liabilities| |Notes 4.15, 6.2.15 and 6.6.3|Notifications, lawsuits and disputes|Measurement of provisions and liabilities| |Notes 4.18.2 and 6.1.8.3.1|Deferred tax|Assumptions used for the recognition of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences| ----- ##### Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the relevant entity’s functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at each balance sheet date using the closing exchange rate. Foreign exchange differences resulting from the settlement of such items are recognized in “Other financial income” or “Other financial expense”. When a gain or loss on a non-monetary item is recognized directly in other comprehensive income, the “exchange rate” component of the said gain or loss is also recognized in other comprehensive income. Otherwise, it is recognized in profit or loss for the period. The treatment of foreign exchange rate hedges in the form of derivatives is described under the heading “Derivatives” in Note 4.11. Non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at historical cost are translated at the transaction date, and non-monetary items in foreign currencies measured at fair value are translated at the date the fair value was determined. 4.4.2. Translation of the financial statements of foreign companies The financial statements of each of the companies consolidated by the Group are prepared in their respective functional currency, defined as the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates. The financial statements of companies whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows: ▪ items in the statement of financial position are translated into euros based on the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date; ▪ items in the income statement are translated into euros at the average exchange rate for the period, as long as it is not undermined by significant fluctuations; ▪ differences resulting from the translation of the statement of financial position as of the balance sheet date and the translation of the income statement using the average exchange rate over the period are recognized in other recyclable comprehensive income under “Currency translation”. 4.5. Intangible assets excluding goodwill An intangible asset is a non-monetary item without physical substance that must be both identifiable and controlled by the company as a result of past events. It must also generate future economic benefits. An intangible asset is identifiable if it is separable from the acquired entity or if it is derived from legal or contractual rights. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods corresponding to their anticipated useful life. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually within the cash- generating unit (CGU) to which they belong. ##### Trademarks are classified as assets with indefinite useful lives in application of the following criteria: ▪ Their overall positioning in their respective market in terms of business volumes and recognition; ▪ Prospective long-term profitability. Licences and software have useful lives of between one and four years and are amortized over the relevant period. 4.6. Property, plant and equipment ----- ##### 4.6.1. Initial valuation and subsequent measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at their historical or production cost or initial consolidation amount, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is not subject to remeasurement, as the Group has not chosen the alternative method allowing the regular remeasurement of one or more categories of property, plant and equipment. The carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 4.6.2. Depreciation The Group uses the following depreciation periods for the various items of property, plant and equipment held: Property, plant and equipment Useful life Depreciation method Buildings 10 to 20 years Straight line Industrial machinery and equipment  3 to 10 years Straight line Technical equipment under finance leases  3 to 10 years Straight line Other property, plant and equipment 3 to 5 years Straight line 4.7. Impairment of non-current assets (IAS 36) Goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and CGUs or groups of CGUs containing such items are subject to routine annual impairment testing as of 31 July each year. Impairment testing is also performed when events or circumstances indicate that goodwill, other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, CGUs or groups of CGUs may be impaired. Such events or circumstances may stem from unfavorable changes affecting either the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives used as of the acquisition date. Impairment testing serves to determine whether the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU or group of CGUs is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined based on projections of expected future cash flows, taking into account the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, CGU or group of CGUs. To calculate value in use, a terminal value equal to the capitalization in perpetuity of normative annual cash flows is added to the value of prospective future cash flows. Fair value less costs to sell is the amount that could be obtained from the sale of the asset or group of assets in an arm’s length transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties, less costs to sell. When the recoverable amount of the asset, CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized against the relevant asset or group of assets. In the case of a CGU or group of CGUs, the impairment loss is allocated first to goodwill, where appropriate, and is recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items” in the income statement. Impairment losses recognized in respect of property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets may be reversed later if the recoverable amount comes to exceed the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognized in respect of goodwill cannot be reversed. On the partial disposal of a CGU, the value of goodwill allocated to the partial divestment is measured based on the relative values of the disposed business and the portion of the CGU retained unless another method is deemed more pertinent. |Property, plant and equipment|Useful life|Depreciation method| |---|---|---| |Buildings Industrial machinery and equipment Technical equipment under finance leases Other property, plant and equipment|10 to 20 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 10 years 3 to 5 years|Straight line Straight line Straight line Straight line| ----- ##### 4.8. Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale Non-current assets or groups of assets and liabilities are classified as assets held for sale if they are highly likely to be recovered primarily through a sale rather than through continuing use. Such assets (or groups of assets held for sale) are generally recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Any impairment loss in respect of a group of assets held for sale is allocated first to goodwill and then to other assets and liabilities in proportion to their carrying amount. Impairment losses resulting from the classification of an asset (or group of assets and liabilities) as held for sale as well as gains and losses on subsequent measurement are recognized in profit or loss. Once classified as assets held for sale, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are no longer amortized or depreciated. Operations discontinued, sold or held for sale are a component of the Group’s activities that: ▪ represents a separate activity or geographical area; ▪ is part of a single, coordinated plan to dispose of a separate business or geographical area; or ▪ is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale. The classification as a discontinued, sold or held-for-sale business occurs on the date of disposal or at an earlier date when the business meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. When an activity is classified as a discontinued operation, the statement of net income and other comprehensive income is restated as if the business had met the criteria for a discontinued operation at the beginning of the comparative period. 4.9. Leases The Group as lessee Leases giving the lessee control over the use of an identified asset for a given period in exchange for consideration fall within the scope of IFRS 16. The Group’s lessee companies recognize all leases, regardless of their nature, whether operating or finance leases, in the form of a right-of-use asset in exchange for a lease liability. The lease liability is initially determined on the basis of the present value of lease payments unpaid as of that date, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or at the incremental borrowing rate specific to the country, terms and currency of the lease. Lease payments include fixed payments, variable payments based on a benchmark or rate and payments arising from options that are reasonably certain to be exercised. After the initial measurement, the lease liability is reduced by the payments made and increased by the interest expense. It is remeasured to reflect any change in future lease payments in the event of further negotiations with the lessor, a change in a benchmark or rate, or if options are reassessed. When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset or recognized in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has already been reduced to zero in the case of a reduction in the scope of leases. The right-of-use asset determined at the outset includes the initial lease liability, the initial direct costs, any leasehold rights and any obligations to renovate the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessor. ----- ##### Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. In the income statement, depreciation expense is recognized in operating profit or loss, and interest expense in financial income or expense. The tax impact of this consolidation restatement is taken into account through the recognition of deferred taxes. The lease term used corresponds to the non-cancellable period, to periods covered by an extension option whose exercise is reasonably certain, and to periods covered by a termination option whose non-exercise is reasonably certain, taking into account the economics of the lease (and not only the legal characteristics), as well as the impact of any non-removable fixtures and fittings related to the lease that could constitute an incentive to exercise a renewal option. The Group applies: ▪ the exemptions permitted by IFRS 16 for leases with a term of less than 12 months or where the underlying asset is of low value (less than €5,000); ▪ the amendment relating to rent concessions (see note 6.1.4. “Other purchases and external expenses”). The Group as lessor The Group has leases that are subleased to third parties (mainly franchisees). As lessor, the Group classifies its leases as operating or finance leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, and otherwise as an operating lease. For finance leases, the Group recognizes the amount of the net investment as a financial receivable and derecognizes the right-of-use asset of the related lease. Any difference between the right-of-use asset and the net investment in the sublease agreement is recognized in profit or loss. The lease liability of the main lease is maintained as a liability. A lease is classified as an operating lease if the classification criteria (described above) are not met. For operating leases, the lease payments are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 4.10. Other financial assets ##### In accordance with the principles of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, financial assets are recognized and measured either at amortized cost, at fair value through equity or at fair value through profit or loss based on the following two criteria: ▪ an initial criterion relating to the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of each instrument. The analysis of the characteristics of the contractual cash flows aims to determine whether these flows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal (the so-called SPPI test); ▪ a second criterion relating to the business model used by the company to manage its financial assets. IFRS 9 defines three different business models: (i) a first business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, (ii) a second model whose economic objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and by selling financial assets, and (iii) “other” business models. Identifying the business model and analyzing the characteristics of the contractual cash flows requires judgement to ensure that financial assets are classified in the appropriate category. ----- ##### Where the financial asset is an investment in an equity instrument and is not held for trading, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present the gains and losses on this investment in other comprehensive income. With the exception of trade receivables, which are measured in accordance with their transaction price within the meaning of IFRS 15, financial assets are, upon initial recognition, measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset that is not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition. At each balance sheet date, financial assets measured at amortized cost or at fair value through equity (recyclable) are subject to impairment testing based on the method used to estimate expected credit losses. Financial assets also include derivative financial instruments that are valued at fair value in accordance with the standards. 4.11. Derivatives In the course of its business, the Group may use various financial instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange and/or interest rate risk. All derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet in other current or non-current assets and liabilities, depending on their maturity and accounting classification, and carried at fair value as of the transaction date. Change in the fair value of derivative instruments is always recognized in profit or loss, except when hedge accounting is applied. The Group does not apply hedge accounting. Financial instruments classified as hedging instruments are measured in the balance sheet at their fair value. The effective portion is recognized in other comprehensive income, and the ineffective portion in profit or loss. 4.12. Inventories Inventories in the balance sheet cover inventories of eyeglass frames, contact lenses and contact-lens products (held as part of the Group’s central purchasing activity), and the inventories of directly owned stores (consisting of eyeglass frames, eyeglass lenses, contact lenses and other products). Inventories are valued at their weighted average purchase price. Inventories are impaired to cover any unsold items so as to align them with their realizable values.  Inventories held in stores are subject to impairment, in accordance with the following rules: ▪ 20% for products unsold for more than one year; ▪ 40% for products unsold for more than two years; ▪ 80% for products unsold for more than three years; ▪ 100% for products whose vendors have ceased trading and trademarks that are no longer marketed. 4.13. Other current assets and liabilities 4.13.1. Trade receivables and other current assets ----- ##### Trade receivables are initially recognized at their transaction price in accordance with IFRS 15. They are subsequently measured at amortized cost less expected losses over the life of the receivable according to the simplified model provided for in IFRS 9, as they do not include a significant financing component given the short payment terms. The assessment of expected credit losses is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age, as well as the financial analysis of debtors for material receivables. Receivables relating to the central payment and purchasing activities are included in “Other current assets”. Other current assets chiefly include receivables in respect of the central payment activity, including franchisees’ payments for their purchases from the referenced suppliers, as well as the discounts granted by such suppliers to franchisees, to be passed on to franchisees. The assessment of expected credit losses on other current assets is performed taking into account in particular the history of credit losses and their age, as well as the financial analysis of debtors for material receivables. 4.13.2. Trade payables and other current liabilities Trade payables in respect of overheads and communication and sponsorship expenses are recorded at amortized cost. Other current liabilities chiefly include payables in respect of the central payment activity, including future settlements to suppliers of franchisees, as well as any discounts granted by such suppliers, to be passed on to franchisees. 4.14. Cash and cash equivalents Cash includes cash in bank current accounts and demand deposits. Cash equivalents consist of investments maturing in less than one year from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, held in order to meet short-term cash commitments. Overdrafts are recorded as current borrowings. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, “Cash and cash equivalents” corresponds to the amount presented in assets in the balance sheet less bank overdrafts, presented in financial liabilities. 4.15. Provisions and contingent liabilities A contingent liability is: ▪ a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence (or not) of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity; or ▪ a present obligation arising from past events but which is not recognized because: - it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or - the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. ----- ##### A provision is recognized when the Group has a probable obligation arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to lead to an outflow of Group resources without an equivalent or greater incoming amount that can be estimated reliably. Identified risks of all types, including operational and financial, are subject to quarterly monitoring to determine the amount of provisions necessary. A provision for vacant retail space is recorded when a retail space is unoccupied over the residual term of the lease (including rental expenses, taxes and related expenses), less any sublease income. 4.16. Employee benefits and similar Group companies contribute, in accordance with the laws and customs of each country, to various types of benefits available to their employees. Under defined contribution plans, the Group has no obligation to make additional payments over and above the contributions already paid into a fund if the said fund does not have sufficient assets to pay benefits corresponding to services rendered by employees during the current or prior periods. Contributions to such plans are expensed as incurred. This is notably the case for the French entities in respect of statutory pension schemes. Under defined benefit plans, obligations are measured using the projected unit credit method on the basis of agreements or arrangements in force in each company. Under this method, each period of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is measured separately to obtain the final obligation. This obligation is then discounted. The actuarial assumptions used to determine the obligations vary depending on the economic conditions prevailing in the country in which the plan is established. The biggest such plans and termination payments are subject to an actuarial valuation by independent actuaries every year; valuations are performed at regular intervals for other plans. These valuations take into account the level of future compensation, the probable length of employment, life expectancy and staff turnover. Actuarial gains and losses result from changes in assumptions and the difference between estimated results based on actuarial assumptions and actual results. Actuarial gains and losses relating to defined benefit plans are recognized immediately in other comprehensive income. Expenses relating to this type of plan are recognized in income from ordinary activities. Reductions, settlements and past service costs are recognized in income from ordinary activities. The provision recognized in the balance sheet represents the present value of the obligations calculated net of the fair value of plan assets. 4.17. Borrowings 4.17.1. Loans and other financial liabilities The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Within the Group’s borrowings, trade payables and other payables are initially recognized at fair value less transaction costs, and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is determined for each transaction. It is the rate that provides the net carrying amount of a financial liability by discounting projected future cash flows paid until maturity or until the closest date to re-pricing at the market rate. This calculation includes related transaction costs and all premiums and/or discounts. Transaction costs are costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issuance of a financial liability. ----- ##### Financial liabilities classified as hedged items in hedging relationships at fair value and measured at amortized cost are subject to an adjustment to their net carrying amount in respect of the hedged risk. Hedging relationships are described in Note 4.11 “Derivatives”. Financial liabilities designated using the fair value option, other than derivative liabilities, are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in profit or loss. Transaction costs related to the implementation of such financial liabilities are expensed as incurred. 4.17.2. Compound instruments Some financial instruments comprise both a debt component and an equity component. This is notably the case for convertible bonds. The various components of these instruments are recognized in shareholders’ equity and in loans and financial liabilities, on the basis of their respective weighting, in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation. Debt components are measured at issuance. Their measurement corresponds to the value of the future cash flows (including interest and redemption), discounted at the market rate (taking into account the credit risk at issuance and the level of subordination) of a similar instrument with the same conditions (maturity, cash flows), but not convertible into or redeemable for shares. The portion recognized in equity is calculated as the difference between the amount of the issue and the debt component. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the expected disbursements over the term of the loan in order to obtain the carrying amount of the portion of the loan recorded in borrowings. 4.18. Taxes 4.18.1. Current taxes The Group calculates its income tax in accordance with the tax laws in force in the countries where its income is taxable. The Group recognizes the corporate value added tax (cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises – CVAE), based on the value added resulting from the company financial statements, on the “Income tax expense” line in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 4.18.2. Deferred tax In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred taxes are recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their taxable amounts. Under the liability method, they are calculated based on the expected tax rate for the year in which the asset is liquidated or the liability settled. The effects of changes in tax rates from one year to another are recognized in profit or loss for the year in which the change occurs. Deferred tax relating to items recognized directly in equity is also recognized directly in equity. A deferred tax liability is recognized in respect of temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries unless the Group is able to control the date on which the temporary difference is reversed, or if the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences, tax-loss carryforwards and tax credits are limited to the estimated amount of tax whose recovery is deemed probable. This probability is assessed at the end of the year, based on earnings forecasts for the various fiscal entities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 4.19. Balance sheet presentation – Current/Non-current ----- ##### For the majority of the Group’s activities, it has been decided that the criterion for this classification is the date of liquidation of the asset or settlement of the liability: current if less than 12 months and non-current if more than 12 months. 4.20. Revenue recognition The Group’s revenue is derived mainly from the following products and services: ▪ Network sales revenues: entry fees of new franchisees; franchise and communication fees charged to franchisees. Revenue is recognized as and when control of the service is transferred over the duration of the franchise agreement; revenue in the form of fees is recognized on the date on which the underlying sale occurs. ▪ Network sales revenues include sales of lenses, contact lenses and frames to franchisees through the Group’s central purchasing structure. These sales of products trademarked ALAIN AFFLELOU are recognized on the date of transfer of control to exclusive distributors and franchisees. Referral, del credere and distribution commissions to referenced suppliers and finder’s fees are accounted for as and when sales are made. ▪ Revenues from directly owned stores: retail sales of directly owned stores operating under the “ALAIN AFFLELOU” and “OPTICAL DISCOUNT” banners, and sales resulting from the “ALAIN AFFLELOU ACOUSTICIEN” hearing aid activity. Revenue is recognized on the date of transfer of control. The Group’s revenue is reported net of guarantees and discounts granted. 4.21. Cost of purchases The cost of the Group’s purchases includes the supply cost of goods sold, namely: ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass frames; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of eyeglass lenses; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of contact lenses; ▪ The purchasing and supply cost of accessories and other goods; ▪ Change in inventories of all of the above purchases; ▪ Direct communication costs. 4.22. Operating income from ordinary activities and other non-recurring operating items ##### Operating income from ordinary activities includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions. To facilitate the reading of the income statement and the Group’s performance, unusual and significant items for the consolidated group are recorded under “Other non-current operating items”. Other operating income and expenses, excluded from operating income from ordinary activities, notably include: ▪ restructuring costs and costs relating to employee retraining measures; ▪ impairment losses on fixed assets, which are recognized primarily following impairment testing of cash-generating units (CGU) and goodwill; ▪ capital gains or losses resulting from changes in the scope of consolidation or from the acquisition or disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; ▪ major disputes. These items, excluded from operating income due to their nature, amount or frequency, cannot be considered as part of operating income from the Group’s ordinary activities, and correspond to major events that are both limited in scope and very unusual. ----- ##### 4.23. Operating profit Operating profit includes all income and expenses resulting directly from the Group’s activities, whether such income is recurring or stems from one-off decisions or transactions, as well as unusual and significant items for the consolidated group, which are recorded under “Other non-recurring operating items”. ##### 5. Segment reporting ##### 5.1. Organisation of the Group by geographical operating segments The Group breaks its segment reporting down by geography into three areas, namely “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries”. The “France” and “Spain” segments both include a franchisor activity with a central purchasing unit, a central listing and payment unit, and directly owned stores. The “France” segment also includes an audio business operated under a master franchise agreement. The Group has replicated the established organisation of its French operations in Spain, and aims ultimately to repeat this process in the “Other countries” segment. The “Other countries” segment notably includes Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal. This segment includes a central purchasing unit in Belgium, and has only a few directly owned stores, in Portugal. The segment reporting presented here was prepared on the basis of the internal reporting data reviewed by the Chairman, the Group’s “chief operating decision maker” within the meaning of IFRS 8, who analyses the performance of the various segments and allocates resources between them. Assessment of the Group’s results is performed in reference to key financial indicators related to business performance. Alongside the main headings of the consolidated income statement, the key financial indicators used to measure segment performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBIT. These two indicators are Alternative Performance Indicators defined in the last section of this note, and are reconciled with operating income from ordinary activities. Within the Group’s segment reporting by geographical area, two companies are naturally classified in “Other countries”: ▪ The trading subsidiary specializing in exclusive eyeglass frames, based in Switzerland (AAB); ▪ The Luxembourg franchisor company (AAI), which holds international supplier contracts for the entire Group. ##### The trading activity (AAB) and international supplier contract activity (AAI) impact the entire Group. The geographical location in which they are legally based does not necessarily imply an exclusive activity in the “Other countries” segment. To facilitate the readability of the results, the Group has decided to allocate the results of these trading and supplier contract activities across all three segments, using the following allocation key: ▪ The result of the AAB trading subsidiary in Switzerland is reallocated on the basis of the originating country of franchisees in proportion to the number of exclusive eyeglass frames delivered to them during the year; ▪ Commissions earned on the Group’s international supplier contract activity and recognized as revenue by the AAI international franchisor subsidiary are reallocated by country of origin in proportion to the purchasing volumes of the relevant suppliers. The chief operating decision maker does not review a geographical breakdown of information regarding the Group’s assets and liabilities. ----- ##### Information on the Group’s various activities and services is provided in Note 1.2, Note 4.20 on revenue recognition and Note 6.1.1 on revenue by activity. 31/07/2021 31/07/2020 (in thousands of euros) (12 months) (12 months) France 276,844 232,921 Spain 72,899 64,343 Other countries 15,512 11,971 Revenue 365,255 309,235 France 81,006 56,817 Spain 16,295 12,799 Other countries 3,375 1,001 Adjusted EBITDA 100,676 70,616 France (15,922) (12,451) Spain (5,714) (4,979) Other countries (132) (485) Depreciation, amortization and impairment (21,767) (17,916) France 64,517 44,033 Spain 10,441 7,852 Other countries 3,244 515 Adjusted EBIT 78,202 52,401 France 829,444 816,620 Spain 126,844 126,034 Other countries 19,052 18,607 Fixed assets (1) 975,340 961,260 (1) including GW, Trademarks, Intangible and tangible assets and Right of use ##### 5.2. Reconciliation of Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA with operating income from ordinary activities Adjusted EBIT is defined as operating income from ordinary activities as presented in the Group’s consolidated financial statements before the impact of shareholders’ management fees and management bonuses.  Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income from ordinary activities as presented in the Group’s consolidated financial statements, less depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, changes in provisions for trade receivables and inventories, and shareholders’ management fees and management bonuses.

Subsequent events ##### 8.1. Acquisition of eight stores in the Bordeaux region from franchisee Éric Afflelou On 1 October 2021, the Group acquired two companies, ERIC AFFLELOU SAS and A. BORDEAUX SARL, operating eight stores in the Greater Bordeaux area. These eight stores operated under the ALAIN AFFLELOU banner generated more than €10 million in sales in the year ended 30 September 2019 (which was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic). The eight stores constitute one of the oldest portfolios within the group. The transaction was carried out on the basis of a valuation of €8 million for the purchased goodwill, i.e. approximately 80% of their sales. A cash payment of €2 million was made on the signing of the deed of sale of the companies on 6 October 2021. The remainder of the purchase price of the securities, resulting from a revaluation of the net assets of the companies acquired based on the price of the aforementioned purchased goodwill, is accompanied by a five-year vendor credit. Éric Afflelou will retain, within the framework of a general management mandate and for his team of a service provision mandate, the day-to-day management of the portfolio, which will be housed in the Group’s directly owned stores division, represented mainly by L’Opticien Afflelou (LOA) in France. 8.2. Settlement of the dispute concerning the tax deductibility of interest on convertible bonds issued by the Company Signature of a comprehensive settlement with the tax authorities on 13 September 2021 concerning the dispute over the deductibility of interest expense on convertible bonds (see Note 6.6.3. “Notifications, lawsuits and disputes”). -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,624

Losses before the entry into the tax group of F2L, ACADEMIE VISION, GROUPE OPTICAL MÉDITERRANÉE, CATHARE OPTIQUE and OTTICA can be carried forward for an unlimited time on an individual basis. For French companies, tax losses can be offset in respect of a given fiscal year in a maximum amount of €1 million and 50% of the profit in excess of that threshold. Losses can only be carried back to the year prior to that in respect of which the tax loss is recognized, within a limit of €1 million. Losses generated in Portugal since 2014 must be used within 12 years. In addition, effective 1 January 2012, the amount of losses that may be offset in a given fiscal year is capped at 75% of taxable income for that year. The tax losses of Spanish companies can be carried forward for a period of no more than 18 years. 6.1.9. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the weighted average number of outstanding shares less the weighted average number of shares held by consolidated companies. Diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of shares defined above, plus the weighted average number of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive shares are: shares granted in connection with convertible bonds issued at the time of the Group’s refinancing on 17 July 2012, which include bonds convertible into shares (OCA), i.e. potentially 54,568,001 shares; and shares granted in connection with class A mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 6,596,000 shares, and class B mezzanine equity warrants, i.e. potentially 9,520,000 shares. The instruments issued by the Group did not have any dilutive effect in fiscal 2020 or 2021. The maximum number of potential dilutive shares in a subsequent year is 70,684,001. 6.2.

Impairment testing of non-current intangible assets 6.2.6.1._ Nature of impairment testing ##### The Group first tests the assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores, then trademarks and ultimately goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs. Impairment testing of assets and goodwill related to directly owned stores is performed on a store- by-store basis, based on the estimated market value. When in the course of negotiations the Group has indicative offers, it uses them to measure the recoverable amount. In other cases, the recoverable amount is the probable selling price, calculated on the basis of a percentage of the annual revenue before VAT of each store adjusted for the effects of the COVID pandemic, in line with potential market conditions. The original goodwill has been allocated to the “France”, “Spain” and “Other countries” operating segments in proportion to their contribution to Adjusted EBITDA. Insofar as the Alain Afflelou trademark does not on its own account generate cash flows substantially independent from those generated by other corporate assets, it was allocated to the three country CGUs as described above for goodwill. The Optical Discount and Malentille.com trademarks and goodwill have been allocated to the “France” operating segment. 6.2.6.2. Impairment testing methodology within groups of CGUs – Estimates for the calculation of value in use Future cash flow projections are made on the basis of budgets and medium-term business plans. These plans are built on a five-year timeframe. The key assumptions other than the five-year business plan established by the Group are described below. 6.2.6.3. Impairment testing results Impairment testing of goodwill and trademarks in 2021 revealed values in use in excess of the net asset value of the France, Spain and Other countries CGUs. A 5.0% variation in Adjusted EBITDA in 2021, projected over subsequent years, including the terminal year, would have an impact of approximately €52 million on the recoverable amount of the France CGU, €9 million of the Spain CGU and €3 million of the Other countries CGU, with no impact on the valuation of goodwill or trademarks as of 31 July 2021.

The proceeds of these issues, together with the Group’s available cash, enabled - in addition to the repayment of the pre-existing bond debt - the redemption of €135 million of convertible bonds held by the Group’s shareholders.

The Group considers itself to have been in compliance with all the terms of these bonds as of 31 July 2021. 6.2.16.3.2. Revolving credit facility (RCF) of €30 million The new bond was accompanied by the establishment of a €30 million revolving credit facility (RCF). This is a precautionary facility allowing the Group to cover its current requirements, with a term of 54 months from May 2021. The applicable interest rate is a variable rate combining EURIBOR and a margin, the margin being calculated on the basis of a leverage ratio. A non-use commission is applicable in proportion to the margin by draws. The securities of AFFLELOU and 3ABOD have been pledged as collateral, as have the securities of potential borrowing subsidiaries (3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, 3ABOE, AAE and AAO) and the main bank accounts. The early repayment of the RCF would not generate penalties. Reporting obligations are the same as those of bond lenders. The Group must also certify, period-by-period, that Adjusted EBITDA (including the impact of IFRS 16) of the prior 12 months is above €58 million. The most recent such report was made for the quarter ended 30 April 2021. This credit facility is undrawn to date and was therefore fully available as of 31 July 2021.

As of 31 July 2021, the OCA were valued at €181,177,490, after the capitalization of interest. Interests on the OCA are capitalized (the first capitalization took place on 31 July 2013), and payment will be made either on the date of redemption or the date of conversion. The maturity of the convertible bonds has been extended from July 2027 to November 2027. Conversion is possible at any time, on the basis of one share for one bond. Early redemption is possible at the issuer’s initiative, subject to the conditions of the subordination agreement, or, at the holder’s initiative, subject to compliance with the terms of the subordination agreement, in case of change of control or IPO. Equity component of convertible bonds The convertible bonds were recorded as debt and as equity. As of the date of issue, in accordance with IAS 32, the debt component was measured by discounting the value of the contractual cash flows of the convertible debt at an estimated market rate of 17% (see Note 4.17.2). The difference between the value of the compound instrument and the debt component has been recorded in equity in “Other reserves” in the initial amount of €66,274 thousand. As of 31 July 2021, the instrument was valued at €27,806 thousand in equity. Modification resulting from the extension of the term of the convertible bonds In accordance with IFRS 9.B5.4.6, the Group has revised its cash outflow estimates following the extension of the term of the convertible bonds and has adjusted the amortized cost of the financial liability to reflect the actual contractual cash flows and the revised estimated contractual cash flows.

Notes on risk exposure As of 31 July 2021, exposure to various market risks can be analyzed as follows: 6.3.1. The Group’s position in relation to interest rate risk The Group’s policy is to ensure that its exposure to interest rate risk is on fixed-rate borrowings or, for floating rate borrowings, to contract derivative instruments to hedge the volatility of cash flows attributable to interest rate risk. 6.3.2. The Group’s position in relation to currency risk Other than from its purchasing activity with its supplier OKIA, the Group has little exposure to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, which relate primarily to the euro/dollar exchange rate, reflecting the Group’s purchases, which are predominantly denominated is US dollars. To that end, the Group has established agreements on purchasing conditions with OKIA, its main supplier, on the basis of a fixed dollar/euro exchange rate. A derivative embedded in the supply contract allows the impact of changes in the dollar/euro exchange rate compared with the rate set in the contract to be shared equally between the two parties. Finally, it has ensured that the terms of purchasing agreements can be renegotiated in the event of an appreciation of the dollar against the euro. 6.3.3. The Group’s position in relation to credit risk The large number of customers means that there is no concentration of credit risk on the receivables held by the Group. Generally speaking, the Group considers that it is not exposed to specific credit risk on its financial assets, except in France, where secured transactions in payments to suppliers result in del credere commissions. |Total borrowings|2,930|632,427|1,223|Col5|Col6|403,990|227,214|635,357| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---| |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2021 31/07/2020| |---|---| |Opening lease liabilities|83,677 89,879| |Repayment of borrowings Interest expense for the period New loans/finance leases Downward revaluation Other movements|(19,540) (19,001) 4,462 3,892 25,520 8,901 (5,327) 1,456 6| |Closing lease liabilities|90,248 83,677| |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2021|1 to 2 2 to 5 < 1 year > 5 years years years 15,832 14,221 34,252 25,943| |---|---|---| |Short-term borrowings Long-term borrowings|15,832 74,416|| ----- ##### 6.3.4. The Group’s position in relation to liquidity risk Management of liquidity risk by the Group and each of its subsidiaries is monitored closely and periodically assessed, based on Group financial reporting procedures. The Group has a €30 million revolving credit facility, undrawn as of 31 July 2021, to cover any short-term liquidity risk, in addition to an unconfirmed bank overdraft and discounted trade receivables. 6.4.

Sundry guarantees to third parties correspond mainly to rental obligations that the Group has kept with some lessors on stores sold, in exchange for similar commitments received in the Group’s favour, from franchisee buyers. These guarantees also include commitments to purchase stores from three franchisees (compared with two franchisees as of 31 July 2020). Bonds and bank guarantees given cover liabilities to banks financing franchisees, either as part of acquisitions or openings of outlets or assistance with funding refurbishments or working capital. Secured loans are part of the overall budgets. The Group is involved in these transactions in its capacity as guarantor to these banks of the financing they provide to franchisees in the proportion of 100% of each application for financing, with in certain cases a maximum portion of the overall package. Commitments received related to the central payment structure consist mainly of pledges and guarantees made by the franchisees on schedules or agreements covering the repayment of the debts of the central payment structure. In addition, the Group benefits from commitments received as part of the relationship with franchisees. Under franchise agreements, franchisees are encouraged to make personal guarantees in favour of the Group for the obligations and liabilities they incur to the Group’s central payment structure. These guarantees are generally prorated at 30% of annual net revenue in France and Spain. However, only guarantees and sureties related to franchisees’ specific debts (agreements, staggered payments, vendor loans) are shown in the table of commitments received. Moreover, in conjunction with the refinancing of its borrowings, the Group has given the following commitments: ▪ debt guaranteed by 3ABOD, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur, LOA, LSFA, AAI and 3ABOE; |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2021 31/07/2020| |---|---| |Cash and cash equivalents Bank overdrafts|38,657 76,893 (100) (12)| |Total|38,557 76,881| |(in thousands of euros)|31/07/2020|31/07/2021|< 1 1 to 5 > 5 year years years| |---|---|---|---| |Lease commitments – operating leases Sundry guarantees to third parties Securities and bank guarantees – Spain Securities and bank guarantees – France|93 16,123 11,235 7,386|42 20,396 9,471 5,509|39 3 15,708 4,632 56 2,266 6,629 576 3,534 1,975 0| |Commitments given|34,837|35,418|21,547 13,240 632| |Guarantees related to stores sold by the Group Liabilities related to the central payment structure Securities and bank guarantees – Other countries|7,808 4,454 498|7,633 5,544 1,674|1,232 3,588 2,814 1,503 2,959 1,082 0 1,674 0| |Commitments received|12,760|14,851|2,734 8,221 3,896| ----- ##### ▪ pledge of the shares of 3ABOD, AAFR, LOA, LSFA, 3ABOE and AAI, as well as the main bank accounts of the subsidiaries; ▪ pledge of partners’ current accounts with the aforementioned subsidiaries. 6.6.2. Dependence of the Group on patents, licences and supply contracts The Group is not significantly dependent on patents, licenses or supply contracts. 6.6.3. Notifications, lawsuits and disputes Companies belonging to the Group may become involved in lawsuits or litigation in the normal course of their business, including disputes with tax, social security or customs authorities. Notification of VAT deductibility On 8 December 2017, the Group received a notification from the tax authorities following an audit of VAT deducted by Optical Finance in the years 2014 to 2016. Adjustments notified by the tax authorities amounted to €1.5 million. Following receipt of the tax authorities’ assessment on 16 August 2018, the group decided to pay the sum corresponding to the principal adjustment of €966 thousand. Nevertheless, the Group referred the matter to the Paris administrative tribunal, considering the authorities’ position to be unfounded. The Group also called the vendor warranties issued by the vendor shareholders on its acquisition of Optical Finance, which are capped at €1 million. Investigation by the French Competition Authority On 27 May 2015, the French Competition Authority notified Alain Afflelou Franchiseur of grievances, accusing it of “having colluded with providers of eye- and sunglass frames, from 2003 at the latest and until 2009, to fix retail prices and to impede the fixing of prices through free competition in violation of the provisions of Article L.420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 paragraph 1 of the TFEU”. The French Competition Authority issued a decision on the vertical agreement grievances on 24 February 2017. It decided to refer the issue back for further investigations. On 19 April 2019, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received notification of additional grievances in which no grievance was filed against it. No response was therefore given to this notification. On 2 March 2020, Alain Afflelou Franchiseur received the additional report from the French Competition Authority. Even though Alain Afflelou Franchiseur is still not concerned by the additional grievances, it issued a response to the Competition Authority on certain procedural arguments of interest to it. Under the terms of its decision 21-D-20 of 22 July 2021 relating to practices implemented in the eyewear and eyeglass frames sector, the French Competition Authority definitively closed this dispute, without any finding against the AFFLELOU Group. Deductibility of interest expense on convertible bonds A tax adjustment notice was served in December 2018 in respect of income tax for the years ended 31 July 2013, 2014 and 2015. It concerned the deductibility of the 14% interest expense on the convertible bonds issued in July 2012 as part of the Group’s acquisition by LBO, in an amount of approximately €203 million. The French tax authorities reject the deductibility of the interest on these convertible bonds. The Group, on the basis of the analysis carried out by our legal and tax advisors, contested the proposed adjustment in a response sent to the French tax authorities in February 2019. However, the Group received an audit notice on 7 April 2021 concerning fiscal years 2016 to 2020. Since then, discussions have taken place with the tax authorities, resulting in the acceptance of an agreement with them. The comprehensive settlement signed with the tax authorities, in addition to definitively closing the dispute and eliminating the potential risk of legal action for abuse of rights, generated a €31 million reduction in deferred tax assets (out of total deferred tax assets in respect of tax loss carryforwards of €65.8 million as of 31 July 2020) without any tax payment or penalty. ----- ##### Other tax disputes involving corporate income tax Following a tax audit launched in 2015 covering the period from 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2012, the French tax authorities issued an initial tax reassessment notice primarily reassessing the price at which Alain Afflelou Franchiseur sold certain loss-making subsidiaries in 2010, claiming that the sale price would have had to be higher for it to be considered at arm’s length. The company and its legal and tax advisors believe that there are strong arguments to challenge the position of the French tax authorities. If, however, the arguments of the tax authorities were to prevail, the potential amount of the adjustment would be €21 million on the tax base. Verification of supplier payment terms On 21 September 2020, DIRECCTE initiated an inspection in connection with the commitment made by Alain Afflelou Franchiseur to comply with the legal payment terms formulated at the time of its application for a government-guaranteed loan. On 2 March 2021, the company submitted its comments on the payment terms monitored by DIRECCTE for the period from 1 June 2020 to 31 August 2020 and produced all documents in support of these observations. After a hearing on 2 March 2021, DIRECCTE drew up a report of the statement and took copies of the documents. At this stage, DIRECCTE has not followed up on this hearing. 6.7. Related parties 6.7.1.
