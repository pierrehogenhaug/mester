Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations, intentions or forecasts of future events.

Words or phrases such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “may,” “ongoing,” “plan,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “seek,” “target” or similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled “Risk factors” in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, even if our actual results are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. For example, factors that could cause our actual results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - our ability to maintain, expand or develop our relationships with our customers; - uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions, including in Italy; - risks related to data security breaches; - competition from large or established competitors and local specialized competitors; - our ability to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments and the expectations of our customers; - delayed payments or non-payments by our customers; - our ability to promote and market our products as well as to maintain positive brand awareness and reputation; - damages, interruptions and lack of redundancy of our or our partners’ IT systems; - undetected defects or delays in the introduction of new software products and enhancements; - lower growth in the market for cloud-based applications than we expect or difficulty transitioning customers to cloud technology; - our dependence on certain third-party cloud infrastructure providers; - unfavorable economic conditions increasing our costs of indebtedness; - interpretation of the Italian Golden Power Legislation and its applicability to the Issuer and the Group; - more stringent regulations in the area of data privacy; - our ability to maintain our relationships with VARs and agencies and to continue the internalization of our VARs; - new regulations or the absence of regulatory changes related to the sale of certain of our products; - risks related to our outsourcing initiatives; - cyclicality of a portion of our revenues; ----- - changes to the terms on which we sell third party software; - unforeseen integration obstacles or costs of acquired businesses; - higher employment costs; - the potential impact of non-controlling shareholders on the material business decisions of our majority-owned subsidiaries and payments required under related put and call options; - our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees; - third party infringement on our intellectual property rights; - claims from third parties that we are infringing on their intellectual property; - the seasonal nature of our business; - long sales cycles relating to our SME and professional customers; - regulatory risk exposure associated with our subsidiaries operating in the financial industry; - our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls; - labor disputes and work stoppages; - risks related to changes to our sales organization and other corporate functions; - liabilities that may not be covered by insurance; - potential goodwill impairments; - risks relate to our expansion outside of Italy; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates; - tax and social security audits; - the potential impact of litigation; - liabilities associated with our directors, employees or other agents; - failure to prevent regulatory penalties, fraud or any violation of applicable anti-corruption legislation; - competition and antitrust laws; - changes to the corporate tax system; - failure to meet stakeholders’ ESG expectations and ESG regulatory requirements; - other risks associated with our financial information, our financial profile, our capital structure, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral; and - other factors discussed under “Risk factors.” Accordingly, prospective investors should not rely on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum or as otherwise indicated. We do not have any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of such forward-looking statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. We urge you to read carefully the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Risk Factors,” “Management’s _Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry and Market Data” and_ “Business” for a more detailed discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the markets ----- in which we operate.

Accordingly, prospective investors should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which the statements were made. In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our security holders and other communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. We undertake no obligation, and do not intend, to update or revise any forward-looking statement or risk factors, whether as a result of new information, future events or developments or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. The risks described in the “Risk factors” section of this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

In particular, we have included and discussed the historical consolidated financial information comprising: (1) the audited consolidated financial statements of TeamSystem Holdco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 and the auditor’s report thereto, prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “2023 Financial Statements”); (2) the audited consolidated financial statements of TeamSystem Holdco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, including comparative information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 (see “—Comparability of the Financial Statements”) and the auditor’s report thereto, prepared in accordance with IFRS (the “2022 Financial Statements” and, together with the 2023 Financial Statements, the “Audited Financial Statements”); and (3) the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of TeamSystem Holdco as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including unaudited comparative information for the three months ended March 31, 2023, prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Audited Financial Statements, the “Consolidated Financial Statements”). Our Audited Financial Statements have been audited by Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. The Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euro and have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and should be read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto. As further described below under “—Comparability of the Financial Statements,” the comparative financial information of TeamSystem Holdco for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the 2022 Financial Statements and presented in this Offering Memorandum comprises the results of the 2021 TeamSystem Group (as defined below) only since its acquisition by Brunello Bidco on February 18, 2021. Such information is therefore not fully comparable with the financial information of TeamSystem Holdco presented in this Offering Memorandum for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. In addition, as the historical financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum and the Consolidated Financial Statements relate to TeamSystem Holdco, they diverge from certain consolidated historical financial information of the Issuer also included in this Offering Memorandum with respect to the Issuer, primarily due to the Existing PIK Notes issued by Holdco 3, a subsidiary of TeamSystem Holdco and the direct shareholder of the Issuer. For more information on these differences, see “—The Issuer.” Certain line items in the revenue breakdown by business unit presented in this Offering Memorandum have been reclassified, as further described in “—Business units and revenue breakdowns.” In addition, in our 2022 Financial Statements and 2023 Financial Statements, the comparative financial information as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022, respectively, was restated to reflect the completion of the purchase price allocation to goodwill in relation to certain acquisitions that occurred in 2021 and 2022, respectively. As a result, our consolidated statement of financial position for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 presented in this Offering Memorandum have been derived from the corresponding comparative column in the 2022 Financial Statements and in the 2023 Financial Statements respectively (and not from the Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 and the 2022). For more information, see “—Impact of bolt-on _acquisitions made by the TeamSystem Group.”_ The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires the board of directors to exercise its judgment in the process of applying accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to our financial statements, are disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

(i.e. the entity which originally issued the Existing Senior Secured Notes), Barolo Luxco 1 S.p.A., TeamSystem Holding S.p.A. and the Issuer (the “Merger”), which was completed on October 26, 2021 (“Merger Date”). As a result of the Merger, and starting from the Merger Date, the Issuer assumed, inter alia, all the obligations of Brunello Bidco S.p.A. with respect to the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. While the historical financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum and the Consolidated Financial Statements appended hereto are of TeamSystem Holdco, we also present in this Offering Memorandum certain consolidated historical financial information of the Issuer and its subsidiaries. Such information has been calculated by netting the relevant amount pertaining to TeamSystem Holdco and the intermediate holding companies sitting between TeamSystem Holdco and the Issuer in the corporate structure of the TeamSystem Group from the consolidated financial information of TeamSystem Holdco. In addition, we present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information of the Issuer (which has been calculated pursuant to the above) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 on an adjusted basis, to give pro forma_ effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2024 for the as adjusted statement of financial position information and on April 1, 2023 for the as adjusted statement of profit or loss information.

As a result, TeamSystem Holdco’s consolidated statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows information for the year ended December 31, 2021 comprise the results of the 2021 TeamSystem Group only since its acquisition by Brunello Bidco on February 18, 2021.

As a result of the impact of the 2021 Acquisition on TeamSystem HoldCo’s financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021, the statement of profit or loss and statement of cash flows for such year included in the comparative column in the 2022 Financial Statements and presented in this Offering Memorandum are not fully comparable with the statement of profit or loss or the statement of cash flows for any subsequent year. The consolidated financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 included in the comparative column in the 2022 Financial Statements presented elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum does not give pro forma effect to the 2021 Acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2021, nor was it restated to give effect to such impact. As a result, such information includes only the consolidated results of operations of the 2021 TeamSystem Group from the date of completion of the 2021 Acquisition (February 18, 2021) to December 31, 2021.

The 2021 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been calculated on the basis of management estimates and assumptions and has not been subject to any audit or review procedures carried out by any independent auditor. While we believe that the 2021 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information can be useful to potential investors seeking to evaluate our performance over time, such financial data is not compliant with IFRS or any other accounting standards. Such 2021 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information have been prepared by, and is the responsibility of, management. The 2021 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information are based on a number of assumptions and estimates (including the elimination of certain non-recurring costs relating to the 2021 Acquisition, the inclusion of the costs and interest relating to the _pro forma capital structure of the 2021 ----- TeamSystem Group as it were in place since January 1, 2021, the inclusion of the results of the businesses that the 2021 TeamSystem Group acquired through 2021 as if such acquisitions had been consummated on January 1, 2021 as well as other assumptions and estimates) that are subject to inherent uncertainties and you are strongly cautioned against placing undue reliance thereon. The preparation of this financial data requires management to exercise judgment and make assumptions and for these reasons, the 2021 Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information are only a simulation of the 2021 TeamSystem Group’s results had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021 and they are not an indication of what our results would have been had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on such date.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.13,Measures and Ratios”). We believe that the presentation of these Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios is helpful to,4.13.1,Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA,"We do not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results. In this Offering Memorandum, however, we have presented certain _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA measures for the purposes of illustrating, among other things, the impact of certain initiatives that we have recently taken in order to improve our profitability. We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful indication of what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 would have been under certain circumstances and assumptions as described herein. See “Summary historical financial information and other data—Other _financial and pro forma data” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We have presented certain adjusted and pro forma financial information in this Offering Memorandum that is based upon management estimates including in respect of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for certain cost saving initiatives, annualized recurring revenues, Adjusted EBITDA generated from bolt-on acquisitions. The relevance of these measures depends upon the accuracy of a series of estimates and assumptions involving factors that are beyond our control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.”_ The assumptions used in estimating these _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA components are forward-looking in nature, inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of business, economic and competitive risks and uncertainties. We cannot assure you that the information on which we have based our assumptions will not change or that we will be able to realize any of the as-yet unrealized cost savings or revenue benefits we believe are possible based on these management estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA does not represent the results we would have achieved (x) had the relevant cost saving initiatives been implemented as of April 1, 2023 and (y) had all of the relevant subscription agreements relating to our key cloud products (existing as of March 31, 2024) been in place as of April 1, 2023 and had all subscription fees thereunder been regularly paid by our customers for the entire relevant period. In addition, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes a pro forma adjustment for the contribution to our Adjusted EBITDA of certain bolt-on acquisitions for the periods and as further specified under “Summary—Summary historical financial information and other data— _Other financial and pro forma data.” Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to, among other_ things, integrate such businesses into the Group or any potential revenue or cost synergies or other impacts related to or expected to derive from such acquisitions, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the contribution of such businesses to our Adjusted EBITDA would have been for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 if we had acquired and consolidated such businesses on April 1, 2023. Certain of such acquisitions are presently only subject to executed acquisition agreements, the consummation of which is subject to certain closing conditions, and there can be no assurance or guarantee that the consummation of these acquisitions will occur. _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was not prepared with a view toward complying with the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants with respect to prospective financial information; however, in the view of our management, this information was prepared on a reasonable basis, reflects the best currently available estimates and judgments, and presents, to the best of our managements’ knowledge and belief, our expected course of action and expected future financial performance. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA measures contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability, and assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.13,Measures and Ratios”). We believe that the presentation of these Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios is helpful to,4.13.2,,"investors because these and other similar measures and ratios are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. However, investors should not place any undue reliance on these Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios as financial indicators and should not consider these measures as: (a) alternatives to operating income or net income as determined in accordance with IFRS, or as measures of operating performance; (b) alternatives to cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities (as determined in accordance with IFRS), or as measures of our ability to meet cash needs; or (c) alternatives to any other measures of performance under IFRS. These measures are not indicative of historical operating results, nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These measures are used by management to monitor our underlying performance and our business and operations. Since companies do not calculate these measures in an identical manner, our presentation may not be consistent with similar measures used by other companies. In addition, the presentation of these Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios is not intended to, and does not comply with, the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and will not be subject to review by the SEC; compliance with its requirements would require us to make changes to the presentation of this information. Therefore, investors should not place undue reliance on the Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios. An explanation of the relevance of each of the Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios, a reconciliation of the Non-IFRS Measures and Ratios to the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and a discussion of their limitations is set out in this Offering Memorandum under “Summary historical financial _information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data.” We do not regard these non-IFRS measures as_ a substitute for, or superior to, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS or those calculated using financial measures that are calculated in accordance with IFRS. In particular, our EBITDA-based measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for the analysis of our results or any performance measures under IFRS as set forth in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Some of the limitations relating to EBITDA-based measures are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statement of profit or loss; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; - although amortization, depreciation and write-downs are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated or amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and certain of these non-IFRS measures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, EBITDA-based measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our results reported under IFRS and using these EBITDA-based measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance. These indicators should not be considered in isolation or construed as a substitute for measures in accordance with IFRS.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of €778.7 million (compared to €423 million for the year ended December 31, 2020) and €334.8 million (compared to €209 million for the year ended December 31, 2020), respectively. The following chart sets forth our total revenue breakdown by business unit for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 83.5% of our total revenue from recurring sources, which are primarily related to annual software assistance and maintenance contracts, annual subscription contracts, annual fees from our multi-year contracts with VARs and fees from temporary annual licenses (licenze _temporanee annuali) that we sell to our customers whenever the Italian government introduces a new regulatory_ obligation (e.g., a new tax digital reporting obligation or tax payment) that requires a dedicated feature to be added to our software products (we refer to such temporary annual licenses as “Regulatory LTAs”). We believe that our technology leadership, significant and ongoing expansion of our cloud-based solutions, the mission-critical nature of our products and the overall willingness of our customers to renew their contracts have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our high annual subscription contracts and renewal rates. Most of our products are deeply integrated into our end-customers’ IT systems and business processes, and their replacement is normally a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process, requiring extensive training for users. In addition, our digital and cloud-based solutions platform, Digital Invoice, designed to operate across all our digital products, is integrated with all our ERP solutions and allows our customers to digitally send, receive, register and store electronic invoices from and to private customers, companies, public entities, banks and external accountants and to send tax filings to the relevant tax authorities electronically. Our three key customer groups are micro and small businesses, mid-market businesses and professionals, which are located both in Italy and abroad. Our end-customer base, including VAR’s end-customers, increased from approximately 88,000 as of December 31, 2009 to approximately 2.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Of this total figure, approximately 87.7% are micro and small businesses, approximately 8.6% are mid-market businesses and approximately 3.7% are professionals. Our large and diverse customer base is highly fragmented and diversified in terms of size and geography. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 276 thousand customers outside of Italy, our ten largest customers generated 5.0% of our total revenue, while our 50 largest customers and 200 largest customers generated 10.4% and 15.3%, respectively. Our customer base is also spread across a variety of industries, including accountancy, labor advisory, manufacturing, industrial, construction, wellness, hospitality, fashion, retail, distribution, food and beverage, legal and other professional services sectors. ----- We have strategically internalized our VARs to establish stronger and more direct relationships with our customer base. This approach allows us to provide personalized and seamless services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Such approach also supports our upselling initiatives, offering tailored solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients and aiding them in the continuing transition to cloud solutions. Through these efforts, we ensure our clients benefit from the latest technological advancements while maintaining our competitive edge in the field. In furtherance of our internalization strategy, we have continued to pursue a series of bolt-on acquisitions to bolster our competitive position, expand our product offerings and continue our international expansion. In recent years, we expanded into Spain by acquiring a controlling interest in the Spanish start-up Billin and consolidated our presence in the country by acquiring Software del Sol. In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio with acquisitions such as Acumbamail and Aplifisa, and entered the Turkish sector by acquiring the Mikro group. Lastly, in 2024, we entered into an acquisition agreement with the French ERP software provider to continue expand our presence outside of Italy. Our acquisitions have contributed positively to our revenue growth, product and business mix diversification. This acquisition strategy is key to our growth plan, driving sustained expansion and reinforcing our leadership in the sector. We implemented a series of nominal price increases across our customer segments. In the micro and small businesses customer segment, prices were raised by a total of 10 percentage points from 2021 to 2023, due to a high inflationary environment. In the mid-market segment, we saw a nominal price increase of 3.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023, while in the professionals customer segment, also from 2020 to 2023, prices increased by 7.0 percentage points over the same period. During these periods, we also observed changes in customer churn. In the micro and small businesses segment, churn decreased by 0.2 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. The mid-market segment experienced a slight 0.5 percentage points churn increase between 2020 and 2023, and in the professionals customer segment, churn decreased by 1.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023. We divide our product offering into the following three product suites and five horizontal solutions:",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strengths,9.3.1,Large and growing segments benefitting from secular digitalization with regulatory tailwinds and significant investments and expertise requirements,"We offer both cloud solutions (SaaS and IaaS) and on-premises solutions, in each case across sizeable and attractive sectors both in Italy and internationally, which offer substantial growth opportunities mainly supported by regulatory tailwinds, operational complexities and considerable initial investments. While Italy remains our core segment, we have entered the Spanish segment in 2020 in which we further consolidated our position in 2023 through the acquisition of Acumbamail and Aplifisa, as well as the Turkish segment, where in 2023 we acquired MikroGrup, a leading local player. As a leading player in the ERP sector in Italy, Spain and Turkey, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage the favorable conditions and expected trends in these countries to drive growth and expand our competitive presence. As December 31, 2023, our total serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) was estimated to be worth approximately €5.8 billion (approximately €11.5 billion of total addressable market (“TAM”)), growing at an expected CAGR of approximately 9% between 2023 and 2027. Our SAM has grown over time, from approximately €1.1 billion in 2016, to approximately €5.8 billion in 2023, due to the growth of our core Italian ERP sector and entry into new segments such as HR, Digital Finance and CRM and automation, as well as new geographies such as Spain and Turkey. Moreover, the SAM is expected to further grow to approximately €8.3 billion in 2027. These SAM figures include also the International ERP and FMS sectors in Spain and Turkey, which are estimated to be worth approximately €1.0 billion (€3.2 billion TAM) in 2023 and are expected to growth at a CAGR of approximately 12% between 2023 and 2027. Our SAM has significantly expanded via both geographic reach and product diversification, making it less susceptible to macroeconomic fluctuations. Historically, our SAM has demonstrated robust resilience through various economic cycles, including the financial crises of 2009 and 2012, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming Italy’s GDP growth. This resilience is further reinforced by our strategic focus and successful repositioning initiatives in high-growth segments, such as micro and digital finance. _Source: Global Consulting Company Report for Italy, Management analysis for Spain and Turkey, International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2024, for GDP. Note: Chart displays organic SAM growth, assuming a like-for-like perimeter year over year._ We believe there is still significant whitespace to benefit from, equivalent to the difference between SAM and TAM, which we expect to target by expanding our product offering and increasing customer reach, thereby targeting client segments currently not covered or not served with specific propositions. ----- The ERP sector in Italy, Spain, and Turkey are expected to experience continued growth, propelled by regulatorydriven tailwinds, ongoing digitalization, increased ERP software adoption across all customer sizes, and the transition to cloud-based solutions. These factors result in us being well placed to further benefit from our competitive positions and capitalize on emerging opportunities. _Italy_ In Italy, the main drivers for growth are stable demand, regulatory tailwinds, digitalization and ERP uptake, cloud transition, cybersecurity concerns and growing adoption of generative AI. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and further expand our presence across our reference segments. The Italian ERP software market is characterized by operational complexities and considerable initial investments, particularly for international competitors, due to cultural and local commercial complexities. These include language barriers, complex payroll rules, local accounting standards (Italian GAAP), and evolving regulatory constraints in key sectors like banking, energy, and healthcare. These complexities favor local and regional players, allowing us to capitalize on our leading position in the field. Our deep knowledge of the domestic landscape and long-standing relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian customers and partners further strengthen our competitive advantage. In 2021, local and regional players held a combined 55% share, compared to an average of 25% in other EU countries, as shown in the chart below. _Source: Global Consulting Company Report._ ERP solutions are fundamental to the day-to-day activities of businesses, especially as the operations of Italian enterprises become increasingly complex. This complexity drives demand for a broader range of innovative management solutions to monitor key activities. Accounting and payroll management software remain core due to stringent Italian regulations requiring digital fiscal and labor filings. Our state-of-the-art cloud-based solutions ensure compliance with these demanding and ever-changing regulatory requirements, providing seamless support even in light of changing regulations. This allows our customers to focus on their core activities without diverting pivotal resources, ensuring stable demand and revenues for our mission-critical services. The ongoing digitalization trend in Italy is primarily driven by stringent regulatory requirements, which impose significant fiscal and administrative burdens on companies and create a strong demand for up-to-date management software that streamlines administrative functions and establishes operational complexities and considerable initial investments for new competitors. We are well-positioned to meet this demand by providing products and updates that help clients ensure regulatory compliance. Subsidies introduced over the past few years, such as the “Industry 4.0” initiative, which offers financial vouchers to promote the digitalization of SMEs and micro and small businesses, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza), which allocates approximately €40 billion for digitalization projects across the public sector, further incentivize digitalization in Italy. Moreover, the increasing role of European ESG regulations, such as the CSRD, is expected to drive demand for ESG software solutions. These regulations require standardized ESG disclosures from both large enterprises and SMBs, creating a need for sophisticated compliance tools. Our expertise and comprehensive product offerings ----- uniquely position us to help businesses navigate these regulatory landscapes, consolidating our competitive position leadership and expanding our customer base. The Italian market is also poised to benefit from government policies, incentives, and subsidies that promote digitalization. Italy demonstrates strong performance in the adoption of cloud services, with approximately 50% of enterprises utilizing this technology, significantly surpassing the EU average of 34%. Unlike other Mediterranean countries, Italy’s penetration rates for cloud services more closely resemble those of Nordic and Benelux economies, which have historically been more advanced in terms of digitalization. The chart below shows the digitalization rate of EU countries as of December 31, 2023[(1)]: _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI); 2023 Indicators, data from 2021._ Note: “Enterprise with Clouds Solutions” represents enterprises which have adopted at least one of the following cloud solutions: finance or accounting software applications; ERP software applications; CRM software applications; security software applications; hosting the enterprise’s database(s); computing platform providing a hosted environment for application development, testing or deployment. Furthermore, approximately 70% of SMEs in Italy have at least a basic level of digital intensity, just above the EU average of 69%, and well above other Mediterranean countries such as France and Spain. Progress in digitalization in Italy is especially pronounced in the use of e-invoices, where Italy outperforms the European average, being one of the first countries to make e-invoices mandatory for all companies, regardless of size. This strong adoption of cloud services and digital tools underscores the readiness of Italian enterprises to embrace digital transformation, further driving demand for our advanced ERP and FMS solutions. _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI) 2023 Indicators, data from 2022. The digital intensity score is based on counting how many of twelve selected technologies are used by enterprises. A basic level requires usage of at least four technologies._ Despite the above, the Italian market is considered to be still at the early stages of its digital transformation journey. While it has achieved a nearly 100% adoption rate for e-invoicing software across companies of all sizes, driven by government regulations, there remain substantial growth opportunities for ERP, CRM and business ----- intelligence software, especially among micro and small-sized businesses where the adoption rate is currently below 30%. The chart below shows the software adoption rate by company size as of December 31, 2023 _Source: ISTAT report imprese 2023._ Lastly, within the global cloud market, the ERP sector is less penetrated than other functional markets. Adoption of cloud-based ERP software has been slower compared to financial applications and performance software, which remain predominantly on-premise. This contrasts with the CRM and HCM sectors, where the transition to cloudbased technology has been quicker. The slower adoption rate of ERP systems is due to their mission-critical nature and the increased need for customization compared to CRM and HCM systems. However, cloud adoption in the Italian ERP sector has been steadily increasing, with penetration expected to reach approximately 48% of the market in 2023 and continue to rise thereafter. We believe this additional trend presents a significant opportunity for us to expand our cloud-based ERP offerings and capture a growing share. The ever-increasing demand for cybersecurity is also a significant growth driver, with cyber attacks rising dramatically across all industries. In 2022, global cyber attacks increased by 21.5% compared to 2021, and Italy saw a staggering 170% increase, making it the fourth most targeted country. Many attacks result from human error, highlighting the need for better technology training and simple software solutions. With low current SMB adoption of cybersecurity software, there is a substantial growth opportunity for products dedicated to cyber risks mitigation. We believe the EU Cybersecurity SMB software TAM, which was worth approximately €12 billion in 2022, is expected to grow by 12% between 2022 and 2024. By offering and integrating robust cybersecurity features into our ERP and FMS solutions, we can enhance our value proposition and consolidated our position within the sector. Furthermore, the availability of new technology, such as advanced machine learning and generative AI, is a crucial growth driver. The AI sector, which includes software, hardware, and services, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18% between 2020 and 2025, with software being the dominant segment. Success in the ERP space will depend on leveraging generative AI for internal efficiency and integrating it into customer solutions. In Italy, AI awareness is increasing, with many professionals recognizing it as a key trend and considering AI products to enhance efficiency and productivity. Our significant investments in Data and AI position us to meet our customers’ evolving needs, offering advanced AI-infused business applications that drive efficiency and productivity, thereby strengthening our competitive edge. _Spain_ We believe that, similar to Italy, growth in the Spanish ERP sector is driven by regulatory changes, increasing digitalization, and the transition to cloud-based solutions. Regulation in Spain plays an active role in sustaining our sector dynamics. Key regulatory trends expected to positively impact the ERP sector in Spain include grants and subsidies, tax level changes, accounting software standard enforcement, and mandatory e-invoicing. Spain is making notable progress in digital technology integration, particularly through initiatives targeting the digitalization of SMEs and the self-employed. These efforts are driving the growth in the ERP sector and increasing the demand for advanced accounting software due to potential fiscal complexities from ongoing tax rate debates and heightened standards following recent data breaches. The shift from voluntary to mandatory einvoicing, set to be compulsory for small and micro-enterprises by 2026 and for larger enterprises by 2024, is a key growth driver. Despite SMEs’ digitalization levels being slightly below the EU average, the Spanish government’s investments in digitalization present significant growth opportunities, not only enhancing SMEs’ ----- capabilities but also impacting ICT specialists, infrastructure, and digital public services. Additionally, measures to boost cloud computing adoption are underway, addressing the current lag behind the European average. Key growth drivers in Spain over the next few years include strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities, with a significant increase in average revenue per customer expected, and a rapid shift to cloud-based services. Cloud penetration is expected to grow substantially across segments, including accountants and small to mid-sized companies. With a deep understanding of the market and a comprehensive suite of ERP and FMS solutions, we believed we are strategically positioned to harness these trends, meeting the evolving needs of the Spanish segment. _Turkey_ Similar to Italy and Spain, growth in the Turkish ERP sector is expected to be driven by regulatory changes and increased digitalization. The Turkish government has worked towards combating the shadow economy by establishing online systems for real-time tracking and auditing. Key initiatives such as e-integration, mandatory online salary payments, and enhanced auditing systems are expected to sustain growth within the ERP sector. Current regulations require companies with a certain level of turnover to comply with e-invoicing regulations, and the inflationary environment in Turkey is likely to increase the number of companies falling within this threshold, therefore expanding the sector.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our strengths,9.3.2,Long-standing leadership position with a strong track record of growth in targeted customer segments,"We believe we have achieved a leading position across our customer segments, product offering and key geographies. In terms of customers, our leading position spans across the Italian micro and small businesses customer segment (“Micro”), in terms of value, which mainly refers to FMS solutions for micro enterprise (including e-invoicing, accounting software and POS systems), mid-market business customer segment (“Enterprise”) in terms of number of seats, which refer to the segment for ERP software for SMEs, and professional customer segment (“Professional”), in terms of number of seats, which comprises accountants and labor and tax advisors. According to the Global Consulting Company Report, as of June 30, 2023, we held more than 30% share in Italy based on market value in the Micro business customer segment. According to IDC, we held a share based on numbers of seats of approximately 30% (compared to an approximately 23% combined share of our three closest competitors) and more than 30% (compared to an approximately 44% combined share of our three closest competitors) in the Italian Enterprise and Professional customer segments, respectively, as of the same date. Our leading position in Italy across our customer segments is the result of many years of developing our proprietary software through significant investment, which has established our reputation for high-quality and reliable products and services in such segments. Since our early entry in the Micro customer segment in 2019, we have built a strong customer base and achieved high client satisfaction, enabling us to grow our share above 30% in terms number of seats between 2019 and the first half of 2023 (Global Consulting Company Report). Our comprehensive offering of innovative software solutions has allowed us to navigate the evolving Italian regulatory environment and establish our leadership position within this fragmented sector. Our extensive product suite not only solidifies our share within our reference segments but also enhances customer loyalty and engagement. As a result, our closest top three competitors in this segment held a collective estimated share in the sector of approximately 26.0% as of June 30, 2023, underscoring our established leadership and the effectiveness of our first-mover advantage (Global Consulting Company Report). In the Enterprise customer segment, we have achieved a clear leadership position, underpinned by our mission to support SMEs in their digital transformation and to improve their efficiency and competitiveness while ensuring compliance with the Italian regulatory framework. Our ability to offer a wide range of services has enabled us to benefit from significant economies of scale. Our integrated and customizable platform of solutions allow us to address the needs of companies across selected verticals, reinforcing our leadership and driving sustained growth. The Professional customer segment is relatively more stable and mature compared to other segments. Our leadership in this segment, which we have maintained since 2019, is underpinned by superior brand recognition, supported by a loyal customer base and delivery of high-quality, reliable and integrated software solutions, which ensures that we remain the preferred choice for professional customers, further consolidating our competitive position. ----- In terms of product offering, we believe to have achieved a promising position in key product segments such as Digital Finance, human resources solutions and certain industry-specific segments. In particular, in the Digital Finance segment we see significant opportunities to further expand our product offerings and increase our competitive presence. Holding less than 1% share in 2023, as a percentage of SAM, there is a high potential for revenue generation in the Digital Finance segment. In the human resources solutions segment, which encompasses HCM and payroll software, we achieved an approximately 7% share in the HCM segment, and an approximately 22% share in the payroll segment, in each case as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2023, we held an approximately 22% share for CAD/CAM solutions and an approximately 7% for Extended CRM and marketing automation. With regards to our geographic sector, we believe we are a leading player in Italy in the ERP sector. In addition, we also operate in attractive segments outside of Italy. Our international expansion began in 2020 with acquisitions in Spain, followed by Turkey in 2022. These strategic moves have significantly increased our presence and influence in these key segments. For our international segment, mainly comprising ERP software solutions for Spain and Turkey, the SAM and TAM amounted to approximately €1.0 billion and approximately €3.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2023. Our strategic operations and experienced leadership enabled us to achieve a share of approximately 4% in Spain, which increased from approximately 2% in 2020, and an approximately 14% share in Turkey, based on revenue generated within these segments divided by the estimated SAM of each segment and expressed as a percentage thereof for the same period. These results underscore our rapid development of influence and competitive edge in these segments.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Customer Retention Rate for micro and small businesses customers is typically slightly lower than Customer Retention Rate for mid-market customers and professionals due to the lower switching costs associated with solutions for micro and small business, mainly as a result of their lower level of complexity, and frequent business lifecycle changes within this segment. We believe that the mission-critical nature of our software products and services, which are deeply embedded in many of our customers’ workflows and IT systems, has historically provided a degree of insulation from economic uncertainties and resulted in our high Customer Retention Rates. Our customers’ operations depend upon our products to facilitate data flow, not only in-house, with respect to internal business management data analysis and storage, but also externally, between our customers and other businesses or between our customers, banks, tax authorities and other public administration organizations. In addition, our high Customer Retention Rate is also supported by our customers’ satisfaction and overall willingness to renew their subscriptions. In particular, mid-market and professional customers tend to carefully consider the migration to alternative software providers in light of, among others,: (i) the mission-critical nature of software and the possibility that customers may be exposed to data migration risk during a transition to an alternative supplier; (ii) the cost and length of time required to transition to an alternative platform given that ERP systems are integral to the various operational segments of an organization; and (iii) the training required to familiarize employees with new software. Moreover, for the professionals customer segment, we believe the adoption of our digital ancillary solutions allows a strong connection and digital interrelation between our professional customers and their endcustomers, making our professional customers more dependent on our products in their day-to-day activities, which, in turn, incentivizes our customers to continue using our products and not to switch to competitors’ solutions. Our NPS for each of our Professional, Enterprise Solutions, Market Specific Solutions and Micro Solutions business units has shown a positive trend over the last four years. This positive trend, as illustrated in the chart below, underscores our ability to consistently deliver value and satisfaction to our customers, further solidifying our position as a leader in Italy. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Moreover, our performance has consistently outpaced the Italian GDP growth, even during challenging economic periods such as the 2009 and 2012 financial crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2012, amidst the global financial crisis, Italy’s GDP declined by 2.8%, while we achieved organic revenue growth of 1.7%, outperforming the Italian GDP by 4.5 percentage points. Similarly, in 2020, when the Italian GDP declined compared to 2019, we achieved 7.3% organic revenue growth, outperforming the Italian GDP by 16.0 percentage points, mainly due to the successful launch of our e-invoicing products and the strong demand for these solutions underpinned by COVID-19 dynamics.

Our proven integration playbook has consistently enabled us to achieve revenue and cost synergies, in the form of cross-selling and upselling for the former and in the form of workforce and real estate rationalization, procurement centralization and other product (for example, the use of Group ----- developer pool, architecture and UX) synergies for the latter. We have been able to achieve for the cohorts acquired between 2011 and 2023 an average revenue CAGR between 15% and 20% and an EBITDA margin expansion between 14 and 16 percentage points, in each case post acquisition. The main goals we have pursued with the latest acquisitions, and intend to continue pursuing, relate to the following main areas: - _product and capabilities enhancement: we have strategically acquired selected startups, software houses, and individual business units to enhance our opportunity to cross-sell and expand our presence in the segments served by these entities; these acquisitions aim at reducing our time-to-market for the launch of new cloud-based and industry specific solutions, providing us with an advantage over our competitors and allowing us to internalize relevant competences and expertise on innovative technologies and products (e.g., solutions for e-mail and SMS marketing as well as technical software for the construction and engineering sectors); - _international expansion: in recent years, we have completed several acquisitions to expand our footprint outside of Italy. This includes selected acquisitions in Spain, where new e-invoicing regulations are expected to be gradually implemented in the coming years, and we anticipate strong digitalization trends and growth potential, particularly in the micro and small business customer segment. Additionally, we have acquired a leading player in Turkey, a geographic area which comprises over 3 million enterprises with high growth and digitalization potential; and - _VARs insourcing: we have acquired and we intend to continue acquiring our VARs. By doing so, we aim to establish strong and direct relationships with our customers, further support our upselling initiatives and continue their transition to cloud solutions. We have a dedicated team focused on the integration of acquired companies and we have developed a disciplined and structured approach to plan and execute all activities required to successfully integrate and extract revenue and cost synergies from acquired companies. In particular, the integration process involves all aspects of the acquired businesses, including finance, cybersecurity, compliance, data protection, reporting, personnel, procurement, facility management, R&D, product integration, marketing and sales and the definition of the value proposition and go-to-market approach for the newly acquired and integrated products. We have made a number of selected and, we believe, highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions over the past few years which we believe have contributed to our success. In particular, over the years, we have developed a structured process to integrate the acquired entities through a well-developed process which spans from three to 24 months, depending on the features and complexities of the deal. Between 2021 and 2022 we have been able to successfully complete a series of bolt-on acquisitions which allowed us to expand and consolidate our presence in terms of product offering and geography. In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio with key acquisitions, including MailUp, a marketing automation platform, and GreeNext, a software developer for waste management. Additionally, we strengthened our presence in Spain by acquiring Acumbamail and Aplifisa, and entered Turkey by acquiring the Mikro group, enhancing our offerings in marketing, accounting, and ERP solutions. Furthermore, we believe that the acquisitions we made have generated revenue synergies. Such acquisitions gave us, for example, the ability to increase our brand recognition internationally, cross-sell and up-sell the products that we acquired to our existing customer base and to enrich our product offering in key strategic areas (e.g., marketing automation with Mail-Up, e-commerce with Storeden, GreenNext for waste management solutions and Beneficy Welfare to enrich our HR platform).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We are dedicated to achieving ambitious environmental targets, including carbon neutrality by 2025 and net zero emissions by 2030. This commitment is reflected in our efforts to transition our datacenter towards green computational capacity by benefitting from advanced software and digitalization techniques to significantly reduce emissions. Our initiatives also include facilitating access to compensation mechanisms and implementing carbon offsetting projects, such as direct investments in local reforestation efforts. Furthermore, we are committed to reducing our office footprint through digitalization, including paper-use reduction via e-invoicing solutions, and transitioning our fleet to full electric and hybrid vehicles. Our environmental focus extends to our customers, suppliers and communities. By benefitting from our software and digitalization capabilities, we aim to facilitate ----- their sustainable transition to more eco-friendly operations.

In the social realm, we are deeply committed to diversity and inclusion as well as employee well-being and development. Our initiatives focus on promoting gender diversity and empowering young graduates. We have implemented a broad program for new ways of working, including working from home and “Light Fridays,” and offer a comprehensive welfare program for employees and their families, which includes online psychological counseling services and periodic training courses. Our diversity and inclusion efforts are supported by a KPI dashboard that tracks metrics such as new hires, re-hires, and promotions.

We also support the development of our employees through comprehensive training and well-being programs, while adopting a sustainable governance and business model to ensure long-term success.

Our management team has demonstrated its ability to grow our business and improve operating performance, as evidenced by the increase in our revenues and Adjusted EBITDA over a long period, including in the face of global economic downturns and economic instability.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.7,TeamSystem Group Organic Revenue Growth (YoY %)[1 ],9.7.4,,"_Source: IMF –World Economic Outlook Database; Management analysis._ (1) The organic growth is based on managerial accounts; statutory organic growth for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was 6.7%, 10.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Our resilience is evidenced by a consistent pattern of organic revenue growth since 2009, even during periods of economic turbulence. We believe such sustained growth is attributable to several key factors: (i) the recurring nature of our contracts; (ii) our customers’ loyalty, as demonstrated by our high NPS and low churn rates; (iii) the mission-critical nature of our software, our broad, rich and fully integrated product suite, which makes customers, particularly SMEs and professional clients, reluctant to switch to alternative suppliers due to the time-consuming migration process, allowing us to maintain sales even during economic downturns; and (iv) our strong brand recognition. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 83.5% of our total revenue from recurring sources (compared to 81.6% in 2021), which we believe provides significant visibility of future earnings. In particular, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 our recurring revenue accounted for 86.5% of our total revenue underscoring our stability and predictability from the first months of each calendar year. The growth in the contribution of revenues with a recurring nature to our total revenue has been driven in part by the increased weight and importance of our cloud solutions in our product portfolio, with the contribution of cloud software solutions revenue to our total revenue increasing from 39.8% in 2021 to 48.5% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. In addition, our profitability and cash flow generation have also shown significant improvement. Our Adjusted EBITDA grew from €170.1 million (€199.7 million on a pro forma basis to give effect the 2021 Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021) in 2021 to €227.3 million in 2022, €313.8 million in 2023, and €334.9 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA margin grew from ----- 41.4% in 2021 (40.8% on a pro forma basis to give effect the 2021 Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021) to 43.0% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe there is a correlation between margins and shares in our reference sectors, therefore, we see strong upside potential as we consolidate our multi-platform offerings. Furthermore, our invoicing strategy enhances our financial stability by invoicing our customers in advance at the beginning of each calendar year during our annual budgeting process. Additionally, most of our contracts are typically renewed unless customers provide a written termination notice prior to expiration. This approach gives us strong visibility over our cash flows and capital requirements, allowing us to carefully plan our capital needs and ensuring consistent and regular revenue streams. We believe that our billing pattern contributes to the overall visibility of our cash flows and ensures substantial liquidity. With over 70% of invoices issued between fourth quarter of each calendar year and the first quarter of the subsequent calendar year, we secure significant cash-in contributions in the first half of the year, effectively covering our cash needs, with about 30% of invoices issued during the second and third quarter of the year, primarily for prepaid cloud products for micro and small businesses. Approximately 35% of our invoices are issued in January and 50% by March, providing us with the liquidity needed for the rest of the year. Year-end invoicing for our In Cloud products, sold on annual subscription models, further enhances cash flow predictability. We believe that this invoicing strategy enables us to effectively predict and monitor our revenue and cash flow levels, ensuring strong liquidity and contributing to our financial stability and operational efficiency. As a result, we maintain a robust Operating Free Cash Flow, which further supports our financial health and strategic initiatives. The following chart shows the evolution of our Operating Free Cash Flow for each calendar month of the year ended December 31, 2023. _Source: Management analysis._ (1) “OCF” means operating free cash flow.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.8,Our strategy,9.8.1,Continue growing our customer base by benefitting from untapped opportunities in the international segments,"We believe that we are best positioned to leverage our broad product platform and capitalize on favorable regulatory tailwinds to continue growing our customer base in the international segments. We intend to continue consolidating our presence in Spain and Turkey while exploring further expansion opportunities, including other European countries. The Spanish ERP sector presents significant growth opportunities. Spain currently lags slightly behind the European average in terms of digitalization, with publicly available data indicating that only approximately onethird of enterprises have adopted cloud solutions. We aim to capitalize on this substantial growth potential by expanding our presence and establishing ourselves as the preferred provider for businesses transitioning to digital business management by, among others, offering comprehensive cloud solutions alongside user-friendly einvoicing systems. Similar to the Italian ERP sector, we believe that favorable regulatory trends in Spain, including mandatory e-invoicing, will facilitate further sector expansion. In particular, the mandatory e-invoicing regulations in Spain, expected to be implemented between 2025 and 2027, present a significant opportunity for growth and expansion. This regulatory change is anticipated to unlock substantial potential, benefitting from an estimated 3.4 million of addressable customers, of which 3.3 million micro businesses and 0.1 million SMEs as of December 31, 2023. The implementation will follow a specific timeline based on a turnover threshold of €8 million, requiring legal entities and sole traders above this threshold to issue and receive e-invoices. We believe this regulatory shift will facilitate the adoption of our comprehensive cloud solutions and user-friendly e-invoicing systems by offering tailored solutions for businesses transitioning to digital business management. ----- In Turkey, the mandatory adoption of e-invoicing, driven by inflation and efforts to address the shadow economy, presents another growth opportunity for us to cater to an estimated 3.8 million of addressable customers, of which 3.5 million micro businesses and 0.3 million SMEs as of December 31, 2023. The expansion of e-invoicing compliance, expected to be implemented between 2023 and 2027, will require e-invoicing for companies with a turnover of 3 million Turkish lira. Approximately 800,000 businesses are expected to fall within the regulation by 2025, with more than 1 million by 2027 due to inflation. This regulatory change is likely to drive micro businesses toward ERP adoption, improving our overall segment penetration. By offering compliant and efficient e-invoicing solutions, we aim to help Turkish businesses navigate the regulatory landscape and enhance their financial management, replicating our successful strategy from Italy.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Our focus on the micro business customer segment has enabled us to secure a leading position in this segment by offering user-friendly e-invoicing solutions. These solutions are available in various packages with additional functionalities and price tiers tailored to the specific needs of clients, such as Fatture in Cloud “Standard,” Fatture in Cloud “Premium,” Fatture in Cloud “Premium Plus,” and Fatture in Cloud “Complete.” Moving forward, we plan to capitalize on upselling opportunities within our existing customer base, particularly among our micro business customers, by transitioning them to premium versions of our software with more advanced features, such as the “Premium,” “Premium Plus,” and “Complete” tiers of our Fatture in Cloud software. To support this upselling strategy, we plan to introduce integrated and comprehensive solutions that capitalize on our strong relationships with accountant customers to facilitate and promote migration from our TeamSystem Digital platform, which generates on average an ARPU ranging from €10 to €20 per year, to higher-ARPU generating solutions, such as Fatture in Cloud and Contabilità in Cloud solutions, which generate on average an ARPU ranging from €140 to €500 per year.

Additionally, we have focused on expanding our horizontal solutions to drive upselling and cross-selling opportunities. This strategic emphasis has enabled us to better meet diverse customer needs and enhance our value proposition. Our internationalization efforts have also been pivotal, expanding our presence beyond Italy and capturing new opportunities, which now account for a growing share of our revenue. To support this expansion and our broader growth objectives, we have revised our organizational structure, aligning it more closely with our strategic priorities and improving operational efficiency. As a result of these strategic focuses, we have achieved remarkable growth and transformation, doubling in scale and enhancing our business diversification and quality, with a significant acceleration in value creation. _Business scale: Since 2020, we have made significant progress across multiple dimensions of our business. Our_ total revenue has increased at a CAGR of 20.2% from €422.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €778.7 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, with average organic growth over the same period ----- reaching 10%.

Additionally, our customer base expanded from 1.6 million as of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by new client acquisitions, particularly among micro and small businesses adopting mandatory e-invoicing, and international growth in Spain and Turkey, which accounted for approximately 300 thousand customers as of December 31, 2023. _Business Mix and Geographic Diversification: We have accelerated our business diversification both_ geographically and in terms of our business mix. In 2020, we only generated revenues in Italy, whereas for the three months ended March 31, 2024, our international expansions grew at a faster pace than our domestic revenue and accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue for such period. Additionally, our revenue mix has also evolved significantly since 2020, with the micro and small customer segment representing approximately 27.0% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 in acceleration representing 31% of our total revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2024, increasing from 18% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have also increased our focus on cross-selling platforms such as HR, Extended CRM and Trust Services, bolstered by strategic acquisitions which have generated 7% of our total revenues for twelve months ended March 31, 2024. _Business Quality: Our business quality has significantly improved, with recurring revenues increasing from 79.7%_ for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 83.5% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and cloud revenues rising from 38% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 49.9% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Since 2021, our customer retention rates and NPS have both improved, with churn levels decreasing across segments despite price increases, and NPS increasing from 36 as of December 31, 2020 to 55 as of December 31, 2023. As a result of the above, the growth in our organic annualized recurring revenues (“ARR”) (representing the annual subscription fees in respect of our subscription agreements relating to certain key products that were in place as of a certain date, net of all subscription fees associated with churning customers who delivered termination notices on or prior to such date) amounted to approximately 10% in 2020, 12% in 2021, 12% in 2022 and 14% in 2023 (with a Net Retention Rate of 105.5%, 104.5%, 107.9% and 106.3% for the same periods).

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.14,Recent developments,9.14.1,Current trading,"_The preliminary results and estimates presented below for the five months ended May 31, 2024 are derived from our internal management accounts, which may not be directly comparable with our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. This information has not been audited or reviewed and no procedures have been completed by our external auditors with respect thereto. These results are subject to the risks related to our business, including those set forth under “Risk factors” and “Forward looking statements” in this Offering Memorandum and, because they are preliminary, are inherently subject to modification. The preliminary results set out below are based on a number of estimates and assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and subject to change. While we believe these preliminary results and estimates to be reasonable, they remain subject to change and our actual results for such periods may vary from the preliminary results presented below, and these variations could be material._ We believe that our recent trading performance for the five months ended May 31, 2024 is in line with our growth trajectory as a result of the same key drivers that positively impacted our results for the first quarter of 2024. In particular, based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available to us, we estimate that for the five months ended May 31, 2024, we generated total revenues of approximately €345.9 million, an increase of approximately €53.0 million (or 18.1%) compared to total revenues of approximately €292.9 million for the five months ended May 31, 2023. We estimate that this increase was primarily driven by the organic growth of our business lines (which grew by 10% period-over-period), including as a result of: (i) the continued adoption of e-invoicing products, especially by micro and small businesses, further supported by a wave of companies that are required to comply with e-invoicing regulation effective from January 1, 2024); (ii) the growth of our cross-selling solutions and the contribution from upselling and “more-for-more” campaigns, as well as the revenue contribution of the bolt-on acquisitions we made between May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2024, the results of which were not reflected in our results for the five months ended May 31, 2023. In addition, based on preliminary results derived from our unaudited management accounts and other information currently available to us, we estimate that for the five months ended May 31, 2024, we generated Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €139.9 million, an increase of approximately €29.7 million (or 27.0%) compared to Adjusted EBITDA of approximately €110.2 million for the five months ended May 31, 2023. We estimate that this increase was mainly attributable to solid organic growth of 17.6% period-over-period underpinned by less than proportional operating cost increases, primarily due to increased operational efficiency and lower incidence of certain non-personnel costs as well as the positive contribution of the bolt-on acquisitions we made between ----- May 31, 2023 and May 31, 2024, the results of which were not reflected in our results for the five months ended May 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The remaining share capital of the Issuer is indirectly owned by Silver Lake (12.37%), Hg (5.45%), Luxinva (9.87%), and CapitalG (2.78%). For a description of our principal shareholders and the shareholder agreement, see “Principal shareholders.” See also “—Recent developments—H&F’s increased shareholding in the _TeamSystem Group.”_ (2) TeamSystem Holdco is incorporated as a joint stock company (società per azioni) under the laws of Italy and is the holding company, and current reporting entity, of the TeamSystem Group.

The issue date of the PIK Notes is expected to occur on or prior to December 31, 2024 and the proceeds of the New PIK Notes are expected to be used by Holdco 3 to refinance its Existing PIK Notes. The PIK Notes will mature in 2032 and will have covenants substantially similar to the covenants of the Notes, as amended to reflect, among other things, the different position of Holdco 3 and the PIK Notes in the capital structure. Interest on the PIK Notes will be payable, at the sole option of Holdco 3, in accordance with applicable provisions of law and the terms and conditions of the PIK Notes, either in cash or in kind or in a combination thereof, and is expected to be serviced by Holdco 3 through dividends or other distributions by the Issuer or its subsidiaries to Holdco 3, subject to the limitations under applicable law. The Shared Collateral (which currently consists of 100% of the share capital of the Issuer held by Holdco 3, as further described under “Summary—The Offering—Security”) is secured on a contractual second-priority basis by operation of the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of the holders of the Existing PIK Notes. Following the Refinancing of the Existing PIK Notes and subject to the obtainment of the Italian Golden Power Clearance, the PIK Notes will be secured on the same basis by the Shared Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the PIK Notes. The Existing PIK Notes are also secured (and following the Refinancing of the Existing PIK Notes and subject to the obtainment of the Italian Golden Power Clearance, the PIK Notes will be secured) on a first-priority basis by pledges over 100% of the share capital of Holdco 3 held by Holdco 2 and Holdco 2’s receivables under any intercompany receivables owing from Holdco 3, if any. The PIK Notes will not be guaranteed by, and will not receive any other credit support from, the Issuer and its subsidiaries. For further information, see “Description of certain financing arrangements—Existing PIK Notes and PIK Notes,” “Description of _Notes—Security,” “Description of Notes—Guarantees” and “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce the Collateral may be restricted by local law.

As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Issuer accounted for 79.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s consolidated total assets, and generated 54.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s total revenue and 47.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, after the elimination of intercompany balances. As of March 31, 2024, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Issuer would have had €1,871.9 million in outstanding external third-party financial indebtedness (excluding €189.2 million of Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries), €1,850.0 million of which was represented by the Notes, the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and €21.9 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16. (5) The Notes will be general, senior obligations of the Issuer, will be secured (subject to the obtainment of the Italian Golden Power Clearance), will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and will rank pari passu in right of payment with the Issuer’s existing and future debt that is not so subordinated, including the Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Notes will be senior obligations of the Issuer and, on or about the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor. The Parent Guarantor also guarantees or will guarantee, as applicable, on a senior basis the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. None of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the subsidiaries of the Issuer. The Guarantee will be subject to certain material contractual and legal limitations. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law _considerations,” “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral.” The Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor_ Agreement and may be subject to release under certain circumstances. See “Description of certain financing arrangements— _Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured by any collateral._ On June 25, 2024, the Issuer, jointly with Holdco 3 and Holdco 2, submitted an application with the Italian Golden Power Authority pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation with respect to the granting or reconfirmation, as applicable, on a first-ranking basis of (i) a pledge over all of the shares of the Issuer held by Holdco 3, and (ii) certain material operating bank accounts of the Issuer opened in Italy (collectively, the “Collateral”). Subject to the Agreed Security Principles and certain perfection requirements, the Notes will be secured on a first-ranking basis by the Collateral, within 30 Business Days from and excluding the later of (i) the Issue Date and (ii) the Italian Golden Power Clearance Date. If the Italian Golden Power Clearance is not obtained, the Notes will remain unsecured obligations of the Issuer. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—The Golden Power Legislation is applicable to the Issuer _and the Group”, “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—The security interests in the Collateral will be granted within 30 Business Days from and excluding the later of (i) the Issue Date and (ii) the Italian Golden Power Clearance Date” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantee and the Collateral—On the Issue Date, the Notes will not be secured. The Notes will be secured by the Collateral only once we obtain the Italian Golden Power Clearance and the outcome of such process is uncertain. Moreover, any enforcement of the Collateral will require clearance by the Italian Golden Power Authority.” The_ Collateral also secures or will secure, as applicable, on a first-ranking basis the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to such hedging obligations have been repaid in full. Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Shared Collateral (as defined herein) is secured, or will be secured, as applicable, on a contractual second-priority basis by operation of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein) for the benefit of the holders of the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, following their issuance, subject to the obtainment of the Italian Golden Power Clearance, the PIK Notes. The security interests in the Collateral may be released under certain circumstances and, subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Collateral may be ----- pledged to secure future indebtedness. The Collateral will be subject to certain material limitations pursuant to applicable laws. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations,” “Risk _factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability,” “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There are circumstances other than the repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral will be released automatically without your consent or the consent of_ the Trustee or the Security Agent,”_ “Description of certain financing arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of _Notes—Security.”_ (6) To further support our liquidity and align the size of the Revolving Credit Facility with the growth of the business, on or prior to the Issue Date and subject to completion of the Offering and the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent, certain lenders including certain of the existing lenders and one or more new lenders are expected to participate in an upsize of the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility from €180.0 million to approximately €300.0 million through the Revolving Credit Facility Amendment. As part of the Revolving Credit Facility Amendment, the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility is expected be extended to mature on the RCF Maturity Date, _provided that, to the extent that more than €200.0 million of the Existing Senior Secured Notes remain outstanding as at the date falling six months prior to First Existing Senior Secured Notes Maturity Date, the RCF Maturity Date shall be adjusted at such time to be the date falling three months prior to the First Existing Senior Notes Maturity Date, and subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence covenants and related definitions will be amended on or about the Issue Date to align to the equivalent covenants and definitions of the Notes as will be set out in the Indenture. See “Summary—The Transactions—Revolving Credit Facility _Amendment.” We expect that the €15.0 million of drawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility as of the Issue Date will be repaid_ in full in connection with the Offering (without a corresponding cancellation of commitments thereunder). The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed on a senior basis by the Parent Guarantor and any other entities that may, in the future, guarantee the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Notes and is secured on a first-priority basis over the same Collateral that secures or will secure, as applicable, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Notes and certain hedging obligations, subject to the applicable contractual and legal limitations. Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Notes will receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and counterparties to such hedging obligations have been repaid in full. See “Description _of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Subject to certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Issuer_ may become borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility. (7) No subsidiary of the Issuer will guarantee the Notes. As of March 31, 2024, after giving _pro forma_ effect to the Transactions, the Issuer’s subsidiaries would have had €11.0 million in outstanding external third-party financial indebtedness, €7.8 million of which was represented by lease obligations under IFRS 16, which would have ranked structurally senior to the Notes and the Guarantee. Claims of creditors of non-guarantor subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those subsidiaries and minority stockholders of such subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer and the Guarantor, including holders of the Notes. The Notes and the Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors), preferred stockholders (if any) and minority stockholders of such non-guarantor subsidiaries. See “Risk factors—Risks _related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the existing or future indebtedness or obligations of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.” Certain of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are operated through strategic_ partnerships with other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in such subsidiaries. For further information, see “Management’s _discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Contractual obligations—Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries” and “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ from our interests.

See “Description of Notes—Withholding _Taxes.”_ The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Italy and therefore payments of principal and interest on the Notes and, in certain circumstances, any gain on the Notes, will be subject to Italian tax laws and regulations.

(1) Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS. This measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income from continuing operations or any other measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity prepared in accordance with IFRS. “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to Profit (Loss) for the relevant period excluding the effect of (i) income taxes, (ii) share of profit (loss) of associates, finance income and finance costs, monetary gain (loss), (iii) impairment of non-current assets, (iv) other provisions for risks and charges, (v) depreciation and amortization of non-current assets, (vi) allowance for bad debts and (vii) certain items that we consider not to be core to our ongoing business, as described in the table below. “Adjusted EBITDA margin” refers to Adjusted EBITDA for the relevant period divided by total revenue for the same period. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information with respect to our overall operating performance and debt service capacity by facilitating comparisons of operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of items not directly resulting from core operations. Adjusted EBITDA is the main measure management uses to assess the trading performance of our business and, therefore, we believe it may be helpful to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to assist in their assessment of the trading performance of our business. We note, however, that Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered a substitute measure to operating profit, operating profit margin, as an indicator of operating performance, as an alternative to operating cash flows or as a measure of our liquidity.

(3) _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is subject to the same limitations as Adjusted EBITDA. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to project our results of operations or financial condition for any historical or future period. Our presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the presentation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In particular, the pro forma adjustments relating to certain cost saving initiatives and our annualized revenue in respect of our customer subscription arrangements used to calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are based on a number of assumptions made in reliance on the information available to us and management’s judgments based on such information. The available information is preliminary and the assumptions used in estimating these _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA components are inherently uncertain, forward looking in nature and subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic, and competitive risks and uncertainties. We cannot assure you that the information on which we have based our assumptions will not change or that we will be able to realize any of the as-yet unrealized cost savings or revenue benefits we believe are possible based on these management estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit. Accordingly, this information does not represent the results we would have achieved (x) had the cost saving initiatives been implemented as of April 1, 2023 and (y) had all of the relevant subscription agreements relating to our key cloud products (existing as of March 31, 2024) been in place as of April 1, 2023 and had all subscription fees thereunder been regularly paid by our customers for the entire relevant period. In addition, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes a pro forma adjustment for the EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA contribution of certain bolt-on acquisitions for the periods, some of which have not yet been completed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, as further specified in footnote (a) to the table below. Such adjustment does not reflect the costs we will incur to, among other things, integrate such businesses into the Group or any potential revenue or cost synergies or other impacts related to or expected to derive from such acquisitions, and, therefore, is not meant to represent what the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of such businesses would have been for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 if we had acquired such businesses on April 1, 2023. Neither our independent auditors, nor any other independent accountants, have compiled, examined, or performed any procedures with respect to the Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA measures contained herein, nor have they expressed any opinion or any other form of assurance on such information or its achievability. In addition, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the underlying calculations thereof have not been, and cannot be, audited, reviewed or verified by any independent accounting firm. Pro _Forma Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Offering Memorandum because we believe that it provides a useful indication of what our_ Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 would have been under certain circumstances and assumptions as described herein; however, this information does not constitute a measure of financial performance under IFRS or any other auditing standard, and you should not consider Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with IFRS or any other auditing standard or as a measure of our results of operations or liquidity. See “Risk _factors—Risks related to our business—We have presented certain adjusted and pro forma financial information in this Offering Memorandum that is based upon management estimates including in respect of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for certain cost saving initiatives, annualized recurring revenues, Adjusted EBITDA generated from bolt-on acquisitions. The relevance of these measures depends upon the accuracy of a series of estimates and assumptions involving factors that are beyond our control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.”_ The following table provides a reconciliation from Adjusted EBITDA to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024:",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

See “Presentation of financial and other information—General—The Issuer.” (a) Represents (x) an amount of €20.4 million corresponding to the aggregate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 (or, if such data was not available for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the year ended December 31, 2023) of the businesses that we acquired during such period, minus the EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA contribution (if any) of each such business from the relevant date of first consolidation in the TeamSystem Group to March 31, 2024 (which is already reflected in our Adjusted EBITDA for such period), plus (y) an amount of €11.4 million corresponding to the expected aggregate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2024 (or, if such data was not available for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the year ended December 31, 2023), based on our management’s internal estimates, of the businesses that we acquired (or in respect of which we entered into an acquisition agreement) between April 1, 2024 and the date of this Offering Memorandum.

See: “Risks Factors— _Risks related to our business—Any expansion of our business outside of Italy may present risks.” See also “—Recent developments—Bolt-on acquisitions.”_ (b) Represents estimated average annual cost savings which we expect to realize between 2024 and 2025, and the majority of which we expect to realize in 2024, from a number of initiatives that we fully launched between 2023 and 2024, which are all ongoing as planned as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These initiatives are related to several areas of our organization, including administration and finance, facility expenses management, information and communications technology (ICT) and procurement, R&D, customer service and delivery and sales. In particular, these initiatives include, among other things: (i) centralization and cost optimization of general and administrative activities and IT procurement and optimization of facility footprint (€1.8 million); (ii) further centralization or reorganization of selected customer support and delivery teams to improve efficiency (€1.7 million); (iii) further optimization of personnel costs (€0.7 million); (iv) outsourcing of additional HR tasks to external providers (€0.1 million); (v) optimization of Cloud infrastructure and creation of synergies between R&D teams (€2.0 million); (vi) increase of sales productivity and digital sales (€0.9 million); and (vii) implementation of other efficiencies, including optimization of thirdparty software spending, streamlining of senior management, streamlining of marketing technology and communication tools portfolio, and reduction of Cloud infrastructure cost base (€2.6. million). For further information on these cost saving initiatives, see “—Summary historical financial information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data” and “—We have presented _certain adjusted and pro forma financial information in this Offering Memorandum that is based upon management estimates including in respect of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for certain cost saving initiatives, annualized recurring revenues, Adjusted EBITDA generated from bolt-on acquisitions. The relevance of these measures depends upon the accuracy of a series of estimates and assumptions involving factors that are beyond our control and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors.” We do not expect to incur significant costs in connection with the full realization of these annual cost savings._ (c) Represents the difference between (i) the annual subscription fees in respect of all of the subscription agreements relating to certain of our key products, including cloud versions of our core ERP solutions, Fatture in Cloud, other In Cloud products and TS Digital Invoice that were in place as of March 31, 2024, net of all subscription fees associated with churning customers who delivered termination notices on or prior to March 31, 2024, for an aggregate amount of €719.3 million, and (ii) an amount of 684.2 million representing the revenue we actually generated pursuant to the subscription agreements relating to such key cloud products in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe that this is a reasonable estimate given that (a) the revenue from the sale of such key cloud products derives from the payment of recurring and contracted annual subscription fees and (b) for the calculation of this adjustment, we have disregarded the subscription fees associated with churning customers in such period. See: “Risks Factors— _Risks related to our business—The market for cloud-based applications may develop more slowly than we expect or we may have difficulties to continue transitioning our traditional customer base to cloud technology.”_ (d) Represents the negative Adjusted EBITDA contributions from TeamSystem Holdco and the intermediate holding companies sitting between TeamSystem Holdco and the Issuer within the corporate structure of the TeamSystem Group (amounting to €0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, and €0.1 million and €0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively). ----- (4) _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (€412.2 million) divided by pro forma total revenue (€895.8 million), which represents our total revenue for the period (€778.7 million) plus (i) (x) an amount of €49.3 million corresponding to the total revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 of the businesses that we acquired during such period, minus the total revenue contribution (if any) of each such business to our total revenues from the relevant date of first consolidation in the TeamSystem Group to March 31, 2024 (which is already reflected in our total revenue for such period), _plus_ (y) an amount of €28.9 million corresponding to the expected total revenue, based on our management’s internal estimates, for the year ended December 31, 2023 of the businesses that we acquired (or in respect of which we entered into an acquisition agreement) between April 1, 2024 and the date of this Offering Memorandum; plus (ii) an amount of €35.1 million representing the annualized revenue corresponding to the difference between (a) the annual subscription fees in respect of all of the subscription agreements relating to our key cloud products (e.g., Fatture in Cloud, cloud version of our core ERP products) that were in place as of March 31, 2024, net of all subscription fees associated with churning customers who delivered termination notices on or prior to March 31, 2024, for an aggregate amount of €719.3 million, and (b) the revenue we actually generated pursuant to the subscription agreements relating to such key cloud products in the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, for an aggregate amount of €684.2 million. We are adding these incremental estimated pro forma adjustments to our total revenue for the calculation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 in light of the fact that our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for such period has also been adjusted for these items. For further information on these two pro forma adjustments, see footnote (3) above. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin and pro forma total revenue are not recognized measures of financial performance or profitability under IFRS and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS financial measures.” (5) _Pro forma_ cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets represents cash and bank balances _plus other current and non-current financial assets as of March 31, 2024 as adjusted for the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on March 31, 2024, as further described in footnote (1) under “Capitalization.” See also “Use of proceeds” and “Presentation of financial and other information— _General—The Issuer.”_ (6) _Pro forma adjusted net financial debt gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024 and represents Pro _forma adjusted financial debt less_ _Pro forma cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets. See “Capitalization” and “Use of proceeds.” Pro forma adjusted net financial debt does not include amounts outstanding as of the Issue Date under the Revolving Credit_ Facility (if any). Pro forma adjusted net financial debt has not been prepared in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our net financial debt would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our net financial debt for any future period or our financial condition at any future date. _Pro forma adjusted net financial debt is not a recognized measure of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS financial measures.” See “Capitalization.” (7) _Pro forma adjusted senior secured net financial debt gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on March 31, 2024, and consists of our indebtedness represented by the Notes, the Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Floating Rate Notes _less_ _Pro forma cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets. Pro forma adjusted senior secured net financial debt is not a recognized_ measure of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. (8) _Pro forma adjusted net interest expense represents estimated net interest expense related to the Issuer Pro forma adjusted net financial debt for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, as if the Transactions had occurred on April 1, 2023 and assuming that the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn for the entire period. This estimate reflects the issuance of €700.0 million Notes carrying an interest rate of three-month EURIBOR (subject to a 0% floor) plus            % (assuming the three-month EURIBOR rate as of           was in effect for the entire period). Pro forma adjusted net interest expense also includes, among others, interest accruing on €29.7 million of IFRS 16 lease liabilities that we expect will remain outstanding following the Transactions and is calculated gross of the debt issuance costs in connection with the Transactions. _Pro forma adjusted net interest expense does not include commitment fees on undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pro forma adjusted net interest expense does not include any interest on the Existing PIK Notes, which are a secured obligation of Holdco 3. Pro forma adjusted net interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest expense would have actually been had the Transactions occurred on the date assumed, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.1,"If we fail to maintain, expand or develop our relationships with our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected","The success of our business depends largely on our ability to maintain good relationships with our existing customers to benefit from such relationships in order to increase our sales to the existing customer base and to attract and develop relationships with new customers. For example, our strategy contemplates an increase in cross selling and upselling initiatives of our products and services to our existing customer base. Moreover, we have been developing relationships with both existing and new customers by introducing new solutions based on new technologies, such as a comprehensive platform of SaaS services and extensive API, in response to the changing technological environment. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining, expanding or developing our relationships with customers, and if we are not successful, we may lose important sales opportunities, customers and share in the field. Our Customer Retention Rate is driven by a variety of factors, such as our ability to continue to (i) develop and maintain our products and (ii) recruit and retain qualified personnel to provide high-quality customer service for our products. The Customer Retention Rate may also decrease as a consequence of certain product and service price adjustments which we engage at the beginning of the year as part of our continuous improvement of our product offering or, in our Micro Solutions business unit, upon renewals throughout the year. Our “more-formore” pricing strategy, which involves repositioning our existing customers to more advanced or premium versions of our products and services, has been instrumental in driving the increase in our average return per user (“ARPU”). While this strategy aims to enhance customer value and maximize revenue, it carries the risk of increasing customer churn. Customers may perceive the higher costs associated with premium offerings as unjustified, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and a decision to switch to competitors’ products or services. If we are unable to effectively demonstrate the added value of our premium versions or if the perceived cost-benefit balance does not meet customer expectations, we may experience a higher rate of customer attrition, which could negatively impact our financial performance and competitive position. Generally, customers who wish to cancel their contracts following a price adjustment have less than a month to do so. Otherwise, customers in our Professional Solutions and Enterprise Solutions business units can cancel their contracts by giving six months’ notice of cancellation prior to their next contract annual renewal date, while our other customers may only cancel on the relevant renewal date. As a result, some end-customer churn driven by price adjustments may therefore occur several months after the price adjustment, making it difficult for us to estimate the impact of price adjustments on our Customer Retention Rate. We cannot guarantee that any future price adjustment will not decrease our Customer Retention Rate. Our Customer Retention Rate for micro and small business customers is generally lower than our Customer Retention Rate for enterprise and professional customers, and this is mainly due to the lower complexity of micro and small business customers’ software solutions which results in lower switching costs. If the contribution to our business of the Micro Solutions business unit and therefore the micro and small business customer segment continue to increase, in line with the growth we experienced between December 31, 2021 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our overall Customer Retention Rate may decrease, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. See “Certain Definitions— _Customer Retention Rate.”_ ----- In addition, our dedicated team of Customer Success Management helps us build and maintain good relationships with our customers, which is critical to our reputation and, ultimately, our business. While we have outsourced a small part of our customer support operations to Comdata Group to enable us to more efficiently manage increased assistance requests from our customers during peak times, we have an internal team of approximately 40 specialists, of which 15 are dedicated to a limited group of high value customers, who provide customer support and other assistance and maintenance services directly to our customers. If our internal team or, to a lesser extent, our external specialists do not provide adequate levels of assistance to our customers, our customer satisfaction may decline and our Customer Retention Rate may decrease, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we believe that our delivery operating model (which includes the on-site installation, configuration and customization of our products) plays a relevant role in enabling our distribution and service channels to meet customer expectations and drive revenue growth. While most products for micro and small businesses customers do not require delivery services and we outsource to System Integrators most of the delivery services in respect of the majority of our products targeting SME customers, we have an internal team of project managers and technical consultants specialized in the delivery of products directed at our professional customers and customers. Despite reinforcing our delivery model over the past few years by increasing the number of System Integrators and consultants, establishing a standardized contractual framework, and implementing quality assurance policies and training programs, System Integrators and consultants remain independent contractors. This factor limits our control over such System Integrators’ and consultants’ actions and potentially impacts our business and reputation. Moreover, if our internal team or external specialists (i.e. System Integrators), as applicable, do not perform efficiently or in a timely manner, we may experience disruptions in the delivery process, which can negatively impact our business processes and reputation among our customers.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.2,We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions internationally and in Italy,"Our business may be negatively affected by a number of factors that are beyond our control, such as general macroeconomic conditions, volatility in the global capital and credit markets, geopolitical events and other general political and economic developments globally and in the sectors in which we operate. Recent years have been challenging for the world economy, due in part to political turmoil and/or upheaval in a number of regions, which has resulted in high currency volatility and tumultuous markets. Despite an improvement in global economic conditions since 2021, following the sharp global economic downturn in 2020 resulting from the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the outlook for the global economy remains highly uncertain, and certain markets, including Europe, may not achieve the growth rates that they have forecasted or historically observed. Such uncertainty has been recently exacerbated by the global turmoil resulting from the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, which has resulted in severe political, social and economic consequences in the countries directly involved in the conflict as well as more broadly on the European continent, as tensions between Russia, the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries continue to increase. Among other things, the ongoing war in Ukraine has also been a driver behind a significant surge in energy and transportation prices in 2022, which have been, and may continue to be, a key factor in driving inflationary pressure and may ultimately adversely affect general economic conditions and in turn our results of operations. The risk of further intensification of the conflict in Ukraine remains high, and there is a potential risk of further escalation and a spreading of the war to other regions. Although we do not have any material exposure to Russia, we continue to closely monitor the ongoing conflict and the potential and impact on our operations. The extent and duration of the conflict, the implementation of further sanctions and any related market disruptions are impossible to predict and we cannot be certain that they will not have an impact on our operations. Separately, in early October 2023, Hamas and Israel began an armed conflict which may potentially spread to surrounding Middle Eastern countries. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we do not have any exposure to Israel and have not faced any material consequences of the local conflict on our international sales. However, to a limited extent, an escalation may still impact our customers, particularly in our Market Specific Solutions business unit, due to, amongst others, increased logistic costs resulting from the spillover effects of the conflict on transportation infrastructure and trade routes. The length, outcome and consequences of the Hamas-Israeli military conflict remain highly unpredictable, and we cannot exclude that it will negatively impact any of our customers and, as a result, our ability, amongst others, to collect trade receivables or maintain our sales volumes. The tensions arising from the conflict in Ukraine coupled with a potential escalation of the ongoing military confrontation between Israel and Hamas (and its spillover effects throughout the Middle East, including the impact on shipping through the Red Sea) as well as any tensions ----- between the United States and China, including as a result of an exacerbation of the trade war between the two countries, or further geopolitical tensions related to the upcoming presidential elections in the United States could also further increase other political tensions and hamper international trade. Any energy and logistics issues, further political and economic instability and escalating geopolitical tensions in Europe or globally could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products, business, results of operations and financial conditions. Following the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”), post-Brexit changes, such as intensified border checks, have disrupted trade and created uncertainty, which could potentially affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, and distributors in the UK and the broader European market. Concerns about the stability of the euro and its suitability as a single currency for diverse Eurozone economies sometimes resurge. Any departure from the euro by member countries, or the euro’s potential dissolution, could severely impact the European economy, including the Italian economy. An Italian euro exit would increase our exposure to currency fluctuations and might lead to exchange controls and other economic measures. Political instability in Italy, Europe (including from recent European Parliament elections) or globally could reduce demand for our products and negatively affect our operations for an indeterminate period. As Italy is a key sales and R&D area for us, such events could harm our business. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our operations in Italy represented approximately 93% of our total revenue. As a result, macroeconomic conditions and market trends in Italy impact our results of operations. A downturn in the Italian economy, including as a result of external factors such as the military confrontation between Russia and Ukraine and the Hamas-Israeli conflict, or a protracted inflationary surge, could negatively affect the labor market, creditworthiness of certain of our customers and other counterparties. Declining or stagnating gross domestic product, increasing or stagnating unemployment and generally unfavorable conditions in the Italian financial markets and political instability in the country may also cause a reduction in customer spending and investment in digital solutions, thereby resulting in lower demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of our sales. Prevailing market interest rates, overall inflation levels and energy and logistics costs may result in supply chain disruptions and impact our operations and results of operations. In particular, the material increases in global inflation since early 2022 forced central banks of the major world economies to significantly increase market interest rates in a very short timeframe, ending the lengthy period of low interest rates. Even though global inflation levels and interest rates have decreased in 2024, they continue to remain high and economic growth may be negatively impacted, which in turn may adversely affect our business, operations and financial performance, including by reducing our ability to fund organic growth through capital expenditures and by increasing the cost to access financing. Partly as a result of the interest rate surge in 2023, the banking sector experienced significant pressures both in the United States and in Europe, which in certain cases required an immediate governmental intervention. In the event of failure or financial distress of any of our lenders or financial counterparties, we may be unable to access deposits or undrawn amounts under our facilities in a timely fashion or at all, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund our ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes. Similarly, if any of our customers were unable to access their funds with their lenders or financial counterparties, their ability to pay their obligations to us or to enter into new arrangements requiring additional payments to us could be materially adversely affected. In addition, investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, which could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or limited access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations or result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations. Finally, significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, including renewed waves of COVID-19 infections or outbreaks of other diseases, may result in widespread health crises that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries. Such impacts could induce economic downturns affecting industries our customers operate in, potentially leading to customer bankruptcies, insolvencies, or decreased investments in software solutions, adversely affecting our liquidity and growth. For example, in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a negative effect on our customers in the Market Specific Solutions business unit which operate in the HORECA industries, as it was significantly affected by restrictive measures implemented by public authorities, including the Italian government. To the extent that a communicable disease outbreak adversely affects our business, results of operation, financial condition and prospects, as well as our ability to perform our obligations under the Notes, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. ----- As businesses face decreasing volumes of activity and experience cash flow problems, the demand for our services and products could decrease. In addition, as we continue to grow in size, both organically or through bolt-on acquisitions, we may become increasingly exposed to macroeconomic conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.3,Data security breaches could have a significant negative impact on our business and our customers,"We operate in the IT industry and, as part of our business, we collect and retain large volumes of data, including financial, personally identifying and other sensitive information, pertaining, amongst others, to us, our customers and personnel and our customers’ customers and personnel. Our IT systems record, process, store, elaborate, summarize and report such data. Our and our customers’ collection and use of this data might raise privacy and security concerns and even the perceived weakness of our IT systems could negatively impact our business or the demand for our products and services. Moreover, despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential and personal data and information, unauthorized users could gain access to our systems through cyber-attacks and introduce backdoors or steal, use without authorization, destroy or sabotage such data. We consider financially motivated cybercrimes to be among the top current threats to our data, due to their high degree of sophistication, their ability to exploit system vulnerabilities as well as result in identity thefts. Such breaches and cyberattacks could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and our customers’ systems provided by us and potential unauthorized disclosure or misuse of sensitive or confidential information, including personal data of, among others, our or our customers’ employees, customers, contractors, vendors and other business partners, as well as personal data stored on our products or through our services by our customers, which may result in, amongst others, losses, damage to our reputation and brand and adversely affect our relationships with our customers. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving and have increased in sophistication and speed in recent years, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and defending against them. The risk of such attacks includes breaches and attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also of those of our customers, advisors, employees, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties as well as of third-party systems on which we rely to operate our digital platforms. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of our data or systems or those of our customers or other third parties, theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means, and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. There is a growing trend of advanced persistent threats being launched by organized and coordinated groups against corporate networks to breach security for malicious purposes. Computer hackers may also be able to develop and deploy computer viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that could attack our products and services, exploit potential security vulnerabilities of our products and services, create system disruptions and cause shutdowns or denials of service. In addition, data security thefts or other cyber-attacks may target the third-party infrastructure operators that manage the servers underlying our cloud platform, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Aruba, which could in turn adversely affect our operations and relationships with our customers. Any of these events could lead to reputational damage, litigation brought by our customers or business partners and inquiries and investigations from governmental authorities. Data may also be accessed or modified improperly as a result of employee or supplier error or malfeasance and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as user names, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our data, our customers’ data or our IT systems. In the event of any such attacks or actions, we, our customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, penalties, fines, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as to the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. As a result, any breach of our IT security or the IT security of our third-party service providers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks will increase as we continue to expand our cloud product offerings and services and store and process increasingly large amounts of our customers’ confidential information and data and host or manage parts of our customers’ businesses in cloud-based IT environments, especially in customer sectors involving particularly sensitive data. We also have acquired a number of companies, products, services and technologies over the years. Even though we make significant efforts as part our integration process to address any IT, cybersecurity, compliance and data ----- protection issues through a detailed assessment and remediation action implementation, we may still inherit such risks when we integrate these or future acquisitions within our business. As our business grows and the cybersecurity landscape evolves, we may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. However, there can be no assurance that such investments will prevent future cyberattacks or other threats from occurring which may result in material adverse effects on our business and operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks related to our business,13.1.4,Competition from large or established competitors and local specialized competitors could have a negative impact on our business and financial condition,"The Italian ERP sector is highly competitive and we compete with a variety of smaller local software companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, including Sistemi and Dylog. If any of our competitors offer lower prices or more favorable payment or other contractual terms, warranties or functionality which we are not able to match or currently do not offer, we may be required to lower our prices or offer other favorable terms in order to compete successfully and avoid a decrease in our customer retention rate, which could lower our margins and negatively affect our results of operations and share within the field. In addition, if our competitors are able to offer better customer service and/or are more effective than us in promoting their products, they may be able, including through dedicated promotions or other marketing activities, to cause the migration of some of our existing customers to their solutions, and we might be unable to continue to attract new customers. Furthermore, market consolidation involving our competitors could lead to the creation of fewer and larger specialized groups which could further reduce our ability to successful compete within our Italian reference segments. For example, in June 2024, the Zucchetti group acquired the Ranocchi Software group and NTS Informatica to strengthen its competitive position for solutions dedicated to companies and professionals. The risks deriving from competition are higher in our Micro Solutions business unit, as software for micro and small businesses and professional customers, such as our Fatture in Cloud software, is simpler, more standardized and requires less customization and no delivery services compared to software solutions for larger enterprises and professionals. This could adversely affect our approximately share for the micro and small businesses customer segment as the risks of new market entrants would be higher. Furthermore, we currently have a number of additional specialized competitors, such as Aruba, which provide electronic invoicing services, performing some of the more basic functions currently performed by our products, but at a lower price. Additionally, we also compete with Poste Italiane for our SPID services and with SolidWorks for CAD/CAM services. If we are unable to continue providing high-quality products and services that distinguish us from our competitors, the competition of other providers could adversely affect our established position and result in a loss of share in our reference segments. In addition, larger conglomerates against which we compete, for instance, in Italy and Spain, such as Cegid, and may compete also in other countries in the future, including as a result of our international expansion strategy, may acquire new businesses, develop competitive solutions, benefit from economies of scale and larger customer bases. For example, in May 2024, Visma announced the acquisition of Fiscozen to expand its presence in Italy. Such strategies could be leveraged to accelerate their competitive positions, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, although well-established industry players such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP have historically focused on large enterprises and do not currently compete directly with us, if such players were to expand into the Italian SME, micro and small businesses or professional ERP and business management software segment, we may be unable to compete effectively against them, due to the fact that such players have greater financial, technical, marketing and human resources, greater brand recognition, greater international presence and a longer operating and product development history than we do. For example, large operating and database system developers, such as Microsoft and Oracle, could introduce new operating systems, database systems, new software and computer hardware that incorporate features and functions currently performed by our products, which could adversely affect our competitive position, or could require substantial modification of our products to maintain compatibility with these companies’ hardware or software. Furthermore, international companies which focus on SMEs and professionals (e.g., Xero, Gruppo WKI, Cegid, Visma and Intuit), may decide in the future to enter the Italian market and introduce solutions that may compete with our solutions. See “Industry—Competition.” In addition, our competitors may consolidate or form alliances with each other in the future, either internationally or with local software companies. The successful consolidation of two or more of our competitors could result in the combination of their resources and technological capabilities, improved access to a wider customer base and improved economies of scale. This could lead to intensified competition and a loss of share in our reference ----- segments. If we are unable to compete effectively against such consolidated companies or alliances, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Accordingly, our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to further develop our strategic and technical expertise, anticipate and respond in a timely manner to emerging industry standards and other technological and regulatory changes or trends, enhance our current services and develop new software products, technologies and services that meet changing customer needs. For example, while we design our software products to work with various industry-standard system platforms, there may be current or future platforms, or new development tools for existing platforms, that are not compatible with our software products. Moreover, certain existing or future operating environments or user interfaces that are not architecturally compatible with our current software product design may achieve popularity within the business application marketplace, reducing the possibility to integrate third-party solutions or limiting our ability to acquire new customers. Developing and maintaining consistent software product performance across these various platforms, operating environments and interfaces could require significant investment. We may need to significantly increase our expenditures in order to maintain and adapt software performance across widely used platforms and operating environments, as well as to achieve market acceptance of platforms, operating environments and interfaces that are compatible with our products, or to adapt to popular new platforms, operating environments, interfaces and new development tools, and our revenues, margins and results of operations may, as a result, be adversely affected. In order for our business to remain competitive and grow in this rapidly evolving sector, we must continually adapt, enhance and expand our existing technological and service offerings, as well as develop new products and services to keep pace with technological, regulatory and market developments, by, among other things, dedicating significant efforts and resources to our research and development activities. See “Business—Research and _Development (“R&D”).” If we fail to accurately foresee the direction of the ERP industry or if we do not dedicate_ adequate and sufficient resources to our research and development efforts, any new products or service we develop may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate significant revenues, or even sufficient revenues to cover the costs incurred in developing such software or service. Further, the success of new software in our industry also often depends on the ability to be the first player to launch such new software in the market, and our failure to do so in respect of any particular product or service could limit our ability to recover the development expenses associated with such product or service. While we are progressively migrating towards a “platformization” approach, which we expect will enhance our scalability and reduce our time-to-market, we face the risk of increased competition from large international players. It cannot be assured that we will be able to compete effectively against them, due to the fact that such players have greater financial, technical, marketing and human resources, greater brand recognition, greater international presence and a longer operating and product development history than we do. In addition, if we are unable to predict or adapt to emerging industry standards and other technological and regulatory changes and do not succeed in producing high-quality software products, enhancements, and releases in a timely and cost-effective manner to compete with applications and other technologies offered by our competitors, our revenue and results of operations might be adversely affected. We may also experience increased customer churn, lower Customer Retention Rates as well as the subsequent migration of our customers to our competitors’ products and services. Such migration may lead to a loss of share in our reference segments, which could have a further material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We generally require our customers to pay for our maintenance services in advance, while for licensing and other services, we usually invoice them upon delivery of the relevant service or at the month end for all services provided within that period. We may experience a higher than normal level of delayed payments or non-payments by our customers if their economic conditions are weakened or distressed, including as a result of macroeconomic downturns or tightening credit markets, which could negatively impact our working capital as ----- our trade receivables remain outstanding for a significant period of time or could result in an increase in bad debts and cancellations, as well as in a reduction or delay in revenue collection, which could negatively impact our liquidity and cash flow generation. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our allowance for bad debts was €3.8 million (or 0.9% of our total revenue), €5.5 million (or 1.0% of our total revenue), €7.0 million (or 1.0% of our total revenue) and €7.3 million (or 0.9% of our total revenue), respectively. See “—We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or _political conditions internationally and in Italy.”_ Finally, if we underestimate the amounts needed for our allowance for bad debts or if our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, we may not be able to meet our working capital needs or debt service requirements and our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We believe that the brand awareness, preference and loyalty that our end-customers show for these brands are an important competitive advantage. We rely on several marketing initiatives to launch new products and services and strengthen our brand names. We incur expenses associated with the development and marketing of our new products in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with these offerings. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the costs associated with our marketing activities amounted to €22.5 million, or 2.9% of our total revenues. When we develop a new product or acquire a new business and integrate its products in our offer, we usually invest in communication and marketing activities to launch and promote such new products. In particular, we make substantial investments on digital campaigns and other marketing activities in connection with our products for micro and small businesses, as we believe the ability to attract new micro and small businesses customers is strongly correlated to marketing investments. For example, we engage in various marketing activities, including on-field events tailored to specific solutions or newly launched products. We also engage in general online advertising to increase our brand awareness and mass marketing efforts including sponsorship agreements, such as with the Italian national football team. We must manage our advertising and marketing costs effectively in order to maintain satisfactory operating margins and return on our marketing investment and convert brand awareness into actual product purchases. However, our marketing efforts might not generate the expected degree of brand recognition, nor promote growth in the number of customers or expansion of sales volume that we expect, which could result in a lower return or losses from our marketing investment, lower sales of our products and services and more limited growth and possibility to invest in new products’ development in the future. Although we actively monitor the value and effectiveness of our marketing investments, there can be no assurance that these initiatives will yield the expected returns. If we stop such activities because they are not profitable, the costs we incurred to promote these investments would not be recoverable, in whole or in part, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, maintaining the reputation of, and the value associated with, our brand names is central to the success of our business and there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this objective.

If we are unable to maintain and improve our IT systems and applications, we may experience delays in software and product development, breaches of data security, loss of critical data and system interruptions. Our systems and operations are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss or other telecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters, which have become more prevalent due to the effects of climate change, computer viruses or software defects, physical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events and errors by our employees or third-party service providers. ----- We may in the future experience system interruptions. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems or deterioration in their performance could impair our ability to develop our software products, fulfil customer orders or maintain certain customer service level requirements. In particular, because many of our products and services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to or failure of the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services to our customers in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or reduced business from current customers. Enhancing our IT systems and applications to achieve improved stability and redundancy may be time-consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. If we are unable to invest in maintaining and improving our IT systems and applications, the likelihood of the occurrence of system interruptions would increase. Moreover, while we have developed certain contingency and disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events, such plans and systems might not be fully redundant or sufficient. Any event that results in damages, interruptions or other disruptions of our IT systems and applications could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for our cloud-based products, the infrastructure on which such products run is owned and operated by third party service providers, such as Microsoft, Amazon and Aruba. Any interruptions or other disruptions affecting the systems or servers operated by such providers would adversely affect our cloud business and, consequently, the business of our customers, which could harm our reputation and lead to customer claims and litigation. It may be difficult or impossible for us to obtain contractual damages from or enforce other claims against such providers on the basis of our contracts with them, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Development work is subject to various risks, including the possible delay of scheduled market launches. Additionally, new products may fail to satisfy our quality standards, meet market needs or the expectations of customers, become obsolete upon their market launch or comply with regulatory requirements. Software products may contain errors or security flaws, especially when first introduced or when new versions are released. If we are not able to rectify such errors or flaws or meet the expectations of our customers, we may experience a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Our customers use our software products for critical aspects of their business and any defects, system errors or other performance problems with our products may adversely affect our customers’ businesses. While our contractual arrangements governing the sale of our software products generally contain provisions that purport to limit our liability to software defects and other performance problems, we cannot assure you that such provisions will be enforceable in all instances or will fully protect us from liability damages. Moreover, if our customers experience a defect or a delay in product upgrade, especially if linked to new regulations, they may decide to terminate our engagement or not to renew contractual arrangements relating to our products and services and seek the comparable products from our competitors. Furthermore, defects or bugs might also impact the installation and start-up of new products to our existing customers or new customers, in which case our customers may delay or withhold the payment of licenses and delivery services. Additionally, the detection and correction of software errors and security flaws can be time-consuming and costly and we may be required to divert resources away from development projects to remedy defects in new or already-existing software products. Significant undetected defects or delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements could affect market acceptance of our software products and harm our competitive advantage, which, in turn, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, although we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, this coverage may not be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such product liability claims and our insurer may disclaim coverage. Our liability insurance also may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, cover sufficient value, or at all.

We believe that cloud technology is increasingly crucial for growing and sustaining our business, and part of our product offering, including Fatture in Cloud, our invoicing software for micro and small businesses customers, Contabilità in Cloud, our FMS software for micro and small businesses customers, Cassa in Cloud, our FMS software for restaurant and retail businesses, and our horizontal solutions (including, among others, TeamSystem Digital Invoice, TeamSystem Digital Sign and TeamSystem Digital Archive), is available only on cloud. In addition, we have developed the cloud-based versions of our most successful on premise software for both SMEs and professionals, such as Enterprise Cloud and Studio Cloud, and we plan to continue transitioning our traditional customer base to cloud-based products and launching new cloud-native services within our Digital ecosystem to complement our offer. See also “Summary—Our strategy—Continue benefitting from our large _customer base to facilitate growth of our innovative cross-segment product suite.” Although we currently benefit_ from the increasing sales of our cloud-based solutions and the successful shift to cloud-based solutions as approximately 92% of our customers have passed to at least one of our cloud-based solutions as of March 31, 2024, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience similar growth or trends going forward. In particular, SMEs currently show a lower cloud adoption rate compared to other customer segments, which could impair our ability to increase our presence in this segment and hinder our ability to exploit upselling opportunities related to our cloud-based solutions. Our ability to effect such transition will be limited by the willingness of such customers and the markets that we serve to accept the new SaaS technology and consequently the new delivery model for applications that they see as critical to the success of their business. Many companies have invested substantial efforts and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software and IT staffing into their businesses and may therefore be reluctant or unwilling to migrate these applications to cloud; in addition, technical difficulties may occur during the migration process and we might be unable to replicate all the customization and software integration provided to our customers with on premise solutions, which could potentially result in the relevant customers refusing to migrate to cloud-based solutions or even deciding to terminate their contract with us. Although we believe these digitalization tailwinds are not expected to reverse in the short- to medium-term, there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to rely on our cloud-based applications. In particular, our customers’ retention of cloud-based solutions may be affected by, among others, the following factors: - the security capabilities, reliability and availability of our cloud-based services or cloud-based services in general; - market concerns with entrusting cloud-based solutions providers to store and manage their data, especially confidential or sensitive data; - the fact that, in the cloud, our products are dependent upon third-party hardware and cloud hosting vendors, all of which must interoperate for end users to achieve their computing goals; - our ability to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction, including with respect to maintaining uptime and system availability standards consistent with market expectations; - our ability to implement upgrades and other changes to our software without disrupting our service; - the level of customization and configuration we offer; - our ability to provide rapid response time during periods of intense activity on customer websites; - the price, performance and availability of competing products and services; - our ability to prevent data breaches and cyber-security attacks at our systems and premises and those we manage on behalf of our customers as well as at cloud platforms; and - the ability of third-party hardware and cloud hosting vendors on which we depend to prevent data breaches and cyber-security attacks at our systems and premises. The market for cloud services may develop faster that we expect. If customers require upgraded or cost efficient cloud solutions that we have not yet developed, or if we cannot meet demand, our Customers Retention Rate could be adversely affected, and each of these could harm our business and prevent us from successfully capitalizing on such growth trends. In addition, international competitors may decide to enter into or further invest the Italian ----- market and introduce their own initiatives which may compete with, or not be compatible with, our cloud solutions. Finally, the technology, the market for cloud services and our business model continue to evolve and we may be unable to compete effectively, generate significant revenues or maintain profitability for our cloudbased offerings, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

For example, as a consequence of the EURIBOR interest rate increase in recent years, our interest payment on the Existing Floating Rate Notes, Existing PIK Notes and Existing Private Notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by €51.6 million, or 70.2%, to €125.0 million from €73.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, partly due to our increased exposure to floating instruments from the issuance of the Existing 2022 Private Notes at the end of 2022. Compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, our interest payment on the Existing Floating Rate Notes, Existing PIK Notes and Existing Private Notes for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by €14.8 million, or 25.2%, from €58.6 million in 2021. In April 2022, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements for a notional amount of €425.0 million and €275.0 million, respectively, in each case terminating on December 15, 2025 (the “Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) to hedge against the fluctuation of the EURIBOR variable interest rate on the Existing Floating Rate Notes. Following the issuance of the Notes, we may consider further hedging against interest rate fluctuations to maintain our interest rate risk management strategy, also depending on the evolution of interest rates and forecasts. As a substantive part of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate, a substantial increase in interest rates could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse conditions in the credit and capital markets could also prevent us from obtaining financing or credit on favorable terms in order to fulfill our financing needs (including the need to refinance or repay our debt obligations, including the Notes). More generally, market volatility or illiquidity, tighter lending standards, sharper focus on credit risk, increased focus on investments that investors could consider safer than our bonds such as government securities and cautious investment sentiments that typically accompanies economic crises or downturns may restrict our ability to tap the debt markets (or similar capital markets) as a source of funding and liquidity. If we are unable to repay our debt obligations or access the credit and capital markets, if and when needed, we may not be able to pursue certain of our business plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Any processing of personally identifiable information of individuals located in the European Economic Area in the course of the provision of services is governed by the European data protection laws and regulations, which restrict our ability to collect, process and use personally identifiable information relating to customers, potential customers, business partners, and employees, including for marketing purposes. Such laws and regulations concern the collection, use, retention, security, processing and transfer of personally identifiable information. In particular, starting from May 25, 2018, our operations are subject to the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of April 27, 2016 (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) and to the Italian Privacy Code (Legislative Decree no. 196/2003, as amended by Legislative Decree no. 101/2018, which ----- adapted Italian rules to GDPR). The GDPR increased both the number and the restrictive nature of the obligations binding us in particular with respect to the collection, processing and use of personally identifiable information. The GDPR, amongst others, provides for: - significant applicable maximum fines, up to the higher of (i) €20 million or (ii) 4% of annual global turnover per breach, as opposed to fines of less than €1 million under the former regime. Fines may be imposed instead of, or in addition to, measures that may be ordered by supervisory authorities (such as the request to cease processing). In addition, according to the Italian Privacy Code, certain criminal sanctions could be applied to individuals involved in unlawful processing activities; - more onerous consent requirements, as consent will always have to be express/opt-in, while implied/opt-out consent has at times been deemed sufficient under the former regime; - onerous transparency and compliance obligations; and - stronger rights for individuals, including an individual “right to be forgotten”, which would require us to permanently delete a user’s personally identifiable information in certain circumstances. We adapted our internal procedures and operations to the requirements imposed by the GDPR. We have appointed a dedicated data protection team, which also includes a Data Protection Officer (a “DPO”) and we have taken actions to ensure the constant and complete implementation of the best practices for compliance with the applicable data protection regulatory framework, including internal incident management procedures and data breach policies. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that we carried out the GDPR implementation effort in an appropriate effective and timely manner, and any related failure in complying with the applicable data protection and privacy regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, every time we acquire a new company, we have to review its internal processes and procedures to ensure consistency with our internal processes and procedures and compliance of the newly acquired company with GDPR, with consequent costs for us. For instance, the European Commission has proposed to replace Directive 2002/58/EC on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E Privacy Directive”) with a new regulation primarily aimed at aligning certain provisions of the E Privacy Directive to the GDPR. The Proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the “E Privacy Regulation”) was published by the European Commission on January 10, 2017 and is currently under analysis before the European Parliament and the European Council. The draft E Privacy Regulation proposes heightened regulatory requirements in connection with unsolicited communications, the use of cookies, security of personally identifiable information, confidentiality of communications, consent, data security and data integrity. In line with the GDPR, breaches of the E Privacy Regulation may result in maximum fines equal to the greater of €20 million and 4% of the annual global turnover of the sanctioned company. Furthermore, the EU institutions intend to increasingly regulate the big data economy, with the goal to increase control and trust of both citizens and companies regarding their data. For instance, on December 22, 2023, Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 (the “Data Act”), was adopted. The Data Act is expected to become applicable on September 12, 2025 and will set forth, among other things, minimum requirements that cloud and computing services providers will be required to meet to facilitate interoperability and enable customers of such providers to switch between equivalent providers and systems. Moreover, in recent years, the EU has proposed new rules and actions for AI with the goal to ensure that advancements in this field are inspired by trust, safety and fundamental rights. In particular, a comprehensive regulation on AI (the “AI Act”) is currently at an advance negotiation phase before the EU Institutions. If, and when, the AI Act enters into effect, it will introduce new obligations for companies providing, distributing, importing and using AI systems and general-purpose AI (“GPAI”) models in the EU. Non-compliance with certain of these obligations are could result in fines of up to €35 million or 7% of the overall annual turnover, whichever is higher. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any applicable data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings, investigations or actions (including class actions) brought against us by governmental entities/agencies or private individuals/entities, significant fines, penalties, judgments and reputational damages to our business, requiring us to change business practices and increasing the costs and complexity of compliance, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Evolving regulation relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs and affect or limit the way through which we collect, process, use, store and transfer personal data.

In addition, we cannot assure you that the relationship with our VARs will not be adversely impacted by our initiatives aimed at fostering sell-out growth and the strategic insourcing of VARs, and any such adverse impact could result in decreased retention rates for our VARs which in turn could have material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

For example, whenever the Italian government introduces a new regulatory obligation (e.g., a new tax digital reporting obligation or tax payment) that requires a dedicated feature to be added to our software products, we create such additional software feature and sell it through Regulatory LTAs, aimed at upgrading the relevant software to facilitate compliance with the new regulatory requirements. Fees from the sale of Regulatory LTAs are paid by our customers on an annual basis, separately from and on top of the relevant customer’s base contract fee (i.e. under assistance and maintenance contracts, subscription agreements or VAR distribution agreements, as applicable) and, accordingly, represent an important source of recurring revenue for us. Should the government cease to introduce changes to the regulatory framework that justify the introduction of Regulatory LTAs, or if the number or frequency of such changes decreases, or if existing Regulatory LTAs become useless following the introduction of new rules, our revenue derived from Regulatory LTAs would be adversely affected, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the sale of our professional education products is in part dependent on the existence of rules that require Italian professionals, such as labor advisors, accountants and fiscal consultants, to comply with continuing professional education requirements. If legal or regulatory requirements change such that any of our current professional education providers no longer qualify as an accredited provider or the products that we offer are no longer required for certain of our professional clients to maintain their professional license, our sales of such products could be adversely affected. Furthermore, regulatory obligations currently in force such as those provided under Italian Law No. 205 of December 27, 2017 (Legge di Bilancio), which introduced the obligation for businesses in Italy with revenues higher than €65 thousand per year (with the exception of healthcare professionals), starting from January 1, 2019, to provide electronic invoices to other businesses with whom they conduct transactions, or under art. 2 par. 1, Legislative Decree No. 127/2015 and act No. 236086/2019 of the Italian Tax Authority, which introduced the requirement for retail micro and small businesses to electronically share receipts with the Italian Tax Authority on a daily basis, may be amended or eliminated in the future. The electronic invoicing requirement has been extended to companies with revenues over €25 thousand as of July 2022 and from January 2024 to all taxable persons established in Italy. Any such circumstances could adversely affect our growth. Other regulatory obligations that could impact our business include the new Italian regulation on corporate crisis introduced in 2022. This regulation mandates that private companies in Italy establish organizational, administrative, and accounting frameworks to identify early potential risks of economic or financial crises. We expect our business to benefit from this new corporate crisis legislation, particularly in terms of our sales to SMEs and professionals. However, given its early stage, it cannot be excluded that the Italian Parliament may amend or eliminate certain provisions, or that the interpretation and application of the law may not be favorable to us. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The System Integrators manage their activities relying on dedicated teams, which have a specific know-how in management and realization of ERP projects. If we do not effectively manage relationships with our System Integrators, if these do not perform efficiently or in a timely manner, or if we experience problems with transitioning the work to them, we may experience disruptions in the delivery process, which can negatively impact our business processes and reputation among our customers. The outsourcing of services and functions exposes us to certain risks. For example, the third-party providers may try to increase their prices or impose contractual terms to our detriment. We may also face the risk that the third party providers fail to deliver the services that we require or that services fail to meet required operating and quality standards. In the event that the services become inadequate at any future time, it may be difficult or impossible to recover monies paid to the third-party service providers, obtain contractual damages to which we may be entitled (if any) or enforce other claims against such providers on the basis of our contracts with them, especially if they become insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, if our contractual arrangements with any third-party provider are terminated or no longer offered on reasonable terms, we may not be able to find an alternative supplier on a timely basis, or at all. In particular, especially when part of our workforce and the related knowhow is transferred to the third party provider as part of the outsourcing, it could be extremely difficult for us to replace the provider in a timely manner, on equivalent terms, without incurring significant expense or at all in the event that such provider ceases to provide the support that we require entirely or at the quality standards that we require, or if the relationship with such provider deteriorates for any other reason. In addition, our employees who have been or will be in the future transferred to outsourcers may make a claim to be re-transferred to us under certain circumstances. As a result of any of these factors, our ability to build and maintain satisfactory relationships with our customers may be limited due to disruption, delay, defect, quality issues, capacity shortage, or other issues adversely affecting the service quality of the third party provider.

In our Market Specific Solutions business unit, in particular, our CAD/CAM and construction products and services are cyclical due to a number of factors. Sales of our software solutions for property construction and management, as well as sales of CAD/CAM products, are particularly affected by economic cycles, as the industries which these products target, such as the mechanical and manufacturing and construction industries, tend to suffer more than others when macroeconomic conditions are challenging. A portion of our revenue from our Professional Solutions business unit are cyclical due to a number of factors. For example, in relation to our professional education products, such factors include: (i) the perception of our professional education products and services offering as being, to a large extent, non-essential to business in periods of economic downturn; (ii) our ability to attract customers to enroll in our training programs and attend our seminars, conventions and virtual sessions and trainings; (iii) customers completing training programs in which they are enrolled; and (iv) changes in the legal or regulatory requirements in Italy governing accreditation of our professional education products and services and requiring certain professionals to attend a minimum number of and/or certain prescribed training programs with accredited providers in order to maintain their license to practice in their respective profession. As such, adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions which impact GDP, tourism and industrial production growth may affect demand for our Market Specific Solutions and industry specific solutions offered to micro customers. See “—We may be adversely affected by uncertainty and/or unfavorable economic and/or political conditions _internationally and in Italy.”_ Accordingly, if our Market Specific Solutions customers reduce their demand for new solutions due to difficult economic conditions or if the uptake of our Market Specific Solutions otherwise declines, then the revenues generated from the sale of products and services would decline and our Customer Retention Rate in our Market Specific Solutions business unit may be affected. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We market and deliver such products pursuant to two distribution and licensing arrangements (the “SolidWorks Distribution Agreements”). The first, entered into by and between our subsidiary Nuovamacut Automazione S.p.A.

In particular, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisitions or joint venture opportunities or complete any particular acquisition, combination, joint venture or other transaction on acceptable terms. Acquisitions pose additional risks, including overpayment in relation to purchase price, incurrence of unexpected costs or the assumption of unexpected liabilities and undisclosed risks, including change of control provisions in the agreements entered by the acquired company. For example, we may learn of additional information about the acquired business that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities or issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations or other matters. If we failed to identify material information regarding such business, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify our business plan, or incur impairment or other charges. In addition, our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions may depend on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. Furthermore, such transactions could be significant or transformational in size and importance for the Group and the consolidation of the results of such businesses may affect the comparability of our financial statements with prior periods. See “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of _operations—Factors affecting the comparability of our results of operations—Bolt-on acquisitions made by the Group.”_ In evaluating potential acquisitions or business combinations, we make certain assumptions regarding the future combined results of the existing and acquired operations, the consolidation of operations and the improved operating cost structures for the combined operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to profitably operate the acquired businesses and that the expected synergies or benefits will be achieved on the assumed time schedule or in the assumed amount, if at all. We cannot predict the timing and success of our efforts to acquire or combine with any particular business and fully integrate the acquired business into our existing organizational set-up or our product offering, commercial channels and operating model, particularly for material or ----- transformational acquisitions of, or combination with, larger businesses or business units, which may prove difficult to integrate into our business, increasing the risk that such acquisitions or combinations may not be successful. Transformational or material acquisitions or business combinations may require significant financial and operating resources and we may not have the necessary experience to successfully undertake such large acquisitions, which may also result in unfavorable external perceptions of the transaction or us, creating the potential for rating downgrades or adversely affecting the market price of the Notes. Further, our efforts to select, acquire and integrate other businesses may divert managerial resources away from our business operations. Moreover, as a result of our recent acquisition of MailUp and Acumbamail, two companies operating in the email services provider sector in Italy and Spain, respectively (see “Summary—Recent developments—Bolt-on _acquisitions”), we intend to expand our operations in the marketing automation sector in Italy and Spain to further_ consolidate our comprehensive offering of cloud-based solutions CRM and E-commerce solutions and enhance cross-selling opportunities within our customer base. We have also recently entered the Turkish sector with the acquisition of the Mikro group to establish our presence in the Turkish corporate commercial software segment. We cannot ensure that we will be able to profitably operate in such new sector and geographic area and to achieve the level of revenue, profitability and growth that we expect. Our expansion into emerging countries, such as Turkey, carries significant uncertainty due to various factors, including economic and political instability. In addition, the integration of an acquired business and its systems, operations and personnel, particularly in respect of businesses operating in new and adjacent segments, could be more difficult and time-consuming than anticipated, including as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions in Italy and abroad, such the recent inflationary surges, high interest rates and other geopolitical reasons. These integrations can be difficult and unpredictable also because of the complexity of software and given the acquired technology is typically developed independently and may not have been designed to integrate with our products. The difficulties are compounded when the products involved are well-established, as compatibility with the existing base of installed products must be preserved, and/or when the size of the acquired business is significant as compared to the size of the acquiror. Successful integration also requires coordination of different teams (e.g., R&D, commercial and marketing teams). This too can be difficult and unpredictable because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions, product roadmaps, commercial and go-to-market approach and, more generally, organizational and operations set-up. Any of these factors could lead to increased operating costs, the loss of key employees, suppliers, agents and customers and a failure to realize anticipated synergies, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, certain of the businesses we have acquired are operated through strategic partnerships with other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in the relevant company and might have interests conflicting with ours.

In addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn out arrangements","We operate a number of our businesses through strategic partnerships with other investors who hold a non-controlling interest in the relevant Group subsidiary. Our relationships with these strategic partners are governed by various contractual arrangements, which regulate, amongst others, the corporate governance, ----- management and administration of such businesses. In certain circumstances, certain material decisions regarding such subsidiaries’ operations, such as capital increases, relocation of corporate domicile and other relevant matters, require the consent of non-controlling shareholders. In selected cases, we have also undertaken to make dividend distributions. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, payments of dividends to non-controlling shareholders of our subsidiaries amounted to approximately €3.4 million. Our strategic partners may not necessarily share our views on the manner in which the relevant business should operate and may exercise their rights in a manner, which is adverse to us, which, in turn, may adversely affect our business. Moreover, if we are unable to resolve such conflicts of interest or disputes with strategic partners in an amicable way, we may be required to initiate legal proceedings, which would require us to incur significant costs, divert management’s attention from day-to-day operations and expose us to substantially uncertain outcomes. As a result, any disputes with our strategic partners could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our agreements with our strategic partners normally provide for put and call option arrangements on the non-controlling interest in the relevant Group subsidiary which give our partners the right to cause us to purchase the non-controlling interest within predetermined periods, as well as for certain earn-out arrangements or other types of deferred consideration based on the performance of such businesses. Our overall liability with respect to such put and call option and earn-out arrangements relating to non-controlling holdings of certain Group companies (the “Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries”) is accounted for as financial debt in our Consolidated Financial Statements and, as of March 31, 2024, amounted to €189.2 million on a discounted basis, or €206.0 million on a non-discounted basis. We currently expect to use approximately €70.0 million of the proceeds of the Offering to buy out stakes held by the non-controlling shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries. Our current contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders allow us to exercise our call option rights in the short-term. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire the relevant equity stakes within the anticipated time frame or at all. The Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries reflect our estimate of discounted future disbursements in connection with such options and earn-out arrangements, based on the applicable contractual provisions. The strike price of the put and call options is determined based on normalized earnings parameters of the relevant companies plus or minus the net financial position for the period in which the put or call option will be exercised. The discount rate applied for the measurement of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries as of any given date is the cost of debt for the Group (gross of the tax effect) that is adopted for the performance of Group impairment tests, as the cost of this debt is considered to be representative of the Group’s credit risk as of such date. The value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries is subject to change over time as the exercise price of each put and call option and earn out arrangement is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the relevant company in a given future period, which could differ from the performance that we estimate when determining the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for accounting purposes. If the value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries change, the change is accounted for in our statement of profit or loss as finance income (if the value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries decreases) or finance expense (if the value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries increases). If we underestimate the value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for any reasons, our financial liabilities would be higher than the ones reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the cash amounts we would be required to pay our strategic partners would be higher than expected. If we are required to make any such payments, our liquidity position would be adversely affected. In addition, we may not have available cash on our balance sheet to acquire the relevant non-controlling interests at the time we are contractually required to do so and we may otherwise be unable to obtain financing at favorable terms and conditions or at all.

Our SME and professional customers often take significant time evaluating our proposals and innovative SaaS-native solutions before licensing our software. The period between the initial engagement and the decision to opt for such software normally varies from customer to customer, may be time-consuming and can last several months. This is particularly true with purchases by larger SME customers of more elaborate software products. During the sales evaluation period, our existing and prospective customers may delay purchases, may decide not to purchase and may scale down proposed orders for reasons that we do not control and cannot predict, including: - changes in economic conditions; - changes in our point of contact at the customers; - reduced demand for our software solutions; - introduction of new products by our competitors; - lower prices offered by our competitors for similar products; - changes in the budgets and purchasing priorities of our customers; - need for education of customer personnel; - changes in the information systems of our customers; and - changes in applicable laws and regulations.

Companies providing (a) payment services are required to be enrolled in the register of payment institutions held by the Bank of Italy pursuant to Article 114-septies of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, and (b) asset management services are required to be enrolled in the register of asset managers held by the Bank of Italy pursuant to Article 35 of the Italian Legislative Decree No. 58 of February 24, 1998. As a result, the TS Regulated Entities are subject to, amongst others, a variety of complex Italian and EU laws and regulations applicable to payment or asset management services. In particular, regulators oversee a number of business areas where the TS Regulated Entities operate, including corporate governance, transparency in the provision of services and propriety in dealings with customers, reporting and registration obligations, money laundering and corruption prevention and data protection, and in order to obtain and maintain licenses to operate as a payment institution and asset management company, respectively, the TS Regulated Entities are required to comply with, among other things: (i) rules governing the segregation of assets relating to the regulated services, (ii) capital adequacy requirements (as further described below), (iii) rules relating to the conduct of business and (iv) anti-money laundering rules and regulations. Payment institutions and asset management companies are required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital. The amount of regulatory capital of payment institutions varies depending on several circumstances in accordance with the provisions set forth under the Bank of Italy “Supervisory provisions for payment institutions and _electronic money institutions” (Order of July 23, 2019, as amended, the “PI Supervisory Provisions”) and, in_ any event, must never be less than the level of the minimum initial capital required for the establishment of the payment institution (i.e. €125 thousand as of the date of this Offering Memorandum for the type of services provided by TeamSystem Payments S.r.l.). In particular, the PI Supervisory Provisions provide that payment institutions (such as TeamSystem Payments S.r.l.) may determine the capital requirement using one of two methods: (i) under the first method, the capital requirement must be at least 10% of such institution’s fixed operating costs for the previous year (this method is generally applicable for the first year only. However, the payment institution may file a reasoned request to the Bank of Italy for the extended application of the same method with respect to the following years of activity; the Bank of Italy may deny such request); and (ii) under the second method (which is the standard method from the second year of activity), the capital requirement must be at least equal to the sum of a certain percentage of the “payment volume” managed by the payment institution (defined as one-twelfth (1/12) of the total amount of payment transactions managed in the preceding year), multiplied by a graduation factor which depends on the type of services provided. Overall, payment institutions must consistently hold a total minimum capital at least equal to the sum of the capital requirement for the payment services provided. The Bank of Italy may require higher or lower requirements and further requirements may apply for payments institutions providing payment services embedding a financing component. Asset management companies are also subject to certain regulatory capital requirements, including those set forth under Bank of Italy Regulation of January 19, 2015, as amended. In particular, the amount of the regulatory capital of asset management companies (i.e. TeamSystem Capital at Work SGR S.p.A.) must at all times be at least equal ----- to 0.02% of the portion of the assets under management exceeding €250 million, up to a maximum of €10 million. Additional specific capital requirements may apply for the coverage of specific risks. In addition to complying with regulatory capital requirements, TeamSystem Payments S.r.l. is also subject to the prudential regime introduced by Directive (EU) No. 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council (“PSD II”). PSD II is a EU directive that aims to improve digital payment services throughout the EU by improving the ease and security of internet payment services, protecting consumers from fraud, abuse and payment problems, promoting innovative mobile and internet payment services, strengthening consumer rights and strengthening the role of the European Banking Authority. PSD II was implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree No. 218 of December 15, 2017, which came into force on January 13, 2018. PSD II facilitates third parties’ direct access to bank accounts and, accordingly, provides opportunities for increased competition among system participants. Compliance with the regulations governing payment institutions or asset managers may be burdensome and costly, particularly in the event of any regulatory changes or developments that may be introduced from time to time at the European or Italian level. If we fail to comply with or if we infringe any applicable rules and regulations, any person holding administrative, management and control functions of the TS Regulated Entities may be subject to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, and/or our authorization to operate as a payments service institution or asset management company, as applicable, may be temporarily or permanently revoked, and we may ultimately suffer reputational damages and lose customers’ confidence as a result. Additionally, liberalization or other changes in the regulatory framework to which we are currently subject may increase the number of competitors we face. International competitors may be subject to less stringent legal and regulatory regimes and may as a result have a competitive advantage over us, both in terms of the services and products they are able to offer as well as the commercial success they may be able to achieve as a result of being subject to less burdensome regulations. Furthermore, the direct or indirect acquisition of equity interests in the capital stock of a payment institution or an asset management company requires prior authorization by the Bank of Italy to the extent following such acquisition the relevant acquiror, acting individually or in concert: (i) holds a stake equal to or greater than 10% of the share capital or the voting rights of the company; (ii) further increases its stake up to or above 20%, 30% or 50% of the share capital or the voting rights of the company, or (ii) is able to exercise a significant influence over the management of the company or otherwise acquires the control of the company regardless of its stake. Pursuant to these rules, in order to maintain our licenses to operate as a payment institution and an asset management company, respectively, in 2021 we were required to obtain the clearance from the Bank of Italy with respect to the change of indirect ownership of the TS Regulated Entities. Such rules are still applicable and, for example, any enforcement of the security interest in the Issuer’s share capital or any other event triggering the transfer of the voting rights attached to any such pledged share capital to a third party, including the pledgee(s), as the case may be, would require clearance by the Bank of Italy in light of the fact that the TS Regulated Entities are subject to the supervision of such authority. For further information, see “—Risks related to the Notes, the _Guarantees and the Collateral—The recovery from the enforcement of the share pledges forming part of the Collateral may be complicated, involve long recovery times and a low recovery rate and may require prior approval by certain regulatory bodies, including, in certain circumstances, the Bank of Italy.”_ In addition, in 2021, we acquired a controlling interest in Modefinance S.r.l. (“Modefinance”), an Italian fintech rating agency specialized in the assessment of the credit rating of financial and non-financial institutions and the development of AI solutions for the analysis and management of credit risk. Modefinance also distributes its products internationally through its wholly-owned subsidiary Modefinance International S.r.l. Modefinance issues both solicited and unsolicited credit ratings.

Although we have implemented an internal financial control framework which is defined, monitored and tested regularly, and anti-fraud processes are in place, we cannot ensure that no breaches of this framework will occur either through fraudulent procedures or acts of collusion. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could harm our business. This risk is increased as a result of our frequent acquisitions. Certain entities that we acquired in the past did not have internal control procedures in certain respects (including authorization over financial matters, accounting entries, expense claims, conflict of interest management and human resource management) to the same standard as our procedures. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, our financial statements may not accurately reflect our financial condition, which could result in a failure to discharge reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In order to manage growth effectively, we must continue to monitor and maintain our internal financial control framework and correct any identified deficiencies in respect thereto. We cannot ensure that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal financial control framework in the future.

As of March 31, 2024, we had a total of 4,820 employees. The Italian constitution provides that all employees of Italian companies have the right to set up and join trade unions and to carry on trade union activities, including appointing workers’ representatives to negotiate with their employer. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 4% of TeamSystem’s employees belonged to trade unions. The right to go on strike is provided for under Italian law and there can be no assurance that there will not be any strikes in the future, such as in connection with our recent and future reorganization efforts. Any work stoppages resulting from employee strikes could hinder our ability to provide our standard level of customer service. In addition, we have been in the past and could in the future be party to, labor disputes with certain of our employees, including in connection with termination of their employment relations with us. There can be no assurance that these disputes or future disputes by employees will not have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, from time to time, we have and may in the future, carry out collective dismissals. Such collective dismissals may result in disputes with or claims by trade unions and our employees and we may be required to pay additional amounts to resolve or settle such disputes or claims. Any disputes with our employees or work stoppages resulting from strikes or other labor action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. All workers performing their activity in Italy are covered by mandatory social security insurance. This system is financed by contributions from employees and employers, calculated as a percentage of the employee’s gross remuneration. These contributions represent a relatively high surcharge on labor costs. Also, in Italy, national insurance contributions to INAIL (the ----- National Institute for Accidents at Work), which covers all professional risks, are mandatory. In addition to these social security measures, employers must set aside in their financial statements (or pay into supplementary pension funds) a mandatory severance payment (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto or TFR), which is deferred remuneration equal to 1/13.5 of any remuneration paid to the employees in connection with the employment relationship. As of March 31, 2024, our provision for pension and similar obligation was €1.7 million.

For example, over the past few years, we have made certain changes to our organizational structure in order to improve the effectiveness of our sales organizations. In particular, in the last few years we initiated an overall insourcing of our VARs that led to significant reduction in recourse to external VARs by either acquiring the relevant business units or individual VARs to create a direct link between us and our VARs’ customer bases. See “Business—Our _Sales Channels—Field Sales Channel.”_ While we maintain a largely positive relationship with both our internalized and external VARs and expect to capitalize on our expertise and the direct engagement with our broader customer base, we cannot guarantee that our current or future initiatives aimed at enhancing the efficiency of our sales channels will be free from cultural integration difficulties, disruption to our growth strategy, or a decrease in our sales force’s productivity, each of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, cultural integration challenges could increase the turnover within our sales force and cause disruption in sales cycles, including delay or loss of business. In addition, it typically takes time to implement new sales management plans and to effectively recruit and train new sales personnel. See “—Our future success depends on _our ability to continue to retain and attract highly skilled employees. The loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations.”_ Moreover, in recent years, we launched a comprehensive cost optimization program called “Project Delorean” based on six major pillars in order to improve our efficiency across our operations. These initiatives are related to several areas of our organization, including sales and marketing, R&D, general and administrative and human resources. Although the aim of our reorganization efforts is to obtain organizational synergies and improve the way we run our business and interact with customers, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement any or all of these initiatives and the costs we incur in trying to realize the associated cost savings may be substantially higher than our current estimates. For further information on these cost saving initiatives, see “Summary—Summary historical financial information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data” and “—We have presented certain adjusted and pro forma financial information in this Offering Memorandum that is _based upon management estimates including in respect of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for certain cost saving initiatives, annualized recurring revenues, Adjusted EBITDA generated from bolt-on acquisitions.

While we maintain insurance in amounts we believe to be appropriate against risks commonly insured against in the industry, there can be no guarantee that all such risks are covered by insurance or that we will be able to obtain the levels of cover desired by us on acceptable terms in the future.

As of March 31, 2024, our goodwill was €2,172.7 million, representing 52.9% of our total assets as of such date. Our goodwill is tested annually (or more frequently if specific events or changes in circumstance indicate the possibility that value has been impaired) for impairment, and our goodwill is not subject to amortization. With respect to intangible assets that are not amortized, an impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the current carrying amount are based are not fulfilled and the recoverable amount of any cash generating unit is less than the Group’s carrying amount. When calculating value-in-use, the board of directors estimates the cash flows expected from a cash generating unit or a group of cash generating units and determines the applicable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The impairment test is performed using forecasts of cash flow included in the business plan approved by our board of directors at the relevant date. We recorded goodwill impairments and may be required to record additional goodwill impairments in the future in the event that business forecasts are cut significantly. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an impairment loss of non-current assets of €78.1 million in connection with the purchase price allocation to our Digital Finance business unit. Impairments may also result from, among other factors, (i) deterioration in performance, (ii) adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our business activities or affect the products and services we sell and (iii) negative changes in applicable discount rate, due to adverse changes in interest rates.

However, beginning in 2020, we commenced an internationalization program consisting of organic growth, investments and acquisitions, including in Spain and, in 2023, of a majority stake in the Mikro group in Turkey. There can be no assurance that any of these acquisitions and future investments will prove successful. Entering international markets, including other European markets or emerging markets, requires substantial amounts of management time and attention, either through acquisitions, joint ventures or other forms of association. The economies of some of these countries differ from the Italian economy or the economies of Western Europe and in some cases present a greater risk profile due to, among others, the level of political instability, government involvement, development, growth rate and control of foreign exchange. For these and other reasons, our solutions may not be accepted in other markets to the extent which would be necessary to make our international expansion profitable. Moreover, the additional demands on management from these activities may detract from our efforts in Italy and adversely affect our operating results. Any international expansion exposes us to the risks normally associated with conducting international business operations, including multiple national and regulatory compliance requirements, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, changes in foreign legislation, labor laws, data protection laws, intellectual property laws, anti-corruption laws, anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws, possible foreign currency controls, currency exchange rate fluctuations or devaluations, tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, difficulties in obtaining and managing information suppliers, potential negative tax consequences, difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and inability to enforce any remedies that would be otherwise available. In addition, we may face additional risks, including, training costs, the lack of expertise and the loss of key employees in such markets, differences in business cultures and practices, the lack of adequate and available management teams to monitor and integrate these operations, unfavorable commercial terms and difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, control procedures and policies. Moreover, joint ventures or associations may involve additional risks related to disagreements regarding strategy, the need to provide further investments, general lack of control over the direction of the joint venture or association and/or reputational risks with respect to the quality of services rendered by the partners. Any negative impact caused by the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As we report in Euro, we are subject to risks relating to the conversion into euros of the statements of financial position and profit or loss statements of our subsidiaries located in a country that does not use the Euro.

In December 2022, the member states of the EU unanimously voted to adopt the OECD’s minimum tax rules and phase them into law, and in February 2023 the OECD released technical guidance on the global minimum tax which was agreed by consensus of the Pillar Two signatory jurisdictions.

There is a risk that such partners may not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to anti-corruption, and may be involved in illegitimate activities in local markets that are unknown to us. If we fail to adequately supervise them or maintain an adequate compliance program, we may be liable for their actions. An allegation or a finding of illicit conduct by us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations as well as our ability to win new orders or renew existing commercial relationships.

If we are found liable for violations of any of these laws (either due to our own actions, out of our own non-adherence or due to actions or nonadherence of others), we could suffer administrative, criminal or civil liabilities. Furthermore, violations of such laws could result in fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, termination of existing contracts, revocations or restrictions of licenses.

Effective internal controls are also necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent and detect fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud with regards to these reports, our financial results could be negatively affected. Additionally, at the operational level, individual employees may not comply with our policies and guidelines and as a result may cause us to incur compliance costs and cause us reputational damage. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors and other third parties to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. Compliance with existing requirements is expensive and further requirements may increase our costs and require additional management time and resources. We may need to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy our reporting requirements.

We have prepared this information as a means to estimate what our Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 may have been when adjusting for such effects as described herein. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 is based upon management estimates and a series of assumptions, conditions and qualifications. These assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those estimated. For example, with respect to certain bolt-on acquisitions (including those which we completed after March 31, 2024), the adjustments are based upon certain preliminary financial information, including budgeted data for the year ended December 31, 2023 or 2024, that was made available to us in connection with such acquisition, together with our management’s assumptions and estimates. In addition, the EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA of such and the other acquired businesses which forms part of our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was calculated on the basis of the applicable accounting standards of the various businesses acquired, which may differ from our applicable accounting standards. As a result, the adjustment relating to our bolt-on acquisition may be different if we had tried to reconcile all of such EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA data to IFRS. In addition, the costs we will incur in trying to implement the cost saving and other initiatives and other benefits described herein which form part of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA may be substantially higher than our current estimates and may outweigh any benefit or the realization of any such measure could take longer to realize than currently expected or could fail to realize, including as a result of factors that are beyond our control. The estimates and assumptions underlying the calculation of our Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma_ Adjusted EBITDA involve factors that are beyond our control, may relate to future events and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. These factors include, in particular: - claims and litigation that might be initiated by our workforce or the unions to which our workforce belongs, in connection with our personnel rationalization initiatives; - our ability to integrate the acquired businesses, including within the expected timeline or at all; - our ability to consummate the bolt-on acquisitions for which we have entered into an acquisition agreement; - our ability to successfully re-negotiate our contracts with third party service providers (e.g., utilities); - whether our assumptions regarding any annualized revenues are reasonable for purposes of preparing our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA; and - other risk factors identified in this Offering Memorandum. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions we have used to calculate our Adjusted EBITDA and Pro _Forma Adjusted EBITDA are reasonable and are based either on our historical experience or our knowledge of_ the marketplace, if one or more of these assumptions is inaccurate, we may be unable to achieve these estimates, which may render the estimates, and any of the management assumptions, partly or completely inaccurate.

In addition, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants while the Revolving Credit Facility remains outstanding. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement requires us to comply with a financial ratio while amounts exceeding a certain threshold remain outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements— _Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Our ability to meet the financial ratio under the Revolving Credit Facility_ may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet such financial ratio. While failure to satisfy the financial ratio shall not directly or indirectly constitute, or result in a default or event of default, it would result in a draw stop for any new utilizations under the Revolving Credit Facility thereby potentially adversely impacting our liquidity. Subject to the foregoing, a breach of any of the covenants or restrictions under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement could, subject to the applicable cure period, result in an event of default under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is continuing under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the relevant creditors will be entitled to cancel the availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and/or elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, immediately due and payable. In addition, a default, event of default and/or acceleration action under the Revolving Credit Facility could lead to an event of default and acceleration under other debt instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions, including (in the case of acceleration of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility) the Indenture and the Existing Indenture. If our creditors, including the creditors under the Revolving Credit Facility or the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, accelerate the payment of those amounts, we cannot assure you that our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all other liabilities of our subsidiaries that would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Notes. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed against any Collateral granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, that currently anticipated growth, cost savings or efficiencies will be realized or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs including the repayment at maturity of the then outstanding amount under the Revolving Credit Facility or redemption of the Existing Senior Secured Notes at their maturity. At the maturity of each of the Revolving Credit Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Notes or any other debt that we may incur, we may be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness if we do not have sufficient cash flows from operations and other capital resources to pay our debt obligations as they fall due, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See also “—We may be unable to raise the financing that we require or refinance _our existing debt, including the Existing Senior Secured Notes_ _that are not refinanced as part of the Transactions and Revolving Credit Facility, each of which will mature prior to the Notes.”_ ----- If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. The type, timing and terms of any future financing, restructuring, asset sales or other capital raising transactions will depend on our cash needs and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets. We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets to repay any portion or all of our debt. Any failure to make payments on the Notes or the Existing Senior Secured Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the Notes, the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility, will limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurances that any assets that we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale would be acceptable. If we are unsuccessful in any of these efforts, we may not have sufficient cash to meet our obligations, which could cause an event of default under our debt and result in: - our debt holders, including holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, declaring all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; - the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility Agreement being able to terminate their commitments to lend us money and foreclose against the assets securing our borrowings; and - our being forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, which could result in you losing your investment in the Notes. In addition, we intend to use the Revolving Credit Facility and the expected increased of the commitments thereto, as contemplated by the Transactions, for liquidity and working capital purposes, and if we are unable to refinance the Revolving Credit Facility in the future when needed or when it would be most beneficial to do so or if we are unable to procure a replacement liquidity line for working capital and capital expenditure purposes, our financial condition may be adversely affected and our ability to implement our business strategy may be impaired. Additionally, borrowings under other debt agreements or instruments that contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all of our debts, including the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,Risks related to our structure and the Transactions,13.6.6,"The Existing Floating Rate Notes, the Notes, drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility and any future variable interest rate debt we incur in the future bear or will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow, or could otherwise be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes","After giving effect to the Refinancing and the Revolving Credit Facility Amendment, a large portion of our debt, including the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the Notes and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility (if any), will bear interest at a variable rate, and we are therefore exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. The Notes, the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility bear or may bear a variable rate of interest based on the EURIBOR, term SOFR or SONIA (as applicable), plus an applicable margin. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available for capital expenditures and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. The Existing Indenture and the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement do not, and the Indenture will not, contain a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. We may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates. For example, to hedge against the fluctuation of the EURIBOR with respect to the Existing Floating Rate Notes, in 2022, we entered into certain interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which we are fixed rate payer and we receive the ----- required floating rate amounts from our bank counterparties. Following the issuance of the Notes, we may consider further hedging against interest rate fluctuations to maintain our interest rate risk management strategy, also depending on the evolution of interest rates and forecasts. While we may continue to enter and maintain hedging arrangements to fix rates on our indebtedness, there can be no assurance that hedging will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at a commercially reasonable price. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements, that hedges might not be available for the full amount or term of the borrowings, that break clauses might be required or that hedges will limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in interest rates. To the extent interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. Following the LIBOR manipulation scandal, it was widely considered that reforms were required to regulate the production of indices to attempt to prevent such activities occurring in the future and to provide regulators with appropriate supervisory tools. In order to help achieve this aim the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks were introduced in July 2013, operating on a global voluntary compliance basis to all benchmark administrators, and the EU Benchmark Regulation (regulation (EU) 2016/1011) was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 29, 2016, and with some provisions applying immediately after the majority applying from January 1, 2018, subject to transitional provisions, particularly in relation to third party country benchmarks. The EU Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark, within the EU. It, among other things (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed subject to transitional provisions which still apply) and (ii) prevents in scope use of benchmarks by EU supervised entities where the benchmark administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU based, where regulatory regimes have not deemed equivalent or benchmarks have not been recognized or endorsed). Further, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) announced that it intended to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. Subsequently, on March 5, 2021, the FCA announced the dates on which panel bank submissions for all LIBOR settings will cease. As at the date of this Offering Memorandum, only the synthetic 1-month, 3-month and 6-month US dollar LIBOR settings remain, and these settings are expected to cease permanently on September 30, 2024. It is possible that benchmarks such as EURIBOR may be discontinued in future if they cease to comply with the requirements of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, or if the administrator of the relevant benchmark either fails to apply for authorization or is refused authorization by its home regulator. On July 2, 2019, the European Money Markets Institute, administrator for EURIBOR, was granted authorization under the EU Benchmark Regulation by the Financial Services and Markets Authority of Belgium. Consequently, EURIBOR is at this point considered compliant with the EU Benchmark Regulation. It should be noted however that this does not mean that EURIBOR will remain a representative measure if markets evolve and the Working Group on Euro Risk-Free Rates has cautioned in a factsheet on EURIBOR fallbacks published in March 2020 that benchmarks are subject to the risk of disruption or future discontinuation. The potential elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR is determined or could result in its discontinuation, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark (including but not limited to the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes). In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR may result in our floating rate debt (including but not limited to the Existing Floating Rate Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes) performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR had not developed. The Existing Indenture provides, and the Indenture will provide, that, in the event that EURIBOR is no longer being calculated or administered or is otherwise no longer generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities under the Existing Indenture and the Indenture, the alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Existing Floating Rate Notes is, and with respect to the Notes will be, any successor rate generally accepted in the euro-zone for the purposes of determining floating rates of interest in respect of euro-denominated securities, as identified by the Issuer in good faith. However, in the event that there is no generally accepted successor rate to EURIBOR in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, the Issuer, in consultation with the Calculation Agent, will determine a reasonably appropriate alternative basis for determining the rate of interest on the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the Notes (and any such alternative basis adopted will in all cases never be less than 0%). This means that interest on the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the Notes would be determined by the Issuer (without the involvement of an independent financial institution) on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not ----- contemplated at the time you purchased the Existing Floating Rate Notes and the Notes. See “Description of _Notes—Terms of the Notes.” The Existing Indenture and the Indenture may require the exercise of discretion by_ the Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Existing Indenture or the Indenture) without the consent of the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Notes, as applicable. The interests of the Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. If we determine that EURIBOR has been permanently discontinued or, at the request of the Issuer or the agent under the Revolving Facility Agreement (acting on the instructions of the majority lenders), the agent will use an alternative reference rate in the manner as described in the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. On October 23, 2020, ISDA published (1) a supplement to the 2006 ISDA Definitions (the “IBOR Fallbacks",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Under any such agreements, we would be exposed to the credit risks of our counterparties. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, claims we have under the swap agreements or other hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The IBOR Fallbacks Supplement amends the 2006 ISDA Definitions (the “2006 Definitions”) with respect to various interbank offered rates (“IBORs”) (such as EURIBOR or LIBOR) so that new derivatives transactions that incorporate the 2006 Definitions will “fall back” to alternative reference rates upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including a permanent cessation of the relevant IBOR. The IBOR Fallbacks Protocol will enable adhering parties to implement these fallbacks into the terms of legacy transactions that incorporate the 2006 Definitions. ISDA published the first draft of the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions (the “2021 Definitions”) in June 2021 and, therefore, many derivative transactions will incorporate the 2021 Definitions instead of the 2006 Definitions. The 2021 Definitions incorporate the approach taken under the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement with respect to certain specific benchmarks, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, and adopt the same approach as under the ISDA Benchmarks Supplement with respect to the remaining benchmarks, although the 2021 Definitions will be further updated over time. In the event that EURIBOR is permanently discontinued, this may, therefore, result in a mismatch between the fallback benchmark that applies under any EURIBOR hedging arrangements and the fallback benchmark that applies under the Notes and the Revolving Facility Agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In addition, the obligations of any Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider (other than the Parent Guarantor) that becomes a Guarantor and/or a security provider will be subject to the Agreed Security Principles and will be subject to the additional limitations set forth in the relevant supplemental indenture to the Indenture and/or in the applicable security documents, in order for the applicable Italian Guarantor and/or Italian security provider to comply with the above corporate law requirements on, among others, corporate benefit and financial assistance.

In addition to the above, under Article 1938 of the Italian Civil Code, if a corporate guarantee is issued by a Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Italy to guarantee conditional or future obligations, the guarantee must be limited to a maximum amount. Such maximum amount should be expressly identified at the outset and expressed in figures (either in the guarantee deed or by reference to a separate document, such as the Indenture). It has been held that such determination must be proportionate to the relevant Guarantor’s assets. If such ----- determination is deemed disproportionate to the assets of each of the Guarantors, there is a risk that the guarantee could be declared void. The only entity that is currently expected to guarantee the Notes is the Parent Guarantor (i.e. TeamSystem Holdco 3 S.p.A.), which is also the issuer of the Existing PIK Notes and, upon refinancing thereof with the proceeds from the PIK Notes, will be the issuer of the PIK Notes.

As a result, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover amounts from an enforcement of the Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor will be further limited by the fact that the right of the holders of the Notes to receive amounts from such enforcement will rank pari passu with the right of the holders of the PIK Notes to receive payments under the PIK Notes, as well as the right of the holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility to receive payments under the guarantee of each such instrument by the Parent Guarantor.

See “Description of Notes—Security.” Trade receivables, inventories, intellectual property rights, real property and certain other assets of the Issuer and the restricted subsidiaries will not constitute part of the Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with the offering of the Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges and the amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, regulatory restrictions that could affect such sale, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale and the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers. The shares and other Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Notes, in part because most of the Collateral may not be liquid and its value to other parties may be less than its value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. In the event of foreclosure, the transfer of our business operations may be prohibited or only permitted to a limited group of investors eligible to hold such assets, thereby decreasing the pool of potential buyers. Furthermore, entry into the Security Documents, ----- enforcement of the Collateral and any direct or indirect transfer of our operations may require, in certain jurisdictions (including Italy), governmental or other regulatory consents, approvals or filings, or might otherwise be challenged. Such consents, approvals or filings may take time to obtain or may not be obtained at all. As a result, enforcement may be delayed, a temporary shutdown of operations may occur and the value of the Collateral may be significantly decreased. Most of our assets will not secure the Notes and it is possible that the value of the Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of the Collateral may decline over time.

At each time, if the security interest granted, recreated, perfected, confirmed and/or confirmed and extended, were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening or voidance period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void, ineffective, clawed back and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Under Italian law, in case any security interests (including security interests in the Collateral) is released and retaken at any time, such release and retaking of security interests may give rise to the start of a new hardening period in respect of such security interests. Under certain circumstances, other creditors, bankruptcy trustees, insolvency administrators or courts could challenge the validity and enforceability of the grant of such security interests. See “Limitations on validity _and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations.”_ The Indenture will provide that the Collateral securing the Notes may be released and retaken in several circumstances, including in connection with a public offering of shares of common stock or other common equity interest and certain internal “permitted reorganizations.” See “Description of Notes—Security—Release of Liens.” ----- In Italy, for example, such a release and retaking of Collateral may give rise to new hardening periods in respect of the relevant security interests in the Collateral that are granted, perfected or released and retaken, and the security interests in the relevant Collateral would be subject to the same risks described in the preceding paragraph.

As the Notes will be issued by the Issuer, an enforcement over the shares of the Issuer would involve the enforcement over the share pledge of an entity with outstanding debt claims. In addition, the Existing Indenture does not, and the Indenture will not, prohibit the Issuer from incurring additional debt claims in the future. Consequently, the enforcement of the share pledge over the Issuer’s shares may result in the release of the Issuer’s debt obligations, which could result in a taxable capital gain. This taxable capital gain is likely to reduce the proceeds of any recovery from the enforcement of such share pledge. Therefore, the value of the pledge over the shares of the Issuer may be limited. To the extent the enforcement of this security interest resulted in an acquisition of a holding in the Issuer, any such enforcement would require clearance by the Italian Golden Power Authority, pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation. In addition, any enforcement of the security interest in the Issuer’s share capital or any other event triggering the transfer of the voting rights attached to any such pledged share capital to a third party, including the pledgee(s), as the case may be, would require clearance by the Bank of Italy in light of the fact that the TS Regulated Entities are subject to the supervision of such authority.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, on June 25, 2024, we have submitted an application with the Italian Golden Power Authority pursuant to the Italian Golden Power Legislation in order for the Collateral to be granted. See “Risks related to our business— _The Italian Golden Power Legislation is applicable to the Issuer and the Group.”_ Unless the Italian Golden Power Authority prohibits the granting of the security over the Collateral or imposes conditions, recommendations, restrictions or undertakings which are deemed excessively burdensome by the Issuer (in its sole discretion, acting reasonably and in good faith), the Notes will be secured by the Collateral, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within 30 Business Days from and excluding the later of (i) the Issue Date and (ii) the Italian Golden Power Clearance Date. Obtaining ----- the Italian Golden Power Clearance pursuant to the Golden Power Legislation is subject to inherent uncertainties and there is no assurance that it will be obtained. If the Italian Golden Power Clearance is not granted, the Notes will be unsecured and, as a result, the holders of the Notes will have only an unsecured claim against our assets and the Notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness of the Issuer, including the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Private Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, and of the PIK Issuer to the extent such debt is secured over the Shared Collateral (including the Existing PIK Notes), in each case, until redemption or repayment thereof, as applicable. Any such unsecured claim will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness and other obligations, including trade payables. Moreover, our inability to grant the Collateral due to the Italian Golden Power Clearance not being granted will not result in an “event of default” under the Indenture, and will not require the Issuer or any other party to redeem or repurchase the Notes. In addition, any future enforcement of the Collateral (including, without limitation, the exercise of voting rights by the secured creditors) will require a new clearance under the Italian Golden Power Legislation and there can be no assurance that such clearance will be granted. On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement and we expect that the Notes will constitute “Future Pari Passu Debt” (that are not subordinated in right of payment to any Senior Secured Liabilities) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. However, until the Italian Golden Power Clearance is obtained (or if it is not obtained), the Notes will be (and would remain) unsecured and the Security Agent would not be able to directly recover proceeds from the Collateral for obligations with respect to the Notes (the secured amount remaining limited to the aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the original Revolving Credit Facility), and the recoveries from any security enforcement in respect of the Collateral will therefore be limited. However, we expect the Notes (even if unsecured) will benefit from certain turnover and equalization provisions applicable to “Future Pari Passu Debt” and other classes of liabilities subject to the Intercreditor Agreement. Accordingly, in the event that the Italian Golden Power Clearance is not granted and the Notes remain unsecured claims, we expect the Intercreditor Agreement may be relied upon to provide recoveries to holders of the Notes in respect of enforcement of the Collateral on a pro rata basis pari passu with Senior Secured Liabilities, although given the limitations on the secured amount referred to above, any such recoveries from the Collateral would be insufficient to satisfy the claims of the holders of the Notes in respect of the entire aggregate principal amount thereof. This is however without prejudice to the rights of the holders of the Notes to claim as unsecured creditors for any unpaid claims following enforcement. However, there can be no assurance that this interpretation of the Intercreditor Agreement will not be subject to challenge and, if litigated in English court, there can be no assurance of the outcome of any such proceeding. If such interpretation of the Intercreditor Agreement is successfully challenged, the Intercreditor Agreement could not be relied upon to provide recoveries to holders of the Notes in respect of an enforcement of the Collateral on a pro rata basis pari passu with the Senior Secured Liabilities.

As set forth in “Description of Notes—Meeting of Holders of Notes,” the majority required to pass an extraordinary resolution at any meeting of holders of Notes will be one or more persons holding or representing at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be. These provisions permit defined majorities (50% or 75%), depending on the nature of the resolution, to bind all holders of the Notes or the relevant series of Notes, as the case may be, including holders of Notes who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting, and holders of Notes who voted in a manner contrary to the relevant majority. In particular, under the Indenture, an extraordinary resolution may include, among other things, proposals to reduce the rate or change the time for payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes, to change the date on which any Note may be subject to redemption or reduce the redemption price, to change the currency of payments under the Notes and/or to change the quorum requirements relating to meetings and/or to change the majority required to pass a resolution, and to change the amendment provisions.

Furthermore, the interaction between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is also largely untested in the Italian courts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

All or part of the pledges and other security interests in such jurisdictions will be granted to the Security Agent as security interests for the Parallel Debt and will not directly secure the Principal Obligations. Under parallel debt structures, the Parallel Debt will typically be at all times in the same amount and payable at the same time as the Principal Obligations and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations shall discharge the corresponding Parallel Debt and any payment in respect of the Parallel Debt shall discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. In respect of the security interests granted to secure the Parallel Debt, the holders of the Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement actions in respect of such security interests except through the Security Agent. Therefore, the holders of the Notes will bear the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. In addition, the Parallel Debt construct in financing transactions, including credit facilities and bond issuances, has not been tested under law in certain of these jurisdictions, including under Italian law, and to the extent that the security interests in the Collateral created to secure the Parallel Debt construct are not validly granted, are unenforceable or are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of such security interests in the Collateral. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and _the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations.”_ For example, in Italy the Collateral will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be created and perfected in favor of the Security Agent, acting also in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holder of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code. Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of an agent (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantee by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. Furthermore, under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the Security Documents entered into to secure the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of the Issuer under the rules of avoidance or claw back of Italian insolvency laws and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”). A longer period may apply to any Collateral governed by Italian law which may be granted after the Offering. Moreover, under Italian law, claims of certain categories of creditors (creditori privilegiati) are given statutory priority in relation to the proceeds of a debtor’s property in respect of the claims of other creditors, even if such claims are secured claims. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral _and certain insolvency law considerations.”_ The enforcement of any Collateral located in Italy or governed by Italian law is subject to mandatory provisions of Italian law, including in relation to limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. The laws of certain jurisdictions, including Italy, may not formally recognize the relative ranking of security interests or a second ranking security as a “in rem” right (save for certain limited exceptions). Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, the Shared Collateral will secure on a contractual second-priority basis by operation of the Intercreditor Agreement the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, following their issuance, subject to the obtainment of the Italian Golden Power Clearance, the PIK Notes and the relative ranking of the liens securing the Notes and the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, upon their issuance, the PIK Notes will ----- be established pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. As a consequence, among other things, the relevant Security Documents will secure the Shared Collateral on the same basis for the benefit of, among others, the holders of the Notes and the holders of the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, following their issuance, the PIK Notes, whilst the Intercreditor Agreement, on a contractual basis, provides for the second-priority treatment of the security over the Shared Collateral granted for the benefit of the holders of the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, following their issuance, the PIK Notes. Therefore, holders of the Notes will have to rely on the Intercreditor Agreement to ensure that any security interests that are intended to rank junior to the Notes (including security interests over the Shared Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Existing PIK Notes until their redemption and, following their issuance, the PIK Notes) do, in fact, receive the proceeds of the enforcement of any Collateral after the holders of the Notes.

A further deduction of interest expense in excess of this amount is allowed up to a threshold of 30% of EBITDA (i.e., risultato operativo lordo _della gestione caratteristica or “ROL”), as well as 30% of ROL carried forward from previous fiscal years. The_ ROL is calculated on the basis of the value of the items of the Issuer’s profit and loss account, which are comprised of the operating gross revenues and expenses (excluding depreciation of tangible and intangible assets, as well as leasing fees), as determined through the application of the tax rules concerning the determination of the corporate income taxable base. The amount of ROL not used for the deduction of the amount of interest expense in a fiscal year can be carried forward for the following five fiscal years. The amount of any interest income exceeding the interest expenses in a fiscal year can be carried forward without time limits. Interest expense not deducted in a relevant fiscal year can be carried forward to the following fiscal years and deducted, provided that and to the extent that, in such fiscal years, the amount of interest expense that exceeds interest income (also carried forward from previous fiscal years) is lower than 30% of ROL.

In addition, Italian insolvency laws and regulations have recently been replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code introduced by virtue of, among others, Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 of October 19, 2017 (as subsequently amended and supplemented, the “Italian Insolvency Code”, also known as the Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency), being a comprehensive and in material respects innovative legal framework regulating, among others, insolvency matters. Other than for minor changes in certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, the Italian Insolvency Code came into force starting from July 15, 2022. The previous Italian Bankruptcy Law continues to apply only to filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and filings seeking the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato _preventivo), in each case filed or pending before July 15, 2022.

Considering the sweeping nature of this reform and the absence of judicial guidance, the impact cannot be predicted or fully assessed as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. For a description of Italian insolvency laws and regulations, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations”._ In particular, the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement could be limited in scope and effect by Italian courts to the extent their covenants and provisions, which are largely untested under Italian case law, could be considered to conflict with mandatory provisions of Italian law. In the event that the Issuer experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings or their duration (which may be significantly longer than the duration of analogous proceedings in jurisdictions you may be familiar with). As a consequence, enforcement of rights under the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral in an insolvency situation may be delayed and be complex and costly for creditors. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability _of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations.”_ Although laws differ across jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance and equitable principles, insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in courts in such ----- jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes against the Issuer, the enforceability of a Guarantee against a Guarantor, the enforceability of any other guarantee of the Notes and the enforceability of the security interests in the Collateral. In certain circumstances the court may also void the security interest or the Guarantee if the company is close to or near insolvency. The following discussion of fraudulent transfer, conveyance and insolvency law, although an overview, describes generally applicable terms and principles, which are defined under the relevant jurisdiction’s fraudulent transfer and insolvency statutes. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of a Guarantor or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantee and the security interests, and intercompany obligations generally, as preferences, transaction at an undervalue, invalid charges, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: - avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee or the security interests provided by such security provider; - direct that the Issuer and the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee or any security interest on the Collateral to the relevant Guarantor or security provider or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s or security provider’s creditors; and - take other action that is detrimental to you. If we cannot satisfy our obligations under the Notes and any Guarantee or security interests are found to be a preferences, transactions at an undervalue, fraudulent transfers or conveyances or if otherwise set aside, we cannot assure you that we can ever repay in full any amounts outstanding under the Notes. In addition, the liability of each Guarantor or security provider under its Guarantee or the security interests will be limited to the amount that will result in such guarantee or security interests not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. The amount recoverable from the Guarantor and security providers under the Security Documents will also be limited. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each. There is also the possibility that the entire Guarantee or security interest may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. See also “—The Guarantees and the Collateral _will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantees and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and Enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.”_ In order to initiate any of these actions under fraudulent transfer or other applicable principles, courts would, for example, need to find that, at the time the Guarantees were issued or the security interests created, the Guarantors or security provider: - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding current or future creditors or with a desire to prefer some creditors over others (and, in certain jurisdiction, even if the recipient was aware that the Guarantor of the collateral provider was insolvent when it granted the Guarantees or security interest), or created such security after its insolvency; - issued such Guarantee or created such security interest in a situation where a prudent business person as a shareholder of such Guarantor or security provider would have contributed equity to such Guarantor or security provider or where the relevant beneficiary of the Guarantee or security interest knew or should have known that the Guarantor or security provider was insolvent or a filing for insolvency had been made; - received less than reasonably equivalent value for incurring the debt represented by the Guarantee or security interest on the basis that the Guarantee or security interest were incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly the Guarantor’s or security provider’s benefit, or on some other basis and (i) was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Guarantee or the creation of the security interest, or subsequently became insolvent for other reasons, (ii) was engaged, or was about to engage, in a business transaction for which the Guarantor’s or security provider’s assets were unreasonably small or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to make required payments as and when they would become due; ----- - the Guarantee or security interest was entered into within a certain time period prior to the opening date of insolvency proceedings of the Guarantor or collateral provider; or - the amount paid or payable was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. Different jurisdictions evaluate insolvency on various criteria, but a Guarantor or security provider generally may, in different jurisdictions, be considered insolvent at the time it issued a Guarantee or created any security interest if: - its liabilities exceed the fair market value of its assets; - it cannot pay its debts as and when they become due; or - the present saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay its total existing debts and liabilities, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they mature or become absolute. Although we believe that we are solvent, and will be so after giving effect to the Transactions, there can be no assurance as to which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or security provider was “insolvent” as of the date the Guarantee were issued or the security interests were created or that, regardless of the method of valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or security provider was insolvent on the date its Guarantee was issued or the security interests were created, that payments to holders of the Notes constituted fraudulent transfers on other grounds. Under Italian law, in the event that the Issuer or the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the guarantee and/or the security interests granted to guarantee or secure (as applicable) the Notes could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors or by operation of law under the rules of avoidance or claw back (revocatoria) of Italian Bankruptcy Law (to the extent applicable), the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw back of transactions made by the debtor during a certain legally specified period (the “suspect period”) See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain _insolvency law considerations” for further information._ If challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with the security interest in the Collateral may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, the holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the guarantee or the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. For an overview of certain insolvency laws and enforceability issues as they relate to the Guarantee and security interests, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the Collateral and certain _insolvency law considerations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Our actual amount of cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets on the Issue Date may differ from the amount indicated in the table above due to a variety of factors. In particular, such figure in the table above does not include the amount of cash generated and/or utilized between March 31, 2024 and the Issue Date, including the actual or expected payment of the purchase price in respect of the bolt-on acquisitions that we closed following March 31, 2024 or that we signed and expect to close after the date of this Offering Memorandum, as well as certain minor payments we made after March 31, 2024 in respect of bolt-on acquisitions we closed prior to March 31, 2024. Moreover, the as adjusted cash, cash equivalents and other financial assets figure has not been adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, premia, and additional amounts, if any on the senior secured debt we expect to redeem or repay, as applicable, as part of the Transactions.

In order to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions to facilitate the digitalization of their processes, we have been integrating AI solutions and tools across our entire product suite to enhance automation, predictive capabilities and overall efficiency, thereby elevating customer experience and increasing productivity. Moreover, we have continuously evolved our product suite and underlying technologies. Based on our innovative SaaS platform, we have developed a comprehensive set of cloud-based software products that allowed us to penetrate the large segment of micro and small businesses customers in Italy, which have not historically utilized on premise software solutions mainly due to their relative complexity, enabling us to maintain a strong leadership position among accountants and mid-sized business customer. In addition, due to our technologically advanced and fully developed and integrated suite of digital products such as HR, Digital Signature, Digital Finance solutions, authentication, customer analytics and relationship management, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to exploit the growing demand for digitalization solutions in both our Italian and international relevant sectors. We expect that the demand for digitalization solutions will continue to grow, driven by supportive regulations and incentives, as well as the need for customers to adapt to a changing environment that demands operational efficiency and automation. For example, in Italy we foresee potential opportunities from the upcoming tax reform on e-receipts which is expected to extend further than the current e-invoicing prescribed for businessto-business relationships.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.3,,"We are the leading provider of cloud-based mission critical ERP, FMS and e-invoicing software for micro, small and mid-market businesses as well as professional customers in Italy, with a growing international presence, including in Spain and Turkey. Our mission is to improve the competitiveness of our customers, supporting them with the digitalization and automation of their internal and external business processes through our premium cloud-based product offering and solutions which also connect businesses, professionals and public administration organizations. Our products include software solutions for the core business processes of accountants and labor consultants (such as the provision of tax and accounting advice and payroll services) and a suite of financial management, accounting management, enterprise asset management, human capital management, production and supply chain management, administration and invoicing management and customer management software solutions, bolstered by AI and data analysis tools, for micro, small and mid-market businesses. We also offer onpremise solutions providing assistance and software maintenance services for all our products, nonetheless we actively support and transition our customers to cloud and SaaS native solutions, through a dual-track operating model to assist them in their transformation journey. Across industries, we embrace customer demand for digitalization solutions for business processes that, until recently, had not been automated or digitalized. Customers who utilize our integrated cloud-based solutions may digitally execute a variety of tasks, such as invoicing, document signing and other business management processes, which allows them to reduce their overall expenses and increase their business efficiency. Our easy-to-use integrated cloud-based software products have also enabled us to target micro business customers who have historically not utilized higher-functionality and more complex on premise business management software, and drive the digitalization shift for core business management processes. We believe we have established positions across all key segments in which we operate. As of June 30, 2023, we held an approximately 30% share in the small and mid-market businesses customer segment and more than 30% share in the professionals customer segment, in each case in Italy, based on number of seats (IDC). In addition, according to the Global Consulting Company Report, we held more than 30% share in the micro businesses customer segment in terms of value over the same period. As of June 30, 2023, we had a growing or established presence in the sectors in which we operate, including Digital Finance, HCM, payroll and industry-specific sectors, with shares of up to 22% in some of these segments. Moreover, as of June 30, 2023, our strategic operations and leadership enabled us to achieve a share of approximately 4% in Spain and approximately 14% in Turkey, based on revenue generated within these sectors divided by the estimated SAM of each sector and expressed as a percentage thereof, thus successfully establishing our presence in these growing sectors. We offer our products and services through six main business units: - Professional Solutions. Our Professional Solutions business unit includes software for professionals, including accountants, and labor consultants, including accounting, payroll, billing and compliance tools. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Professional Solutions business unit accounted for 28.3% of our total revenue. ----- - Micro Solutions. Our Micro Solutions business unit includes cloud-based products designed for micro and small business customers (0-9 employees and 10-49 employees, respectively), such as Fatture in Cloud, Contabilità in Cloud and Cassa in Cloud. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Micro Solutions business unit accounted for 27.2% of our total revenue. - Enterprise Solutions. Our Enterprise Solutions business unit includes ERP and FMS software for midmarket business customers (10-500 employees), including administration, finance, human resources, sales, supply chain management and production. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 our Enterprise Solutions business unit accounted for 22.0% of our total revenue. - Market Specific Solutions. Our Market Specific Solutions business unit includes products and services designed to address the needs of customers in specific industries, such as, among others, mechanical and manufacturing, construction, CAF/public sectors and legal, and the needs for all business sizes from micro to mid-size. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Market Specific Solutions business unit accounted for 12.9% of our total revenue. - Cross Segment Product Solutions. Our Cross Segment Product Solutions offers HR and Trust solutions, including digital signature, archive and digital identity services, which are fully integrated with our ERP systems. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Cross Segment Product Solutions business unit accounted for 6.8% of our total revenue. - Digital Finance Solutions. Our Digital Finance Solutions business unit includes digital financial valueadded services designed to streamline financial operations of our customers and address their needs, such as rating services, credit management and digital payment solutions. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Digital Finance Solutions business unit accounted for 2.8% of our total revenue. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of €778.7 million (compared to €423 million for the year ended December 31, 2020) and €334.8 million (compared to €209 million for the year ended December 31, 2020), respectively. The following chart sets forth our total revenue breakdown by business unit for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 83.5% of our total revenue from recurring sources, which are primarily related to annual software assistance and maintenance contracts, annual subscription contracts, annual fees from our multi-year contracts with VARs and fees from temporary annual licenses (licenze _temporanee annuali) that we sell to our customers whenever the Italian government introduces a new regulatory_ obligation (e.g., a new tax digital reporting obligation or tax payment) that requires a dedicated feature to be added to our software products (we refer to such temporary annual licenses as “Regulatory LTAs”). We believe that our technology leadership, significant and ongoing expansion of our cloud-based solutions, the mission-critical nature of our products and the overall willingness of our customers to renew their contracts have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our high annual subscription contracts and renewal rates. Most of our products are deeply integrated into our end-customers’ IT systems and business processes, and their replacement is normally a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process, requiring extensive training for users. In addition, our digital and cloud-based solutions platform, Digital Invoice, designed to operate across all our digital products, is integrated with all our ERP solutions and allows our customers to digitally send, receive, register and store electronic invoices from and to private customers, companies, public entities, banks and external accountants and to send tax filings to the relevant tax authorities electronically. ----- Our three key customer groups are micro and small businesses, mid-market businesses and professionals, which are located both in Italy and abroad. Our end-customer base, including VAR’s end-customers, increased from approximately 88,000 as of December 31, 2009 to approximately 2.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Of this total figure, approximately 87.7% are micro and small businesses, approximately 8.6% are mid-market businesses and approximately 3.7% are professionals. Our large and diverse customer base is highly fragmented and diversified in terms of size and geography. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 276 thousand customers outside of Italy, our ten largest customers generated 5.0% of our total revenue, while our 50 largest customers and 200 largest customers generated 10.4% and 15.3%, respectively. Our customer base is also spread across a variety of industries, including accountancy, labor advisory, manufacturing, industrial, construction, wellness, hospitality, fashion, retail, distribution, food and beverage, legal and other professional services sectors. We have strategically internalized our VARs to establish stronger and more direct relationships with our customer base. This approach allows us to provide personalized and seamless services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Such approach also supports our upselling initiatives, offering tailored solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients and aiding them in the continuing transition to cloud solutions. Through these efforts, we ensure our clients benefit from the latest technological advancements while maintaining our competitive edge in the field. In furtherance of our internalization strategy, we have continued to pursue a series of bolt-on acquisitions to bolster our competitive position, expand our product offerings and continue our international expansion. In recent years, we expanded into Spain by acquiring a controlling interest in the Spanish start-up Billin and consolidated our presence in the country by acquiring Software del Sol. In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio with acquisitions such as Acumbamail and Aplifisa, and entered the Turkish sector by acquiring the Mikro group. Lastly, in 2024, we entered into an acquisition agreement with the French ERP software provider to continue expand our presence outside of Italy. Our acquisitions have contributed positively to our revenue growth, product and business mix diversification. This acquisition strategy is key to our growth plan, driving sustained expansion and reinforcing our leadership in the sector. We implemented a series of nominal price increases across our customer segments. In the micro and small businesses customer segment, prices were raised by a total of 10 percentage points from 2021 to 2023, due to a high inflationary environment. In the mid-market segment, we saw a nominal price increase of 3.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023, while in the professionals customer segment, also from 2020 to 2023, prices increased by 7.0 percentage points over the same period. During these periods, we also observed changes in customer churn. In the micro and small businesses segment, churn decreased by 0.2 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. The mid-market segment experienced a slight 0.5 percentage points churn increase between 2020 and 2023, and in the professionals customer segment, churn decreased by 1.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023. We divide our product offering into the following three product suites and five horizontal solutions:",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.1,Recurring contracted revenues and high Customer Retention Rate,"For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 81.6%, 82.0%, 82.5% and 86.2% of our total revenue, respectively, from sources that we consider to be recurring. We deem revenues to be recurring if we expect to generate such revenues in more than one year, either based on specific contractual arrangements or in our experience. We attribute recurring nature to a significant part of our revenues primarily due to our business model and customer loyalty. Our recurring revenues are primarily derived from periodic payments we receive in connection with annual software assistance and maintenance contracts, subscription contracts, annual fees from our multi-year contracts with VARs, as well as from the sale of Regulatory LTAs. In particular, whenever a new regulatory requirement has an impact on our software (e.g., a new tax filing obligation or payment), our end-customers and VARs may purchase from us a dedicated temporary annual license (licenza temporanea annuale) (“Regulatory LTA”) for the software enhancement that enables end-customers to comply with the new rule through a new software feature. Regulatory LTA fees are of a recurring nature as they are paid to us on an annual basis, on top of the end-customer’s base contract flat fee or the VARs’ fees, as applicable. As a consequence of the significant expansion of our cloud-based solutions in the periods under review, our fee structure has increasingly shifted from a license and maintenance model to a subscription model. In the license and maintenance model, customers generally make a one-off payment for the purchase of a temporary or perpetual license at the outset of the contracts and are then required to make periodic payments (e.g., on an annual basis) for assistance and maintenance services and/or software upgrades. Conversely, in the subscription model, revenues are almost entirely of a recurring nature as they mainly consist of fees from subscriptions, which are renewed annually and generate periodic payments from our customers. Our price increase management process is based on two main components, i.e. our “more-for-more” pricing model and inflation-driven price adjustments. We believe that our strategic application of the “more-for-more” pricing model has been a significant driver of our recurring revenue increase. This approach uses various factors to determine price adjustments, while minimizing customer churn and maximizing product value. For more information on our “more-for-more” pricing model, see “—Cross-selling and up-selling initiatives.” The price adjustments that we implemented reflect our continuous efforts to improve our product offering resulted in the increase of the contribution of recurring revenue as a percentage of our total revenue, as such price adjustments affected recurring fee sources (i.e. maintenance and subscriptions). Moreover, we have the ability to unilaterally adjust prices in line with inflation rates without prior notification to customers. This automatic adjustment mechanism is primarily driven by macroeconomic conditions characterized by high inflation, such as those experienced in 2022 and 2023. During these periods, we implemented price increases to reflect the inflationary environment, particularly in Italy. This approach has enabled us to maintain our pricing strategy effectively, ensuring that our revenue growth keeps pace with inflation without incurring additional costs. Our price increases are generally not reversed, largely due to our strong position as a crucial solution provider that is difficult to replace. Furthermore, our ability to adjust prices in inflationary times has enabled us to maintain a balanced and proactive pricing strategy, contributing to our positive financial outcomes. We believe that customer loyalty also significantly contributes to the recurring nature of our revenues, adding stability to our revenue flow. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we have experienced high and stable Customer Retention Rates of approximately (i) 93.1%, 92.9% and 93.3%, respectively, for micro and small business customers; 96.5%, 95.7% and 95.3%, respectively, for mid-market business customers; and (iii) 95.7%, 95.5% and 96.4%, respectively, for professionals. See “Certain definitions—Customer Retention Rate.” We believe that the loyalty of our customers is due to both their satisfaction (as attested by a NPS score measured by consultancy firm Nielsen of +55 as of March 31, 2024 with our products and the relatively high costs, time, other resources and risks required to switch software providers. In particular, most of our products are deeply integrated into our end-customers’ IT systems and business processes and their replacement is normally a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process, which may entail certain operational risks. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.2,Growth of our cloud business,"For the periods under review, revenue from cloud products and services increased from €214.6 million (or 43.9% of our total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2021 (on a pro forma basis) to €251.5 million (or 44.3% of our total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2022, €357.4 million (or 48.6% of our total revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2023 and €388.7 million (or 49.9% of our total revenue) for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. The increased contribution of our cloud business to our overall business is a result of the ongoing shift of our fee structure from a license and maintenance model to a subscription model, where revenues are almost entirely of a recurring nature (see “—Recurring contracted revenues and high Customer Retention Rate” above). This increased contribution has also been driven by our investments to enrich our cloud-based products, which enables us to offer tailored solutions and meet the specific needs both larger and sophisticated clients and smaller customers. In recent years, the growth of our cloud business has been driven by our efforts to assist our customers to transition from on premise solutions to cloud solutions and develop a range of innovative cloud products as well as a result of our merger and acquisition strategy to expand our cloud platform through SaaS business applications with cross-sell potential. To enable the transition to cloud products, we developed a comprehensive set of cloud-based versions of our most successful on premise software products, such as TeamSystem Enterprise and TeamSystem Studio. In addition, we developed additional cloud-native products, such as Fatture in Cloud, Contabilità in Cloud, Cassa in Cloud, TeamSystem Digital Invoice, TeamSystem Digital Sign, TeamSystem Digital Archive and TS Pay, which have allowed us to penetrate the large and previously untapped market of micro and small customers in Italy, who have not historically utilized on premise software solutions, mainly due to their relative complexity. We believe the growth of our cloud business is sustainable, as customers increasingly opt for cloud-based software and solutions that can be accessed from different locations and through various devices. As part of our strategy, we continue to offer our current customers new cloud products (including cloud-native products) and tap new customers through our various distribution channels. Our cloud-based products are sold via our subscription model, thus supporting the recurring portion of our total revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key factors affecting our results of operations,17.2.3,Acquisitions,"Our operating results and their comparability for the periods under review were impacted by the effects of a number of bolt-on acquisitions. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margins, cash flow, cost and revenue synergies and return on investment targets before we proceed with the relevant acquisition. Between January 1, 2021 and March 31, 2024, we acquired majority stakes in or the entire capital stock of 62 companies (excluding the transactions where we only increased our stake in previously acquired companies). In particular, we made eight acquisitions in 2021, 13 acquisition in 2022, 30 acquisitions in 2023 and 11 acquisitions during the three months ended March 31, 2024. We believe that the acquisitions we made in the period under review have generated synergies for our business and have contributed to our growth. Such acquisitions have enabled us to (i) accelerate revenue growth on clients previously managed by VARs, (ii) cross-sell the newly acquired products to our existing customer base and (iii) enrich our product offering in key strategic areas. For example, the acquisitions of Readytec and Progetto Studio allowed us to accelerate upselling on our customer base, the acquisition of while MailUp and Acumbamail in 2023 strengthened our capabilities in the marketing automation sector. Additionally, our acquisition of Mikrogroup in 2023 allowed us to enter the Turkish segment, significantly enhancing our presence in the Mediterranean region. Historically, we have funded our bolt-on acquisitions primarily with cash from operations, as well as third party and shareholder debt. In addition, as part of our acquisition strategy and depending on the actual circumstances of each acquisition, we often seek to initially purchase a controlling stake in the acquired business, with the stake remaining with the relevant sellers being subject to certain earn out arrangements and put and call options, which enable us to acquire full ownership of the relevant business at an agreed point in time. For a description of the most significant acquisitions we carried out in the periods under review, see “—Factors _affecting the comparability of our results of operations—Bolt-on acquisitions made by the Group” and for a_ description of our liabilities in connection with the put and call option and earn out arrangements under the acquisition agreements with our strategic partners relating to our majority-owned subsidiaries, see “—Contractual _obligations—Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries.” As part of the Transactions, on or_ shortly after the Issue Date, we plan to use a portion of the proceeds of this Offering to buy out the stakes held by non-controlling shareholders of certain of our subsidiaries. See “Use of proceeds” and “Risk Factors—Risks _related to our business—Certain of our subsidiaries have non-controlling shareholders whose interests may differ_ ----- _from our interests. In addition, the contractual arrangements with such non-controlling shareholders may require us to purchase shares at predetermined prices under certain put and call options and to make payments under certain earn out arrangements.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

For example, as part of the Italian government digitalization program, all invoices to the Italian central and local public administration organizations must be submitted electronically since March 2015. From January 1, 2019, all invoices issued by businesses with revenues higher than €65,000 per year (excluding healthcare professionals) must be electronic. As of January 1, 2024, this requirement extends to all flat-rate regime taxpayers, regardless of their annual earnings. As a consequence of these innovative requirements, the total number of electronic invoices sent to the Italian Revenue Agency’s exchange system (Sistema di Interscambio–“SDI”) increased from approximately two million in 2014 to approximately 2.1 billion in 2019. We believe that part of the growth of our cloud business for the periods under review, and, in particular, the increase in sales of our electronic invoicing software products, such as Fatture in Cloud and TeamSystem Digital Invoice, was driven by this new regulatory requirement. In addition, whenever the Italian government introduces a new regulatory obligation (e.g., a new tax digital reporting obligation or tax payment) that requires a dedicated feature to be added to our software products, we create such additional software feature and sell it through Regulatory LTAs, aimed at upgrading the relevant software to facilitate compliance with the new regulatory requirements. Customer payments relating to Regulatory LTAs form part of our recurring revenue, as we require customers to pay an annual amount to maintain the related software feature. In the periods under review, newly introduced Regulatory LTAs included: (i) in 2020 and 2021, the “COVID-19” (regarding the requirement to report and manage workplace outbreaks of COVID-19, ensuring compliance with health and safety regulations aimed at mitigating the spread of the virus within the workplace), (ii) in 2022, the “Crisi d’impresa” (regarding the requirements to monitor the financial health indicators of an enterprise, facilitating early detection of financial distress, and supporting the negotiated settlement process with creditors) and (iii) in 2023, the “Superbonus” (regarding the requirements to obtain a tax deduction on expenses related to energy efficiency improvements and seismic retrofitting of houses and condominiums). Our recurring revenue from Regulatory LTAs will be supplemented by the introduction of the “Concordato Preventivo” in June 2024, regarding the new reporting and calculation methods required for determining taxable income of small businesses and professionals in Italy.

Our results of operations may be affected by general economic conditions in Italy, including their impact on our customers. A downturn in the Italian economy can affect IT spending generally, demand and pricing for our products and services, the creditworthiness of our customers and other counterparties (such as VARs), the ability of other software companies to compete effectively, and the availability and cost of debt financing. From 2011 to 2023 our organic total revenue (calculated for any given year as our total revenue for such year less the revenue of the companies we acquired in such year) grew at an average year-on-year growth rate of 7.0%, outperforming the Italian GDP growth for the same period by 6.5% points per year on average. From 2011 to 2014, when the effects of the financial crisis that adversely affected global financial markets and economies from 2008 were particularly strong and Italy’s GDP decreased at an average year-on-year growth rate of 1.0%, our organic total revenue grew at an average year-on-year growth rate of 4.5%, outperforming Italian GDP by 5.5 percentage points per year on average thus demonstrating the resilience of our business. From 2017 to 2019, Italy’s GDP showed signs of recovery with a positive growth of 1.4% on average per year. Over such period, our organic total revenue outperformed the Italian GDP, growing on average at 7.5% year-on-year. From 2021 to 2023, Italian GDP grew at an average year-on-year growth rate of 4.4%, recovering from the negative growth of 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. During this same period, our organic total revenue outperformed the Italian GDP by 5.6%, growing on average at 10.0% year-on-year. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA grew at a CAGR of 35.8% from 2021 to 2023 and our Adjusted EBITDA margin increased from 41.4% in 2021 to 42.8% in 2023. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

While we invoice fees for certain services upon delivery, the majority of our revenue is of a recurring nature. In particular, in our Enterprise Solutions and Professional Solutions business units, which represented 22.4% and 29.3% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023, we mostly invoice our fees in advance at the beginning of each calendar year during our annual budgeting process. Typically, our contracts within these business units are renewed unless customers provide a written termination notice at least six months prior to the expiration of such contracts. Given that we are required to pay the VAT charges on such invoices before collecting the related receivables, our working capital needs are particularly high in the first quarter, reaching their peak at the end of the first quarter, and then gradually decreasing through the end of the year. In addition, in our Micro Solutions business unit, our revenue is predominantly recurring, primarily derived from annual subscription fees. Customers are invoiced in advance, typically prior to the renewal of the annual service, and trade receivables are generally collected within approximately three months. Although we have the ability to terminate services if fees are not collected when due, our working capital requirements for the Micro Solutions business unit can fluctuate significantly due to the 12-month rolling basis of our invoicing and the limited control we have over the timing of customer subscriptions. We believe that our billing pattern enables us to effectively predict and monitor our revenue and cash flow levels and working capital needed. See “—Net Working capital.” Our average days delinquent, which for any given period measures the average number of days between the date on which our trade receivables fall due and the date on which the relevant payments are made by our customers, improved significantly from 2021 to 2023 and marginally in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In recent years, we implemented a comprehensive cost savings initiative for both direct and indirect costs, referred to as “Project Delorean,” which is designed to optimize operational performance and drive financial results through a series of strategic actions across several areas of our organization. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this initiative is ongoing as intended and all planned actions have been implemented. In particular, we have targeted the marginality of selected solutions dedicated to specific clusters of customers and business units, such as Digital Finance, through increased effectiveness and cost streamlining. To boost our sales productivity, we have increased our reliance on virtual sales by redirecting lower complexity deals from field channels to digital platforms, which contributed €0.7 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, we have acquired and internalized certain of our VARs, thereby contributing €1.8 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023. These efforts are aimed at enhancing sales productivity while reducing associated costs. As part of our streamlining of general and administrative functions, we have applied process digitization to reduce operational overhead and enhance procurement excellence through increased centralization. We have also extended our “Light Friday” initiative, which reduces the working week by 10%, contributing to lower personnel costs without compromising overall productivity. This initiative contributed €1.5 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our continuous effort toward facilities rationalization is another cornerstone of our cost savings strategy. By optimizing the use of our physical infrastructure, we aim to reduce overhead costs significantly. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the rationalization of our facilities, including the closure of some of them, contributed €0.4 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA. We are also streamlining travel and expenses, further minimizing unnecessary expenditures. The nearshoring of our R&D operations to Albania is a strategic move to reduce costs while maintaining highquality research and development capabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, this initiative contributed €1.6 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA. We are also optimizing our cloud infrastructure and thirdparty software spending to further reduce IT-related costs. By focusing on customer service and delivery efficiency, we are optimizing our customer service channel mix, expanding and improving digital offerings such ----- as chatbots and self-care options and expanding the remote delivery of services. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these initiatives contributed €1.1 million in cost savings to our Adjusted EBITDA. The Project Delorean initiative is designed to enhance customer experience while reducing costs, which have resulted in significant cost savings, which for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to approximately €12.8 million.

Digital Finance encompasses a suite of solutions designed to integrate financial value and supply chains, providing digital payment and credit services tailored to specific industry needs. We have expanded our Digital Finance solutions across all customer segments and industries, promoting certain solutions such as TS Pay. We have also expanded our Extended CRM solutions to our mid-market businesses as well as micro and small business customers, as we believe these customers can benefit from the integration of advanced tools for customer relationship management, marketing automation and e-commerce integration to enhance customer analytics and relationship management. Our HR Solutions provide an integrated suite of adaptable digital tools capable of assisting all our customer segments in efficiently managing payroll and human resources, also due to the full integration with our ERP and FMS software. Following the digitalization tailwinds of SMEs, we have expanded HR Solutions to streamline their human capital management, payroll and welfare activities. These cross-selling activities also contribute to higher Customer Retention Rates, as customers who use multiple products and services are more satisfied and likely to remain loyal. Our “more-for-more” pricing strategy repositions our existing customers to more advanced or premium versions of our products and services, driving the increase in our ARPU. This approach combines in-depth customer analysis and competitor benchmarking with a predictive algorithm that considers over 75 features to forecast customer price elasticity and determine optimal price adjustments. By segmenting customers into micro-clusters and conducting A/B testing, we tailor price increases to minimize churn and maximize value. Our model allows customers to trial additional features at no cost, evaluating their benefits before these are integrated into the base offering with adjusted pricing.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Information”).,17.4.2,Revenue recognition,"IFRS 15 establishes the criteria for recognizing revenue arising from contracts with customers, except for those contracts that fall within the scope of the standards relating to leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. The standard establishes a comprehensive framework for identifying the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized in the financial statements. According to IFRS 15, an entity shall recognize revenue arising from contracts with customers and the related accounting effects through the following steps: (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. As a result, the amount the TeamSystem Group recognizes as revenue should reflect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods transferred to the customer and/or services rendered. This amount should be recognized when the underlying contractual obligations have been satisfied, which is when the TeamSystem Group has transferred control of the promised goods or service to the customer, in the following ways: (i) over time; or (ii) at a point in time. The following are the main types of products and services of our six main business units, categorized by: (i) Recurring Revenue; (ii) Software licences; and (iii) professional services. _Recurring_ Our main recurring revenue-generating streams are: - Assistance and Maintenance/Subscription, comprising revenue from assistance and maintenance fees and subscription fees. Assistance and maintenance fees are normally associated with license agreements (our “license and maintenance model”), while when a customer enters into a subscription agreement, a fee is paid in order to both utilize a particular software product and benefit from customer support, technical assistance and maintenance and software updates (our “subscription model”). The related revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term, with recognition of the revenue component pertaining to future years as deferred income, which is accounted for as a liability. In addition, this category includes revenue from VAR agreements, which generally cover a three-year period and include an annual fixed fee that grants VARs the right to download an unlimited number of software licenses and to receive software updates and system support services, with revenue arising from these agreements recognized on a straight line basis over the agreement term. Annual fee adjustments are also envisaged (either positive or negative with respect to the contractual consideration) based on the financial performance of the VAR, as determined by a calculation formula set out in the relevant VAR agreement. - Regulatory LTAs, comprising revenue from the sale of Regulatory LTAs, which are charged to our customer on top of the relevant customer’s base contract fee and are recognized on a straight line from the download date. Renewals of Regulatory LTAs automatically take place at the beginning of each year. ----- _Licenses and professional services_ Our revenues from licenses and professional services derive from: - Licenses, comprising revenues from the sale of software licenses, which are recognized when control of the software is transferred to the customer (usually on the delivery date), on account of all contractual obligations typically being fulfilled and the fact that there are no rights of return or acceptance clauses in our software licenses. In the event that a sale agreement provides for more than one revenue component, such as maintenance and support, the revenue arising from these components is separately identifiable in the agreement. - Professional services, which generate fees generally related to the installation and customization of our software solutions products and to the training services we provide to the customers at the product start-up. Service fees are generally one-off fees and therefore do not generate recurring revenue. Revenue related to software implementation services that are ongoing at the reporting date is recognized based on the percentage of completion of the services at such reporting date. Finally, revenues deriving from sales of hardware components purchased from third parties are recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer (usually on the delivery date), on account of all contractual obligations typically being fulfilled and the fact that there are no rights of return or acceptance clauses in the relevant contracts. _Costs_ Our costs consist mainly of cost of raw and other materials, cost of services, personnel costs, depreciation and amortization of non-current assets, allowance for bad debts and provisions for risks and charges. Cost of raw and other materials mainly relates to the cost of sales of third party software, hardware, fuel, manuals and materials for education. Cost of services consist primarily of agent commissions and other costs, advertising and marketing expenses, software and hardware maintenance costs, fees associated with consulting and copyrights for our education materials, fees paid to consultants for professional services, consulting and third parties services expenses, corporate expenses and overhead expenses. Personnel costs represent our largest operating expense and consist primarily of salaries and wages, social security costs, allowance for staff severance indemnity, directors’ fees and other labor expenses. Depreciation expense of non-current assets primarily relates to depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Amortization expense of non-current assets primarily relates to the cost of software, trademarks, patents and licenses, the amortization of customer relationships and of capitalized development expenses. In particular, development costs in relation to a particular project are capitalized only when our directors can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the project so that it will be available for use or sale, the intention to complete the project and use or sell it, how the project is expected to generate future economic benefits and the availability and amount of resources required to complete the project. Allowance for bad debts is determined by us on the basis of losses expected to be incurred on receivables, determined on the basis of past experience with similar receivables, on current and historical past due, on losses and payment collection and on careful monitoring of asset quality and forecasts of economic and market conditions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In particular, total revenue increased as a result of (i) the first time consolidation of the several companies of which we acquired a business unit (B&T Software & Service S.n.c.; 2K Soft S.r.l.; Slware S.r.l.; Next S.r.l.; Nordest Informatica S.r.l.; Giesse Dati S.r.l.; Zuffellato Technologies S.r.l.; L’informatica S.r.l.; Isigest S.r.l.

In addition, the continued adoption of e-invoicing products, largely driven by e-invoicing regulation, was a primary driver of our organic growth.

For further information, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of _operations—Revenue recognition—Recurring” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Recurring contracted revenues and high Customer Retention Rate.”_ Recurring revenue is not a recognized measure of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS financial measures.” (b) Includes revenues from the sale of software licenses, and professional services, which generate fees generally related to the installation and customization of our software solutions products and to the training services we provide to the customers at the product start-up. For further information, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Revenue _recognition—Licenses and professional services.”_ Enterprise Business Unit revenue increased by €6.6 million, or 17.6%, from €37.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €44.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue driven by the consolidation of newly acquired companies (mainly internalized VARs) and the expansion of the business. The organic growth of recurring revenues in the Enterprise Business Unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 7.6%. Professional Business Unit revenue increased by €5.6 million, or 10.9%, from €51.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €56.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of an increase in recurring revenue resulting from the consolidation of newly acquired companies (mainly internalized VARs) and the expansion of the business. The organic growth of recurring revenues in the Professional Business Unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 5.8%. Micro Business Unit revenue increased by €30.1 million, or 89.6%, from €33.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €63.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly as a result of the revenue ----- generated by then-recently acquired companies (including MailUp S.p.A., Mikro and Aplifisa S.L.) and an increase in recurring revenue from sales of FMS solutions for micro businesses and e-invoicing products. The growth in revenue from sales of e-invoicing solutions was largely driven by the final wave of businesses and individuals required to comply with Italian Law No. 205 of December 27, 2017 (Legge di Bilancio), which mandates electronic invoicing for business transactions and the filing of electronic invoices directed to local and central public administrations. Additionally, revenue in this business unit was also driven by strong international sales both in Spain and Turkey. The organic growth of recurring revenues in the Micro Business Unit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 21.8%. Digital Finance Business Unit revenue increased by €1.0 million, or 22.2%, from €4.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly as a result of the increase in recurring revenue deriving from an increase in the volume of sales of TS Pay, the introduction of new services in TS Pay (e.g., Account Information Service), as well as increasing sales of our rating solutions. Revenue generated from our financial value chain offerings, which include various financial products facilitating e-lending, fiscal trading, and other financial solutions, remained stable. This stability is attributed to our new e-lending solution being in the ramp-up phase, while demand for fiscal trading was negatively affected by legislative changes, such as those impacting the 110% Ecobonus, a tax incentive in Italy designed to promote energy-efficient upgrades through significant tax deductions in the form of credits. These legislative changes directly affect the trading and management of such tax credits within our products, leading to fluctuations in the demand for our fiscal trading services. Market Specific Solutions Business Unit revenue increased by €0.4 million, or 1.7%, from €22.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €23.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of the increase in recurring revenue due to customers’ ongoing switch to subscription-based services, which was partially offset by lower demand of our hardware and machinery tools. Cross-Segment Products Business Unit revenue increased by €1.9 million, or 17.0%, from €11.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €13.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a result of the increase in recurring revenue driven by the performance of the three core HR solutions, Welfare, BPaaS, and TS HR. _Cost of raw and other materials_ Cost of raw and other materials increased by €0.7 million, or 5.6%, from €12.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €13.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, mainly as a result of the increase in the sales (and corresponding costs) of hardware products and the use of third party’s software, due to the organic growth of the business and the change in consolidation perimeter. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of raw and other materials decreased by 1.4 percentage points from 7.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 6.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. _Cost of services_ Cost of services increased by €10.0 million, or 24.0%, from €41.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €51.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The increase mainly reflected the overall increase in costs related to intracloud and other external cost required to manage our solutions, agent commissions and other costs attributable to commercial consulting services, marketing expenses and other service expenses. These cost increases were also due to the organic growth of the business and the change in consolidation perimeter. Cost of services for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was partially offset by a decrease in the costs for noncore services. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of services decreased by 0.9 percentage points from 25.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 25.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €12.6 million, or 25.6%, from €49.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €61.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to the increase in personnel, as consequence of our organic growth and the acquisitions carried out in the first three months of 2024. As a percentage of total revenue, personnel costs decreased by 0.7 percentage point from 30.6% in the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 29.9% in the three months ended March 31, 2024. ----- _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs increased by €0.3 million, or 20.0%, from €1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the condominium expenses related to new rental arrangements entered into in the first three months of 2024. _Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets_ Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets increased by €7.3 million, or 14.1%, from €51.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €59.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, due to due to higher amortization charges as a result of the purchase price allocation process in connection with several acquisitions, including, among others, the acquisition of Mikro, MailUp S.r.l., Aplifisa S.L. and Microntel S.p.A. _Allowance for bad debts_ Allowance for bad debts increased by €0.3 million, or 18.8%, from €1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to €1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase is attributable to the change in the reporting perimeter following recent acquisitions. On a like-for-like basis, the incidence of bad debts over revenues has slightly improved from 1.0% to 0.9%. As a percentage of total revenue, Allowance for bad debts decreased by 0.1 percentage point from 1.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 0.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. _Operating result_ Operating result increased by €14.2 million from €2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €16.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as a consequence of the factors discussed above and, in particular, the increase of total revenue, which more than offset the overall cost increase. _Finance income_ Finance income increased by €5.4 million, or 174.2%, from €3.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €8.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase of the valuation at market value on March 31, 2024 of certain interest rate swap derivative contracts entered into in April 2022 and classified as non-hedge accounting. Finance income also increased as a result of the interest earned from the foregoing derivative instruments. _Finance cost_ Finance cost increased by €13.0 million, or 38.5%, from €33.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €46.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to an increase in the interest expense resulting from the addition of our Existing 2023 Private Notes and the increase of the average Euribor rate applied to our variable rate indebtedness. The increase in finance cost was partially offset by a loss on the valuation of certain derivative instruments. _Monetary net gain/(loss)_ Monetary gain increased from €0 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €17.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to the increase in the reported value of the monetary assets of our subsidiaries operating in Turkey (which we acquired in September 2023 and, thus, we did not control during the three months ended March 31, 2023) after adjusting for hyperinflation according to IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies). _Total income taxes_ Total income taxes increased by €4.3 million from a positive balance of €2.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to a negative balance of €1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily as a consequence of the increase in current income taxes mainly due to the organic growth of the business. This increase was partially offset by a €1.2 million increase in the positive effect of deferred income taxes. ----- _Profit/(Loss) for the period_ For the three months ended March 31, 2023 we recorded a loss of €25.3 million, while for the three months ended March 31, 2024 we recorded a loss of €5.1 million. Such positive trend was due to the reasons discussed above. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €21.0 million, or 34.0%, from €61.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €82.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the change in the consolidation area as a result of our acquisition activity and to the organic growth in the first three months of 2024. For further details, see the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA presented under “Summary historical _financial information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data.” The change in the consolidation area_ and the organic growth in the first three months of 2024 also positively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin, which increased from 38.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 40.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2024.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

This growth was mainly the result of our organic growth due to higher spending from existing customers through cross-selling between our HR, Trust Services, Extended CRM and Digital Finance product lines, and the acquisition of new customers. Total revenue also increased by the first time consolidation of the several companies in which we acquired a controlling interest or a 100% interest in 2023 and which contributed €84.5 million (primarily relating to the consolidation of Readytec S.p.A., MailUp S.p.A. and Mikro) to the overall revenue increase and the revenue contribution of the bolt-on acquisitions we made in the year ended December 31, 2022, which did not therefore have a full-period impact in such year. ----- Our total revenue broken down by business unit for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 was as follows[(*)]:",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

As a result of this reallocation, a new business unit, now referred to as “Cross-Segment Products,” was created, replacing the former HR business unit. Therefore, the revenue breakdown by business unit for the periods and fiscal years prior to March 31, 2024, presented in this Offering Memorandum, has been made based on same classification that is reflected in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. See “Presentation of financial and other _information—Business units and revenue breakdowns.”_ (a) Our recurring revenues are primarily derived from periodic payments we receive in connection with annual software assistance and maintenance contracts, subscription contracts, annual fees from our multi-year contracts with VARs as well as from the sale of Regulatory LTAs. For further information, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of _operations—Revenue recognition—Recurring” and “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Key factors affecting our results of operations—Recurring contracted revenues and high Customer Retention Rate.”_ Recurring revenue is not a recognized measure of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other internationally accepted accounting principles and therefore no undue reliance should be placed on such data contained in this Offering Memorandum. See “Presentation of financial and other information—Non-IFRS financial measures.” (b) Includes revenues from the sale of software licenses and professional services, which generate fees generally related to the installation and customization of our software solutions products and to the training services we provide to the customers at the product start-up. For further information, see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Revenue _recognition—Licenses and professional services.”_ Enterprise Business Unit revenue increased by €39.5 million, or 31.6%, from €125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €164.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue driven by the accelerated transition from sales of software licenses to subscription-based services as well as the change in consolidation perimeter, which also drove the increase in other revenue. Professional Business Unit revenue increased by €46.0 million, or 27.3%, from €168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €214.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue and, in particular, revenue deriving from enhanced sales of cloud solutions due to upselling, migration to cloud-based alternatives and our “more-for-more” strategy that offers to customers enhanced features, services, and benefits at a higher price point. Micro Business Unit revenue increased by €62.1 million, or 51.9%, from €119.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €181.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of the revenue generated by then-recently acquired companies (including MailUp S.p.A., Mikro and Aplifisa S.L.) and a strong increase in recurring revenue driven by higher sales across all customer segments and, particularly, micro and small businesses as well as vertical segments, including international customers. Notably, substantial revenue was generated in the Spanish segment that outperformed overall market growth. ----- Digital Finance Business Unit revenue increased by €2.9 million, or 16.1%, from €18.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €20.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue driven by sales derived from usage of TS Pay as well as other revenue derived from sales of our rating solutions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the number or value of invoices being traded or processed through our digital finance platform as a result of legislative changes and high interest rates, which reduced market demand for financing solutions. Market Specific Solutions Business Unit revenue increased by €4.5 million, or 4.7%, from €96.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €100.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue driven by the acceleration of the switch to subscription models of solutions and sales of construction, legal and solutions for CAF. Cross-Segment Products Business Unit revenue increased by €10.2 million, or 25.2%, from €40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €50.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of an increase in recurring revenue driven by sales of our TS HR, Welfare and BPaaS solutions. _Cost of raw and other materials_ Cost of raw and other materials increased by €4.3 million, or 8.4%, from €51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €55.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, mainly as a result of the increase in the sales (and corresponding costs) of hardware products and the use of third party’s software as well as the increase in fuel costs, primarily due to the change in consolidation perimeter as a result of then-recently acquired companies. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of raw and other materials decreased by 1.4 percentage points from 9.0% in 2022 to 7.6% in 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a minor impact on revenue from the cost of goods sold for the year ending December 31, 2023, which increased organically by 4.2% compared to 2022 mainly due to a reduced contribution from low-margin businesses (such as hardware and CAD/CAM) and the optimization of external customer support operations. _Cost of services_ Cost of services increased by €37.6 million, or 26.9%, from €139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €177.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase mainly reflected the overall increase in costs related to intracloud and other external cost required to manage our solutions, marketing expenses, agent commissions and other costs attributable to commercial consulting services, customer support costs, management and administrative consulting costs and costs of non-core services (comprising advisory expenses related to mergers and acquisitions as well as reorganization and cost-saving projects. In addition, the increase of cost of services reflect an increase in certain capitalized product development costs primarily related to key projects, including TS Enterprise, TS Digital, SaaS Applications, STR Construction, and TS Studio. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2023 was partially offset by a decrease in financial interest costs, consulting and copyright costs and other costs for education services. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of services decreased by 0.4 percentage points from 24.6% in 2022 to 24.2% in 2023 as a result of increasing economies of scale that characterize our business. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €41.7 million, or 26.1%, from €160.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €201.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the effect of then-recently acquired companies and partially from the organic growth achieved in 2023, which led to increased employee hires. For the year ended December 31, 2023, personnel costs increased organically by 7.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase has resulted in higher productivity at the Group level, as measured by revenue per full-time employee offset partially by integration of newly acquired companies. As a percentage of total revenue, personnel costs decreased by 0.7 percentage points from 28.2% in 2022 to 27.5% in 2023. The number of full time employees grew from 3,256 as of December 31, 2022 to 4,644 as of December 31, 2023. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs increased by €1.2 million, or 30.8%, from €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to, among other things, an increase in condominium expenses related to new rental arrangements entered into in 2023 following the consolidation of then-recently acquired companies. ----- _Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets_ Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets increased by €15.8 million, or 7.6%, from €208.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €224.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a result of higher amortization charges due to the purchase price allocation process in connection with several acquisitions, including, among others, the acquisition of Sigma Sistemi S.r.l., Readytec S.p.A., Mikro, MailUp S.r.l., Aplifisa S.L. and Microntel S.p.A. Additionally, there was an increase in the amortization of capitalized development costs, driven by both the organic growth in the capitalization of development expenses and the acquisitions made during 2023. _Allowance for bad debts_ Allowance for bad debts increased by €1.5 million, or 27.3% from €5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to €7.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the change in consolidation perimeter as a consequence of the acquisitions in 2023. _Other provisions for risks and charges_ Other provisions for risks and charges decreased by €0.5 million, or 20.8%, from €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in the provision for litigation and disputes relating to the release of risk provisions due to the settlement of certain disputes that arose in previous years. _Impairment of non-current assets_ Impairment of non-current assets decreased from €78.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €0 for the year ended December 31, 2023, due to a goodwill impairment charge that was recorded for the Digital Finance business unit, which was recognized following the results of the annual impairment test conducted for each business unit. No additional impairment of non-current assets has been recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023. _Operating result_ Operating result increased by €141.3 million, from a loss of €81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a gain of €60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the increase in total revenue and the improvement in overall operating margin. _Finance income_ Finance income decreased by €19.4 million, or 44.0%, from €44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €24.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the valuation at market value on December 31, 2023 of certain interest rate swap derivative contracts entered into in April 2022 and classified as non-hedge accounting, partially offset by interest income accrued on the foregoing interest rate swap derivative contracts. _Finance cost_ Finance cost increased by €55.3 million, or 44.5%, from €124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €179.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the interest expenses and financing fees due to the outstanding indebtedness of TeamSystem Group (including the issuance of the Existing 2022 Private Notes) and the Revolving Credit Facility as well as a loss on the valuation of certain derivative instruments. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in the revaluation of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders. _Monetary net gain/(loss)_ Monetary gain increased from nil for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €15.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the increase in the reported value of the monetary assets of our subsidiaries operating in Turkey (which we acquired in September 2023, thus, we did not control during the year ended December 31, 2022) after adjusting for hyperinflation according to IAS 29 (Financial Reporting in _Hyperinflationary Economies)._ ----- _Total income taxes_ Total income taxes decreased by €10.9 million, or 72.7%, from a positive balance of €15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a positive balance of €4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, as a consequence of the increase of €11.8 million in current income taxes mainly due to the increase of the tax base. This increase was partially offset by a €0.9 million increase in the positive effect of deferred income taxes. _Profit/(Loss) for the year_ Loss decreased by €71.3 million, or 48.7%, from a loss of €146.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to a loss of €75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 for the reasons discussed above. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €86.5 million, or 38.1%, from €227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €313.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to both non-organic and organic growth associated with existing customer upsell and new customer acquisition along with less than proportional operating cost increases, primarily due to increased operational efficiency and economies of scale achieved throughout the streamlining of operations and the merger of certain of our subsidiaries into TeamSystem. For further details, see the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA presented under “Summary historical financial information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data.” Improved resale product margins, reduced infrastructure costs for Cloud products, lower personnel costs from hiring timing, and efficiency gains in Customer Operations, R&D, and G&A functions also positively impacted Adjusted EBITDA margin, which increased from 40.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 42.8% for the year ended December 31, 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

This growth was primarily the result of (i) an expansion of our cloud business, which resulted in an increase in recurring revenues, (ii) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) (iii) the first time consolidation of several companies in which we acquired a controlling interest or a 100% interest in 2022 and (iv) the revenue contribution of the bolt-on acquisitions we made in the year ended December 31, 2021, which did not therefore have a full-period impact in such year. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our total revenues would have increased by €79.1 million or 16.2%, from €489.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €568.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In addition, other revenue increased primarily due to the consolidation of then-recently acquired companies. For the year ended December 31, 2022, organic revenues for the Enterprise Business Unit increased by 8.9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a 10.3% increase in recurring revenues. Professional Business Unit revenue increased by €48.5 million, or 40.3%, from €120.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €168.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) an increase in recurring revenue, mainly attributable to contributions from revenue generated by companies acquired in 2021.

Cross-Segment Products Business Unit revenue increased by €11.4 million, or 39.2%, from €29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €40.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, mainly as a result of (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) an increase in recurring revenue driven by the consolidation of then-recently acquired companies and the accelerated adoption of our HR business solutions through cross-selling initiatives within our customer base. _Cost of raw and other materials_ Cost of raw and other materials increased by €15.2 million, or 42.0%, from €36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) the increase in the sales (and corresponding costs) of three-dimensional printing hardware, machinery and the use of third party’s software, primarily due to a strong sales performance in 2022. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of raw and other materials increased by 0.2 percentage point from 8.8% in 2021 to 9.0% in 2022. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our cost of raw and other materials would have increased by €9.7 million or 23.3%, from €41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €51.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Cost of services_ Cost of services increased by €35.0 million, or 34.4%, from €104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase primarily reflected the overall increase of costs related to certain agent commissions, consulting and third party services, advertising and marketing expenses, intracloud and other external costs, as a result of the growth of our business. Cost of services for the year ended December 31, 2022 was partially offset by a decrease in costs of non-core services, comprising costs relating to merger and acquisition transactions completed in 2022 and costs for strategic and reorganization projects. As a percentage of total revenue, cost of services decreased by 0.9 percentage points from 25.5% in 2021 ----- to 24.6% in 2022. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our cost of services would have increased by €26.0 million or 22.9%, from €113.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Personnel costs_ Personnel costs increased by €44.0 million, or 37.9%, from €116.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €160.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the effect of then-recently acquired companies and partially from the organic growth achieved in 2022, which led to increased employee hires. For the year ended December 31, 2022, personnel costs increased organically by 3.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. As a percentage of total revenue, personnel costs remained stable at 30.0% in 2022 from 30.3% 2022, with the number of full time employees increasing from 2,785 as of December 31, 2021 to 3,256 as of December 31, 2022. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our personnel costs would have increased by €18.5 million or 13.1%, from €141.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €160.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Other operating costs_ Other operating costs decreased by €0.6 million, or 13.3%, from €4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of the cost of agreements with customers and agents. _Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets_ Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets increased by €37.9 million, or 22.2%, from €170.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €208.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the increased amortization of intangible IFRS assets due to the acquisition of TeamSystem Group in February 2021 and the subsequent allocation of the price paid for the acquisition which led to an increase in intangible assets. _Allowance for bad debts_ Allowance for bad debts increased by €1.7 million, or 44.7% from €3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) the change in consolidation perimeter as a consequence of the acquisitions in 2022. _Other provisions for risks and charges_ Other provisions for risks and charges increased by €2.3 million, or 2300.0%, from €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due to (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) an increase in the provision for litigation and disputes. _Impairment of non-current assets Impairment of non-current assets increased from €0 for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €78.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to a goodwill impairment charge that was recorded for the Digital Finance business unit, which was recognized following the results of the annual impairment test conducted for each business unit. Operating result_ Operating result decreased by €56.4 million, or 227.4%, from a loss of €24.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a loss of €81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as a consequence of the factors discussed above and, in particular, the impairment of non-current assets. ----- _Finance income_ Finance income increased by €38.4 million or 673.7%, from €5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was largely attributable to (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) the valuation at market value on December 31, 2022 of certain interest rate swap derivative contracts entered into in April 2022 and classified as non-hedge accounting. The increase was also the result of the depreciation of the fair value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries as a result of the re-measurement of the initial exercise price of certain put and call options. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our finance income would have increased by €32.7 million or 28.7%, from €11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €44.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Finance cost_ Finance cost increased by €14.2 million, or 12.9%, from €110.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase is primarily the result of an increase in the interest expense due on the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing 2022 Private Notes and the Existing PIK Notes and the revaluation of Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of finance fees attributed to a lower volume of indebtedness issued in 2022 relative to 2021. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our finance costs would have increased by €24.6 million or 24.6%, from €99.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €124.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Total income taxes_ Total income taxes decreased by €50.3 million or 77.0%, from a positive balance of €65.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to a positive balance of €15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily as a consequence of the (i) the 2021 Acquisition, which closed on February 18, 2021, resulting in the 2021 TeamSystem Group being consolidated in the 2021 Financial Statements only for part of that year (i.e. since the date of the 2021 Acquisition to December 31, 2023) and (ii) decrease in deferred income taxes due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities recorded in 2021 after the revaluation of the tax basis of intangible software and trademark assets by certain legal entities within the Group. The decrease in total income taxes was also due to an increase of €4.9 million in current income taxes. _Profit/(Loss) for the year_ Loss increased by €82.5 million, or 128.2%, from €64.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €146.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, as a consequence of the factors described above. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our loss would have increased by €54.9 million or 59.9%, from €91.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €146.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA increased by €57.2 million, or 33.6%, from €170.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the organic growth, associated with less than proportional operating cost increases, primarily due to effective control over personnel and other non-personnel expenses. For further details, see the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA presented under “Summary historical financial information and other data—Other financial and pro forma data.” Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 40.0% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our Adjusted EBITDA would have increased by €27.6 million or 13.8%, from €199.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €227.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contains various conditions that must be satisfied in order for the lenders thereunder to make loans available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of certain financing arrangements—Revolving Credit Facility Agreement.” Cash flows from our financing activities have in the past included, among others, proceeds from the Existing Notes and the Revolving ----- Credit Facility. Historically, our principal uses of cash have been, and we expect that our principal uses of cash following the consummation of the Transactions will be, to fund capital expenditures, provide working capital, meet debt service requirements, fund acquisitions, purchase of non-controlling shares, pay earn outs and exercise certain put and call options from time to time pursuant to the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries. On or about the Issue Date, we expect to upsize the Revolving Credit Facility from €180.0 million to €300.0 million, hence further enhancing our liquidity sources. We believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our requirements and commitments for the foreseeable future. However, we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. Our actual financing requirements will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.

For further information, see “Presentation of financial information—Comparability of the Financial Statements.” _Cash flow generated from operating activities_ Our cash flow from operating activities increased by €2.2 million from €176.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €178.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to our organic growth and the effect of a number of bolt-on acquisitions in 2022. In light of the fact that December 31, 2022 was not a business day, the cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was impacted by the postponement of the collections of trade receivables due on December 31, 2022 to January 2023. Without considering such postponement, the increase in cash flow from operating activities from the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2022 would have been higher had the 2021 Acquisition been completed on January 1, 2021, our cash flow from operating activities would have increased by €12.6 million or 7.6%, from €166.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to €178.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our cash flow from operating activities increased by €32.4 million from €178.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to €211.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to our organic growth and the effect of a number of bolt-on acquisitions in 2023. In light of the fact that December 31, 2023 was not a business day, the cash flow from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was impacted by the postponement of the collections of trade receivables due on December 31, 2023 to January 2024. Without considering the postponement of the collections of certain receivables discussed above for the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2023, the increase in cash flow from operating activities from the year ended December 31, 2022 to the year ended December 31, 2023 would have been €32.9 million. Our cash flow from operating activities decreased by €1.8 million from €72.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €70.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to weekend effect, where service renewals falling on a holiday or weekend at month-end result in revenue are recorded in the following month. In light of the fact that March 31, 2024 was not a business day, the cash flow from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was impacted by the postponement of the collections of certain electronic bank receipts due on March 31, 2024 to April 2024. Without considering the postponement of the collections of certain receivables discussed above for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the operating cash flow would have been €98.3 million. ----- _Cash flow from (used in) investing activities_ For the year ended December 31, 2021, our cash flow used in investing activities amounted to €1,947.5 million, reflecting, among other things, €13.1 million of capitalized development costs, €16.6 million of capital expenditures on tangible and intangible assets and €1,917.9 million for equity investments for the acquisition of TeamSystem Group by H&F Fund IX and for the acquisition of Billin, TeamSystem 9 S.r.l., Logical Soft S.r.l., Itacme Informatica S.r.l. and SGS System House S.r.l.

For further information, see “Presentation of financial information—Comparability of the Financial Statements.” Due to the subscription-based nature of most of our contractual arrangements, our net working capital is subject to some extent to seasonality. Net working capital is generally cash generative in the first and second quarter. This is due to the timing of the collection of trade receivables in our Enterprise and Professional business units and, partially, in our Market Specific Solutions business unit. Enterprise and Professional and, to a lesser extent, Market Specific Solutions’ customer invoicing is concentrated at the beginning of the year, when most of the annual fees related to assistance and maintenance contracts and subscription contracts are invoiced. For our contractual arrangements, in our Micro and Cross-Segment Products business unit which mainly consist of subscription contracts, the billing pattern is not as seasonal, given customers generally pay upfront the subscription fees at the subscription date and are therefore normally spread throughout the year. Contracts with VARs also generate more frequent cash inflows as they are usually invoiced on a quarterly basis and the related receivables are collected in approximately three months. Accordingly, our net working capital needs are high in the first quarter, reaching their peak during the first quarter (before we start collecting receivables from our Enterprise and Professional business units) and gradually decreasing through the end of the year. Deferred income, included in “Other current liabilities,” has the same seasonality as the invoicing of sales, with an inverse correlation to trade receivables (i.e. it is amortized on a straight-line basis through the end of the year). As a result of the seasonality of our net working capital, we plan for fixed capital expenditures for employee salaries and VAT payments, which are due monthly and, with respect to VAT, at the time the invoice is raised (despite the delay in customer payment). Net working capital decreased by €2.9 million from negative €30.3 million as of December 31, 2021 to negative €33.2 million as of December 31, 2022, mainly due to a €20.9 million increase in other current liabilities, primarily ----- as a result of a €16.6 million increase in our deferred revenues (which mainly relate to the portion of revenue for software subscriptions attributable to future financial years, based upon the duration of the underlying contracts), which was only partially offset by a €22.1 million increase in trade receivables. This change in net working capital was also impacted by the fact that December 31, 2022 was not a business day and therefore the collection of receivables due on December 31, 2022 was delayed to January 2023. Without this effect, we estimate that the net working capital as of December 31, 2022 would have been considerably negative and, consequently, the decrease compared to December 31, 2021 would have been considerable. Net working capital increased by €13.3 million from negative €33.2 million as of December 31, 2022 to negative €19.9 million as of December 31, 2023, mainly due to a €53.8 million increase in trade receivables and a €25.2 million increase in other receivables, which was only partially offset by a €62.4 million increase in other current liabilities. This change in net working capital was also impacted by the fact that December 31, 2023 was not a business day and therefore the collection of receivables due on December 31, 2023 was delayed to January 2024. Without this effect, we estimate that the net working capital as of December 31, 2023 would have been negative €28.3 million and, consequently, the decrease compared to December 31, 2022 would have been equal to €12.8 million. Net working capital decreased by €10.6 million from negative €19.9 million as of December 31, 2023 to negative €30.5 million as of March 31, 2024, mainly due to a €226.1 million increase in other current liabilities (almost entirely attributable to an increase in our deferred revenues, which mainly related to the portion of revenue for software subscriptions attributable to future financial years, based upon the duration of the underlying contracts) and a €13.3 million decrease in other receivables, which was only partially offset by a €229.0 million increase in trade receivables.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The table above does not include guarantee obligations in the ordinary course of business or contingent liabilities. See “—Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries” below. _Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries_ Our agreements with the non-controlling shareholders of our majority-owned subsidiaries normally provide for put and call option arrangements on the non-controlling stake which give our partners the right to cause us to purchase the non-controlling interest within predetermined periods, as well as for certain earn-out arrangements or other types of deferred consideration based on the performance of such businesses. We define our overall liability with respect to such put and call option and earn-out arrangements relating to non-controlling holdings of the Group as, collectively, the “Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries”. The Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries reflect our estimate of discounted future disbursements in connection with such options and earn-out arrangements, based on the applicable contractual provisions. The strike price of the put and call options is determined based on normalized earnings parameters of the relevant companies plus or minus the net financial position for the period in which the put or call option will be exercised. The discount rate applied for the measurement of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries as of any given date is the cost of debt for the Group (gross of the tax effect) that is adopted for the performance of Group impairment tests, as the cost of this debt is considered to be representative of the Group’s credit risk as of such date. The value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries is subject to change over time as the exercise price of each put and call option and earn out arrangement is dependent on, among other things, the performance of the relevant company in a given future period, which could differ from the performance that we estimate when determining the value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries for accounting purposes. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries, due to both timing and possible changes in estimated indicators that form the basis for the computation of the consideration, are recognized in our consolidated statement of profit or loss, as is the case for the notional charges deriving from the gradual decrease of the effect of discounting. The discounted value of our Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries as of March 31, 2024, which is presented in our Unaudited Interim Financial Statements and in other sections of this Offering Memorandum, was €189.2 million (on a discounted basis) or €206.0 million (on a non-discounted basis). ----- See also “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Certain of our subsidiaries have non controlling _shareholders whose interests may differ from our interests.

This exposure relates almost exclusively to trade receivables deriving from the sale of products and services. We consider our credit risk to be low given the high fragmentation of the customer base and the high degree of customer loyalty. We also use procedures to limit overdue balances and send customers reminders when balances are due. Our maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of trade receivables as presented in our financial statements, as well as cash and residual financial receivables recorded in current and non-current financial assets. As of March 31, 2024, we did not have any insurance cover for trade receivables. We use an aging list in order to classify and control our trade receivables and we organize the aging list according to most recent overdue accounts (0-30 days) to oldest (over 180 days). With respect to overdue receivables, any write-down recorded in our financial statements is determined based on an analysis of doubtful debts, plus a general allowance to take account of further expected losses on balances not yet overdue (taking into account the requirements of the new IFRS 9). Our credit collection performance has historically been successful and losses incurred in the past have been relatively modest. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, our allowance for bad debts was €3.8 million (or 0.9% of our total revenue), €5.5 million (or 1.0% of our total revenue), €7.0 million (or 1.0% of our total revenue), €1.6 million (or 1.0% of our total revenue) and €1.9 million (or 0.9% of our total revenue), respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In particular, the two main factors that determine the dynamics of our liquidity are, on one hand, the resources generated/absorbed by operating and investment activities and, on the other hand, the maturity and renewal of financial liabilities. Our liquidity risk has historically been managed at a central level by our finance department. We have put in place certain procedures aimed at optimizing cash flow management and reducing the liquidity risk, including: ----- - the maintenance of an adequate level of available liquidity; - the adoption of cash-pooling at the central level; - the obtainment of adequate borrowing facilities being put in place; and - the control of prospective liquidity conditions, in relation to the corporate planning process.

To be considered a business, an acquired set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Acquired subsidiaries are accounted for in accordance with the acquisition method as provided for by IFRS 3. The cost of the acquisition is determined by the sum of acquisition-date fair values of the consideration transferred, assets acquired, liabilities incurred or assumed and financial instruments issued by the Group for the change in control of the business acquired. All other costs associated with a transaction are expensed. Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the businesses acquired, which meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, are measured at their acquisition-date current values, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 and which are recorded and measured in accordance with applicable accounting standards. Goodwill is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquiror’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree and the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the value of the acquisition-date amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed exceeds the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest and the fair value of the acquiror’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree, the surplus is recognized immediately in the statement of profit or loss as income arising from the completed transaction. ----- In the event that it is only possible to make a preliminary determination of the fair value of the contingent assets and liabilities at the acquisition date, the business combination shall be recognized using these preliminary amounts. Any adjustments arising from the final determination of the foregoing shall be recognized within twelve months of the acquisition and the related comparatives shall be restated. Non-controlling interests at the acquisition date may be measured at fair value or the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree. The option is available on a transaction by transaction basis. The Group, normally at the same time as the acquisition of majority / controlling stakes in an investee, enters into put and call option agreements for the residual stake held by non-controlling owners of the acquiree. For those cases where part of the acquisition takes place through the execution of a binding option agreement, with the simultaneous presence of put and call clauses, the investee is consolidated, since the substance of the binding option agreement is that of the payment of deferred consideration for part of the investee’s capital, as evidenced by a series of transactions completed in the past. Accordingly, the estimated value of the exercise price of the put / call is included in the cost of acquisition and contributes to the overall determination of goodwill. This accounting method applies only where the Group has acquired majority control of the voting rights of the companies acquired. In view of the recognition of goodwill related to these options, the Group accounts for, as a financial liability, the payable related to the estimated actual consideration for the exercise of the options (i.e. the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries. In accordance with this principle, subsequent changes in the fair value of the payable, due to amendments made to the initial assessment of the exercise consideration, are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss, as is the case for the notional charges deriving from the gradual decrease of the effect of discounting. To note that, in absence of a clear accounting rule for the accounting of non-controlling interests in the case of put and call arrangements, following also the IFRIC and IASB debate, the Group has decided to use the above described method, acceptable under current regulatory framework and positions. Any acquisitions of non-controlling interests subsequent to having achieved control are accounted for as transactions between shareholders, with the pertinent goodwill recorded as a reduction of the Group’s equity, in compliance with the requirements of IFRS 3.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Development costs incurred in relation to a determined project are capitalized only when the Group can demonstrate, by means of appropriate analysis, the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it, how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits, the availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. After initial recognition, development costs are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortization begins when development is complete and the asset is available for use. It is amortized with reference to the period for which it is envisaged that the associated project will generate revenues for the Group. During the period in which an asset is no longer in use, it is assessed annually to ascertain if there has been any impairment. Other development expenses that do not meet the above requirements are expensed as incurred. Development costs that have previously been expensed are not accounted for as an asset in subsequent periods. Capitalized development costs are amortized (as from the start of the production or marketing of the product) on a straight line basis over their residual useful life (estimated to be between 3 and 5 years).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows, as well as the disclosures provided. The actual amounts of the consolidated financial statement components, for which estimates and assumptions have been ----- used, may differ from those reported, due to the uncertainty of assumptions and the conditions on which estimates are based. Set out below is a list of consolidated financial statement components that, more than others, require greater subjectivity, on the part of management, in the application of estimates and, for which, a change in the conditions of underlying assumptions used may have a significant impact on our financial statements: - Business combinations (IFRS 3) and measurement of acquired assets and assumed liabilities: The process of allocation of Goodwill to the assets of the Group following a business combination is based on estimates and assumptions derived from the professional judgement of the management, which may not reflect unforeseeable events. Professional judgement is also used to determine the most appropriate methodologies for measurement of assumed assets and acquired liabilities (including the contingent ones), and, in certain cases, provisional initial accounting has been opted for, as permitted by the accounting standard. In the process of allocating amounts to certain asset items, the Group applied estimates to determine their fair value. To determine fair value, the Group used valuation methods, including discounted cash flow. In order to calculate the present value of future cash flows, it is necessary to make certain assumptions regarding uncertain issues, including management’s expectations regarding (i) the marginality of customer portfolios; (ii) the probability of renewal of customer contracts; and (iii) the selection of the discount rate and growth rate. - Goodwill and other intangible assets: Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment and during the course of the year if there is any indication of impairment throughout the year. Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recovered. When value in use needs to be computed, management estimates the cash flows expected from an asset or from the cash generating unit and chooses an adequate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Accordingly, the impairment test for fixed assets is performed using forecasts, which are naturally subject to uncertainty, included in business plans approved by the relevant board of directors or in projections prepared by management of the Group companies in periods in which the business plan has not been updated for the insights needed to make strategic choices. - Allowance for bad debts: Allowance for bad debts represents the management’s estimate of the losses pertaining to receivables due from end-customers and the sales network. Such estimate is based on losses expected to be incurred, determined on the basis of past experience with similar receivables, on current and historical past due, on losses and payment collection and on careful monitoring of asset quality and forecasts of economic and market conditions. - Provision for risks and charges: These provisions relate to liabilities that are certain or probable, the amount of which has not been determined at the reporting date, but the cost of which, as required to meet the obligation, is capable of being reliably estimated by management. They are recognized in the financial statements in the event of an existing legal or implicit obligation resulting from a prior event and if it is probable that we will be required to meet such obligation. If the impact is significant, the provisions are measured at discounted present value. - Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries: The estimated liability with respect to put and call options or earn-out agreements relating to non-controlling holdings in the Group. It is accounted for at its estimated fair value, having applied various assumptions regarding the estimated indicators that form the basis for its computation and the expected timing of disbursements. The nominal value of the exercise price of the liability to non-controlling shareholders is then discounted at the reporting date by applying the relevant discount rate, which is the same as that adopted for the cost of debt component in impairment tests.

We have an extensive integrated suite of cloud solutions that address the different needs of our customer base and enables us to cross-sell and up-sell our solutions effectively as our customers request incremental features / more advanced configuration beyond basic invoicing and accounting modules. Our core solution is ERP and FMS, which comprises at the core accounting, financial management, asset management, human capital management, production and supply chain management, administration and invoicing management and customer relationship management, can be horizontal or vertical (e.g. in Micro/Small we have solutions for retail, or wellness, in MidMarket we have solutions for construction or manufacturing (CAM, CAD), in Professional we have solutions for Accountants, legal and CAF. From a reporting perspective, the vertical solutions covering Mid-Market and Professionals are included separately in _Market Specific Solutions (“MSS”) Business Unit). In addition, to all three customer segments we offer e-invoicing solutions, as well as Cross Segment Products, which includes: payments, financing and ratings (Digital Finance, “DIF”), CRM, E-commerce and marketing automation (“Extended **CRM”) included for reporting purposes within** _Micro Business Unit, payroll & HCM (“HR”) including Welfare solutions and digital identity and e-signature (“Trust Services”). ERP software solutions represent a company’s core “system of record” for transactions, employee data and other enterprise records. The basic concepts and functionalities of ERP software products typically cover all the main business processes, such as enterprise asset management, accounting and financial management, sales/customers and supply chain management, human capital management, and manufacturing and operations. For professionals, ERP software solutions are mission critical tools through which they offer accounting and payroll services to customers, in addition to managing internal processes. We have developed our platform of solutions via both internal R&D and M&A. For example, to broaden our HR product offering, we acquired Skylab, Microntel and Beneficy to offer an “all-in-one” solution for human resources, which we integrated with our HR payroll and HR administration solutions, allowing our customers to manage employees’ recruiting, careers, performance management, careers, development plans, benefits, training and health and safety. To enhance our E-commerce and CRM proposition, we acquired Storeden and the MailUp email and marketing suite (including ContactLab – a customer data and marketing loud, and Acumbamail, a Spanish email marketing and text messaging send-out platform). To build a customer-centric ecosystem of financial value-added services we acquired ModeFinance, a Rating Agency certified by ESMA. We offer our solutions both on cloud (Software as a Service (“SaaS”) / Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”)) and on premises. Our core markets are Italy, Spain and Turkey. We entered Spain in 2020, and further consolidated our position in 2023 through the acquisition of Acumbamail and Aplifisa. We entered the Turkish market in 2023 by acquiring MikroGrup, a leading local player. We have effectively been able to expand our serviceable addressable market (“SAM”) over time, growing it from approximately €1.1 billion in 2016, to approximately €5.8 billion in 2023.

We believe there is still a significant whitespace, as shown by the difference between SAM and TAM driven by (i) expansion of the product offering and (ii) increased customer reach (for example client segments currently not covered or not served with a specific proposition). Our reference segments today are larger and more diversified than they were in the past, both geographically and product wise, which also makes them less correlated to macro-economic downturns.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.70,Regulatory driven adoption,17.70.1,,"Regulation in Italy continues to play an active role in sustaining our addressable market growth. Regulatory complexity, frequent regulation changes, the digitalization of Public Administration and government subsidies to incentivize digitalization in Italy are all key market growth drivers. Regulation complexity and frequent changes demand for constantly updated management software, which creates both high entry barriers to the Italian market but also positive tailwinds for us, as we can continue servicing our clients’ needs by providing products and updates to help them ensure regulatory compliance. - Framework complexity: Regulatory frameworks across tax, accounting, and payroll requirements are highly complex in Italy. For example, from a tax perspective, there is an objective complexity of fiscal and administrative requirements (e.g. the tax return form has more fields in comparison to the UK equivalent form). From a payroll perspective, Italy is ranked the fourth most complex country for payroll in Alight’s 2023 Global Complexity index. The country’s complexity is driven by court-ordered deductions, the type of mandatory reporting required and the frequency of reporting to the government. This complexity results in a requirement for highly localized software which is capable of interfacing with government protocol. - Frequent regulatory changes: Beyond the complexity of the system, substantial regulatory changes are also very frequent in Italy. Compared with other European countries, Italy has seen the most frequent changes to tax regulation, with more than 110 changes over the past three years: ----- _Source: European Commission._ Digitalization of the Public Administration and subsidies can create direct and indirect positive impacts in incentivizing adoption of digital tools and helping to close the digital gap. - Public Administration digitalization: Recent effort to digitalize Public Administration (“PA”) to improve PA-enterprises efficiency and cut PA costs in Italy. This has incentivized the adoption of digital tools and software among public bodies to streamline and improve the procurement of supplies and services work. - Subsidies: Subsidies introduced over the past few years to incentivize digitalization in Italy (e.g. Industria 4.0, PNRR) further foster the demand for software in Italy. Italy has taken several initiatives to stimulate digitization. For example, The National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR – with an approximate €40 billion budget dedicated to digitalization projects across the public sector) has provided a significant boost by directing investment toward the digitization of SMEs. We expect European regulation related to ESG and non-financial reporting to also play an increasing role in the market evolution. ESG software is designed to solve for the complexities associated with ESG compliance (from ESG data collection, to ESG risk management and ESG reporting). Regulation is evolving and becoming increasingly prescriptive, and companies are forced to navigate different rules and frameworks. Crucially, the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) should be made effective in July 2024 and will require the disclosure of standardized ESG topics by more than 50,000 companies in the EU. While the CSRD’s scope is initially limited to larger enterprises, it is important to note that implementation across SMBs will occur via a phased approach after July 2024, and many SMBs are nonetheless already indirectly impacted today and required to comply with the regulation. A first example of this indirect impact is that large enterprises are called to report on the sustainability of their supply chain. As such, any SMB in the ecosystem of a larger enterprise is expected to be impacted as their customers (the larger enterprise) will require the SMBs in their supply chain to report according to sustainability metrics, which they can in turn report on. Furthermore, all enterprises, including SMBs, competing for any government request for proposal (“RfP”) and contract are also evermore required to report certain ESG metrics, and being able to provide the required ESG questionnaires is becoming mandatory to win the contracts, thus forcing all enterprises who do business with the government to adopt ESG reporting tools too. Additionally, we believe that beyond regulatory-driven adoption, enterprises of all sizes are increasingly incentivized to adopt ESG reporting (and therefore ESG software) because it drives operational improvements, in the form of improved access to financing, and to better customer demand. From a financing perspective, sustainable companies have access to more financing options such as sustainability-linked loans and bonds. Moreover, they have access to better financing options, as banks are introducing more sophisticated ESG disclosure requirements in financing processes. From a customer demand perspective, customers are increasingly ----- demanding more sophisticated corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) policies, and multiple market studies show that there is a performance gap between companies which implement CSR policies and those who do not, as consumers and companies are more likely to buy from the former, rather than the latter. ESG reporting requirements are therefore expected to play an increasing role in the SMB market and drive demand for ESG software solutions that support companies in meeting compliance requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Italy appears to be lagging behind other European Countries in terms of Digitalization more generally, ranking below the EU average in the DESI 2022 index. That said, the DESI index is an aggregation of countries’ ranking across various dimensions, namely: Human Capital, Connectivity, Integration of Digital Technology, and Digital Public Services dimension. Crucially, however, the Integration of Digital Technology dimension is the most relevant to our market of operation. The Integration of Digital Technology dimension aims to capture the use of technology by Enterprises, analyzing, amongst other indicators, (i) the use of Cloud services and (ii) the proportion of SMEs with at least a basic level of digital intensity. Under this lens, Italy performs well in comparison to other European countries. Italy performs well in the uptake of cloud services, with approximately 50% of enterprises using this technology (well above the EU average of 34%). Unlike other Mediterranean countries, Italy’s penetration rates for cloud services more closely resemble Nordic and Benelux economies, the latter having historically been far more advanced in terms of digitalization. Both business to government (“B2G”) and business to business (“B2B”) einvoicing is compulsory in Italy, and this has contributed significantly to the adoption of cloud accounting, especially in the low end of the market where companies have adopted cloud native solutions. However, a sizeable opportunity remains as the lower end of the market is still rather underpenetrated in terms of overall ERP adoption, and on the other hand the higher end of the market is continuing its transition to the cloud. _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI); 2023 Indicators, data from 2021. (1) At least one of the following: finance or accounting software applications; enterprise resource planning (ERP) software applications; customer relationship management (CRM) software applications; security software applications; hosting the enterprise’s database(s); computing platform providing a hosted environment for application development, testing or deployment._ Furthermore, approximately 70% of SMEs in Italy have at least a basic level of digital intensity, just above the EU average of 69%, and well above other Mediterranean countries such as France and Spain. As detailed below, progress in digitalization in Italy is especially pronounced in the use of e-invoices, where Italy outperforms the European average, being one of the first country to make e-invoices mandatory for all companies (regardless of company size). ----- _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI) 2023 Indicators, data from 2022.

In terms of software adoption by company size, while the adoption of solutions for e-invoicing is very high (97%+ across the board) given the introduction of mandatory e-invoicing in Italy, the adoption of more advanced software solutions in Italy diverges by company size. _Source: Istat report imprese 2023._ - Small businesses (10-49 employees): while 97% utilize an e-invoicing software, only 39% have an ERP software and only 17% utilize a CRM software. Continued digitalization and ERP adoption is driven by shifts and transformation of SME operating models that require more advanced instruments to attract and retain customers, manage the rapid growth in online demand, streamline key processes (for example tax, accounting, bookkeeping, invoicing, budgeting, estimates, inventories, POS, accounting, etc.) via digital platform, increase productivity and adapt to work from home (“WFH”) arrangements with access to collaboration tools. ----- - Mid-market (50-249 employees): the mid-market benefits from higher percentages of ERP adoption (61% for 50-99 employees and 72% for 100-249 employees), however i) the adoption of more advanced modules is still low (e.g. for CRM: 26% for 50-99 employees and 36% for 100-249 employees, for business intelligence: 33% for 50-99 employees and 46% for 100-249 employees), which means there is expected to be more space to cross-sell additional modules, and ii) existing solutions tend to be outdated, so there is an upgrade cycle which is expected to take place and will likely be done via cloud solutions. Demand for additional modules is expected to be driven by the increasing need of companies of digitize and automatize operations and embed data and AI within their operating model.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Cloud-based solutions represent a significant change in how software companies are bringing their solutions to market and have the potential to significantly impact the operation of companies’ IT infrastructures. In particular, cloud-based solutions allow smaller companies to benefit from sophisticated applications that have traditionally been utilized only by larger organizations, as historically, the implementation cost and the level of IT support required to run on premise applications efficiently prevented smaller companies from using sophisticated software. Cloud-based solutions can therefore reduce such barriers to usage, enable software houses to develop more easy-to-use solutions and allow an increasing number of businesses to streamline and simplify their IT ----- infrastructures and application deployment, also allowing micro and small businesses to purchase and utilize simple ERP solutions targeted to their needs.

The slower adoption rate of ERP systems is due to the mission-critical nature of ERP as well as the increased need for customization versus CRM and HCM systems.

Cybersecurity is a global risk which impacts all industries. The frequency of cyber attacks has increased significantly in recent years, as such the demand for software solutions is growing. 2022 saw 21.5% more cases of cyber security attacks globally in comparison to 2021 (Source: Rapporto Clusit 2023). The issue is particularly strong in Italy: on a national level, Italy is the fourth country by number of attacks, behind the US, Germany, and France (Source: ENISA Threat Landscape for Ransomware Attacks, 2022), and Italy saw approximately 170% more cases of cyber attacks in 2022 than 2021 (in comparison to the global average of 21.5%). Cyber attacks are generally costly for companies to incur, yet are from our perspective often easily avoidable. We believe that approximately 90% of attacks are a result of human error due to lack of adequate technology training. As current SMB adoption of cybersecurity software is very low, and, given the ubiquitous threat level, demand for simple software solutions is on the rise. We thus believe there remains a big market opportunity to reduce cyber risks and attacks for SMBs. We believe the EU Cybersecurity SMB software TAM to be worth approximately €12 billion (as of 2022). Supported by the increase in attacks, and the SMB demand for cybersecurity software products, the EU cybersecurity SMB TAM market is expected to grow 12% between 2022 and 2024 (Source: Management).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.74,Emerging Technology – Generative AI,17.74.1,Overview of the Spanish Market,"We believe that, similarly to Italy, growth in the Spanish ERP sector is also driven by regulatory changes, increasing digitalization and transition to cloud. _Regulatory driven adoption_ Regulation in Spain plays an active role in sustaining our addressable market dynamics. Regulatory changes, such as grants and subsidies, tax level changes, accounting software standard enforcement, and e-invoicing are expected to have a positive impact on the ERP sector in Spain. - Digitalization grants: There have been continued efforts to improve enterprises’ digitalization in Spain – the country has made strong progress on the integration of digital technology front. Spain has launched: 1) the Kit Digital initiative (budget: €3 billion) to promote scalable, high-impact, and publicprivate collaboration mechanisms to accelerate the digitalization of SMEs (with a focus on microenterprises) and the self-employed; and 2) the Agents of Change programme (budget: €300 million), ----- which aims to provide SMEs with grants to hire digital transformation experts. These governmental initiatives foster the implementation and development of digital transformation solutions and as a result, we expect these to boost the growth of the ERP sector. - Tax level changes: Ongoing political debates surrounding tax rate changes may result in beneficial market trends, and any resulting changes to tax rates could increase complexity of the fiscal system and processes. Increased complexity could increase the demand for deep and local market expertise, as well as for accounting software solutions. - Accounting software standards enforcement: the multitude of recent data breach incidents may result in higher standards for accounting software’s protection of user data and privacy. Enforcement of stricter standards could drive demand for continued software upgrades, supporting market dynamics and growth. - Mandatory e-invoicing: a shift from voluntary to mandatory e-invoicing could be a key growth driver in the Spanish ERP sector, increasing demand for Software accounting solutions. B2B e-invoicing is expected to be made mandatory for small and micro-enterprises in 2026, and in July 2024 for those with turnover exceeding €8 million. _Enterprise digitalization & Cloud_ SMEs are particularly relevant in Spain, where almost 2.7 million SMEs (over 99.9% of the total) contributed 58% of total value added (€288 billion) and employed 8.5 million people (68% of the total workforce) in 2020 (Source: DESI 2023 & Eurostat). However, SME digitalization appears to be slightly below the EU average, with Spain registering 67.5% of SMEs with at least a basic level of digital intensity, in comparison to the European average of 69% (as detailed in the DESI chart above). The Spanish government is continuing to invest to improve enterprises’ digitalization levels in Spain, where there remains ample growth opportunities. Reforms and investments to improve scalability and digitalization of SMEs may not only have a direct effect on SMEs’ basic and advanced digitalization but may also have an indirect multiplier impact on other dimensions and targets (e.g. the number and quality of ICT specialists, infrastructure, and digital public services) and the overall Spanish economy. The share of SMEs with at least a basic level of digital intensity remains just below the EU average, and there remains ample opportunity for growth. Spain is currently also implementing several measures to increase the number of enterprises taking up cloud computing as Spain currently lags the European average for adoption of cloud computing amongst enterprises, with Spain at 27% of enterprises with cloud computing services of sophisticated or intermediate level in contrast to the European average of 34% (as detailed in the DESI chart above). In 2022, under Spain’s RRP, the country launched the UNICO I+D Cloud programme, which provides grants to support innovative cloud computing projects in public research centers and foundations as well as public universities. In the context of the IPCEI on Next Generation Cloud Infrastructure and Services, Spain is expected to actively contribute to increasing cloud uptake among businesses and to investing in new green-cloud infrastructure models (i.e. introducing sustainable operating models, de-carbonized with the use of natural refrigerants). While current cloud technology uptake is low in Spain, we believe there is opportunity for growth, as well as tangible initiatives to drive acceleration. We believe a key driver of growth in Spain over the next few years will be: - Strong upsell and cross-sell with average revenue per customer increasing approximately 7% per annum in Spain; and - Accelerating shift to cloud-based services, with penetration growing significantly across segments including accountants and small and mid-sized companies in Spain (growing from 20% to 30% to >60% cloud penetration). Cloud adoption for the Spain SME market over next few years is forecasted to move from approximately 30% today to approximately 60% in 2026 based on our internal analysis; cloud penetration growth in small and medium companies expected to come from new software users: - 75% of new small companies estimated to adopt cloud solutions, due to broad offer of entry-level solutions available with competitive prices. ----- - For new mid-sized companies, only 50% assumed to adopt cloud solutions, as most expected to be growing from smaller sizes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

A current government focus is establishing online systems for real-time tracking and auditing (“e-txn”). A selection of key initiatives which aim to address the grey market through increasing digitalization and monitoring, and in turn should sustain the growth of the Turkish ERP sector (as more businesses are digitalized), is listed below (all with expected completion before 2025). - E-Integration: Track cash transactions of produce sellers by integrating agriculture reporting organisations with e-systems (e.g., e-Ledger, e-Archive, etc.). - Salary payments: Expand capabilities and laws mandating business owners to pay their employees through online banking. - Ledger database: Building online system to have all business ledgers (including inventory tracking) recorded in an online database. - Invoice tracking: Make the use of the Centralized Invoice Registration System more widespread to ensure debt is used in accordance with the nature of financing. - Digital payments: Implement measures to promote widespread use of digital payment methods such as bank or credit cards, as well as other payment options, instead of cash. - Limit cash use: Implement regulations (preventative and incentive) to reduce the grey market in activities where cash is heavily used, specifically in the service sector. - Remote work: Develop regulations and business codes for remote, hybrid, and shared-office business owners to accurately track their activities. - Auditing: Enhance effectiveness of control and auditing activities carried out by government tax offices by developing a pre-audit and analysis system. Current regulations require companies with a turnover greater than 3 million Turkish Lira to comply with einvoicing regulations, the inflationary environment in Turkey however is expected to result in a larger number of companies falling within the e-invoicing threshold. The Turkish market is then expected to naturally increase by 25% year-on-year as inflation will force an increasing number of companies to adopt e-invoicing. Indeed, as of December 2022, 800,000 companies fell within the threshold and the inflationary environment is expected to impact approximately 1.1 to 1.2 million additional micro companies by 2027 (Internal analysis). _Enterprise digitalization & Cloud_ SMEs play an important role in Turkey, with almost 3.8 million SMEs (over 99.7% of the total number of companies) employing approximately 71% of the total workforce and accounting for 42.5% of total turnover (Source: TurkStat, 2022). As such, SMEs can play a large role in driving the digitalization process in Turkey. The government has been driving digitalization across SMEs in Turkey with various initiatives, of note, the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation (TURKONFED) has initiated the “Digital Transformation Center” project which is a part of Istanbul Development Agency’s (IDA) 2018 Innovative and Creative Istanbul Financial Support Program, an institution working in coordination with the Ministry of Industry and Technology of Turkey. The project (with a 3 million Turkish Lira budget) is aimed to help SMEs with digital transformation and increase their global competitiveness capacity, also further sustaining Istanbul’s broader innovation ecosystem. We expect the digitalization initiatives mentioned above and the e-invoicing expansion drive ERP uptake too. According to our estimates, as of 2023, ERP penetration in Turkey is only approximately 14% (number of ----- companies with ERP on total stock of companies in Turkey). We believe the expansion of e-invoicing compliance is also likely to drive ERP penetration, with aggregate market penetration improving two-fold (i.e., 11% to over 23%) by 2027. According to the Turkish Institute of Statistics (TurkStat), while Turkish enterprises (50-249 employees) still lag the European average for use of Cloud computing services (27% for Turkey in 2023 in comparison to 34% European average per DESI), the uptake of cloud computing services amongst enterprises has been on the rise in Turkey and there remains a vast opportunity for further growth as detailed in the chart below. _Source: TurkStat, Survey on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Usage in Enterprises, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2023._",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Our Micro BU has become an increasingly important part of our business, representing €182 million of 2023 revenues (25% total 2023 revenues), and growing 34% from 2021 to 2023. In 2022, the Italian SMEs and micro and small businesses customer segment comprised approximately 4.7 million companies, each employing less than 250 employees. Of these companies, approximately 207,000 (4% of total) were small (10 to 49 employees) and 26,000 (1% of total) were medium sized (50 to 250 employees) (SMEs). The remaining 4.4 million (95% of total) companies were categorized as micro and small businesses, with less than 10 employees (source: ISTAT). Compared to other Western European countries, SMEs and micro and small businesses represent a large customer segment of the domestic customer market in Italy (approximately 100% of the total 4.7 million companies and approximately 77% of employment) (source: ISTAT). In 2022, Italy was one of countries with the largest SME and micro and small businesses sectors in Europe, compared to approximately 4.2 million companies in France (Source: OECD), approximately 2.9 million companies in Spain (Source: Ministerio de Industria y Turismo) and approximately 5.5 million companies in the United Kingdom (Source: GOV UK). We believe SMEs and micro and small businesses play a major role in global economic growth, particularly for Italy. ----- _Source: ISTAT._ Our micro and small segment has benefitted from mandatory B2B and B2G e-invoicing regulation, which prompts widespread adoption of e-invoicing solutions across all company sizes (over 97% of Italian SMEs adopt einvoicing solutions in comparison to the 39% UE27 average – Source: ISTAT). Italy became the first country in Europe which mandated e-invoicing, with the objective to combat tax fraud and tax evasion, and thus increasing the efficiency of the fiscal system. Since 2015, B2G e-invoicing has been mandatory in Italy. This is consistent with many other European countries which have introduced mandatory B2G invoicing. In 2019, mandatory B2B and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) e-invoicing was also introduced. The invoices must be in the FatturaPA format and are transmitted via the Sistema di interscambio. There was originally an exemption for businesses with turnover below €65,000, which as of January 2024 was removed, thus becoming applicable for all businesses. Adoption of mandatory e-invoicing regulation has been varied across Europe, with France only making B2G e-invoicing mandatory since 2020, while B2B invoicing currently remains voluntary, with an envisioned staged implementation. Currently it is envisioned that LME invoicing will be made mandatory by September 2026, and SMEs and micro businesses e-invoicing will be made mandatory by the third quarter of 2027. In Spain, B2G e-invoicing has been mandatory since 2015, albeit only for transactions above €5,000. B2B e-invoicing in Spain currently remains voluntary, it is envisioned that the first phase will begin being implemented in 2025 (Source: European Commission). The Sistema di interscambio processes over 2 billion B2B e-invoicing per year. The mandatory e-invoicing is helping achieve important goals in tackling VAT evasion and simplification of administrative and fiscal processes and boosted the growth of the market of services. The Revenue Agency has made available free services to support the onboarding process of SMEs and to facilitate the process of transmission and archiving of e-invoicing. The Revenue Agency developed a dedicated smartphone application, which allows SMEs to create and transmit einvoicing (Source: European Commission). While a free e-invoicing solution from the Revenue Agency exists, we observe that this is used primarily by costconscious micro businesses that do not issue a high number of invoices (below approximately 20 to 40 invoices per month). A lot of micro businesses and partite IVA (a self-employed worker or owner of a company) still benefit from our e-invoicing solution, even if it includes only some basic modules (e.g. a basic e-invoicing and dashboard) as it represents a cost effective solution (approximately €200 per annum) to keep their finances handy and effectively share data with their accountant. We believe the below to be key drivers of growth in this segment. 1. Ongoing digitalization, ERP uptake and cross-selling: as basic needs are met (e.g. e-invoicing), customers discover new modules (bookkeeping / accounting), as well as other features (CRM, HCM). Broader ERP solutions are largely unpenetrated in the smaller end of the market, where amongst small businesses (10-49 employees) 97% utilize an e-invoicing software, but only 39% utilize an ERP software and 17% utilize a CRM software (Source: ISTAT). We estimate that 25% of our customers require additional features on top of basic bookkeeping / accounting (49% look for extended CRM offering, 41% for Digital finance solutions) (Source: management). Given TeamSystem’s leading positioning in the einvoicing space, it is well placed to offer adjacent solutions on top of the more basic functionality. ----- Another element which gives us comfort to believe there is upsell, cross-sell (and pricing) upside is that customer average spend (ARPU) is six times lower than other European countries. 2.

Our Professional business unit, historically our key customer segment, represents €214.8 million of 2023 revenues (29.3% of total 2023 revenues), and growing 33.6% from 2021 to 2023. Such segment consists of professional advisors providing tax, labor and accounting advice to businesses and private individuals, and can be divided into three main customer groups: - Accountants: professional advisors providing tax filing services and tax and accounting advice to businesses and private individuals; - Labor consultants: HR administration and management advisors providing advice and services relating to payroll and HR matters to businesses and professional organizations; and - Law firms: law firms providing legal advice to businesses and private individuals. We believe regular and timely software updates are critical for professional advisors, as ERP and business management software products must constantly be updated to accommodate changes in tax, accounting and labor regulation. The professional customer segment is more highly penetrated than the SME and micro business customer segment and software for fiscal and labor consultants has reached almost the entire active population in ----- Italy, driven by compulsory electronic filing obligations with the Italian tax and pension authorities. In addition, the professional customer segment has historically been resilient to macroeconomic cycles, with companies requiring tax, labor, accounting and financial, and legal advice in periods of downturns as well as growth. We believe that our success factors in this segment include: - Comprehensive suite of product offering for professionals, to cater for their needs and a modular based approach allowing for ease of up-sell and cross-sell; and - Ease of integration with clients’ dashboard and software solution, optimizing the activities of professionals. Having a leading position in SMB and micro businesses has been very beneficial in having a leading position in professionals, and vice versa.

These customers include: - Manufacturing companies that require CAM and CAD solutions. CAM/CAD products are usually deployed to customers with internal engineering and design functions that develop their products internally, and enable customers to design their products and production processes; - Construction companies (including in the public sector) and engineering and design firms that require specific software for construction project management; - Hospitality businesses, tour operators and travel agencies that require specific software solutions; - Gyms, pools, wellness and leisure centers that require specific software solutions; and - CAF (Authorized Fiscal Advisory for Individuals) and public sector entities that require specific software solutions. We believe that our success factors in this segment have been based on our comprehensive set of vertical-specific solutions, which is a key driver for our one-stop shop strategy covering all businesses’ needs. Especially small and mid-size businesses with verticalization requirements do not want to select the individual solutions to cater to their different business needs from an IT perspective, but favour those providers that are able to offer all solutions as one-stop shop.

These solutions include: We believe that our success factors in this segment include: - Compared to other existing standalone solutions across these different software products, we offer our clients a modular platform one-stop shop solution, where they can easily select and add to their existing products any incremental module required. While larger scale enterprise businesses (who generally have an IT department), may want to select different software products from different providers, small and mid-sized customers prefer to buy their software from a single provider, with a modular approach. Additionally, ERP is the system of record for enterprise customers, and given our established position in ERP software, we are strongly positions to sell additional software modules. - In digital finance, some of the success factors of our solution compared to other offerings has been: (i) it allows for a full integration of supply chain and financial value chain offering digital payment and credit solutions, (ii) it is fully integrated into our ERP and FMS software, (iii) it has strong use cases ----- for specific verticals such as real estate (condominiums) and wellness (gyms) and (iv) it has a simple and intuitive interface and modular offering. - In HR, some of the success factors of our solution compared to other offerings have been: (i) our HR solution is a one-stop shop covering all functionalities in one integrated suite (HCM, payroll, BPaaS, welfare), (ii) it is fully integrated into our ERP and FMS software, (iii) we have a strong focus on SMEs compared to international incumbents and other local providers, who are more focused on the upper end of the market (enterprises), (iv) strong local knowledge of local regulation, including specific welfare regulation and (v) direct access to largest customer base in Italy on mid-market and micro businesses to cross-sell solutions (75% of new sales from cross-selling). - In CRM, some of the success factors of our solution compared to other offerings has been: (i) our CRM solution is an extensive modular suite of solutions across the wider CRM spectrum (CRM, e-commerce, marketing automation) which enables customers to pick and choose the solutions they need, (ii) it is fully integrated into our ERP and FMS software and (iii) intuitive interface and UX, deployable autonomously or through TeamSystem internal support. - In Trust services, some of the success factors of our solution compared to other offerings has been: (i) our Trust services are a comprehensive set of e-signature, e-archiving and certified access (SPID) solutions, (ii) it is fully integrated into our ERP and FMS software and (iii) easy integration with external stakeholders, such as Italian regulatory bodies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.76,Mid-market,17.76.4,,"We offer ERP, FMS and our broader product platform of software solutions to mid-market businesses (50-249 employees, but also have some larger customers in this segment). Our Enterprise BU has grown consistently, reaching €164.6 million of 2023 revenues (22.4% of total 2023 revenues). We believe key drivers of growth in this segment include: 1) Regulatory driven adoption: mid-market businesses are also impacted by tax and legal compliance obligations, which are constantly evolving. As a matter of fact, the mid-market and upper end of the market is often the “first adopter” of new regulations, which tend to be first rolled out to larger businesses in the first instance, and to smaller businesses in a second moment. 2) Ongoing digitalization, ERP uptake and cross-selling: the mid-market benefits from higher percentages of ERP adoption (61% for 50-99 employees and 72% for 100-249 employees), however i) the adoption of other modules is comparably low (e.g. for CRM: 26% for 50-99 employees and 36% for 100-249 employees) and ii) existing solutions tend to be outdated, so there is an upgrade cycle which is expected to occur via cloud solutions. ----- _Source: AssoSoftwareResearch Survey 2022 (514 SMEs)._ 1) Cloud: most of ERP software for Italian mid-size businesses is still on-premise. The migration to cloud based services is expected to be a major growth driver over the next few years. Migration to cloud is often done with an uptick in ARPU so-called “uplift” (higher revenue from SaaS subscription compared to replaced maintenance revenues since infrastructure service is offered on top of core application services). We believe that our success factors in this segment include: - Comprehensive suite of product offering for mid-market businesses, to cater for their needs and a modular based approach allowing for ease of up-sell and cross-sell. - Strength across both horizontal and vertical offering, with an extensive portfolio of industry specific solutions to cater to our customers’ needs (without need for extensive integration and customization of products).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.77,Competition,17.77.1,Italy,"_Enterprise ERP and FMS (Micro, Small and Mid-Market)_ We observe that the competitive dynamics within the ERP and FMS solutions market for the micro, small and mid-size customer segment are influenced by a number of key differentiating characteristics, including: - Depth, breadth and quality of offering, including different functionalities as well as vertical specific solutions; - Local presence and local language support; - Scale, allowing for research and development investments to ensure that (i) the underlying legal, tax and accounting content of software is up to date, (ii) new products and functionalities are developed in a timely manner as new regulations are introduced (e.g., e-invoicing) and (iii) product architecture, technology and user experience are constantly updated, in line with most recent innovations; - Brand awareness; - Ability to offer better value for money; and - Substantial local tax and accounting knowledge and ability to quickly adapt to, and take advantage of, evolving local rules mandated by the Italian government to capture new business opportunities. In addition, we believe this segment is characterized by loyal customers and moderate price sensitivity, because: - Customer retention is critical, in particular for SMEs and professionals, who thoughtfully evaluate migrations to alternative suppliers, given (i) the essential role of software and the potential data migration challenges during a transition to a new supplier, (ii) the training required to familiarize employees with new software and (iii) the time and resources needed to switch to a different platform, as ERP systems are integral to various operational processes; and - The degree of price sensitivity can be moderated, as customers often prioritize the quality of services and the availability of customer support. Additionally, after adopting software products, customers rely on suppliers for system maintenance and regular product updates that are essential for the functionality of the software. Customers also depend on software providers for adequate training to ensure employees can effectively use the new software solutions. This multi-level reliance on software providers may help reduce the impact of price sensitivity. ----- _International competitors_ ERP and FMS software solutions offered by large international software providers such as Microsoft, Oracle and SAP are primarily aimed at large businesses and are often expensive to purchase, standardized and less flexible and/or complicated to customize and maintain. In our reference market segments, which are skewed towards smaller businesses (micro, small, and mid-size), these international players currently do not focus on providing ERP and FMS solutions. Historically, they have not prioritized this segment as it would require tailoring their products to the specific needs of smaller businesses and local regulations, which may not align with their broader business models. An important requirement for entry for large international providers is the ability to adapt to constantly evolving local tax and accounting regulations in Italy. For example, some of the large international software providers do not provide some local accounting features in their offering (e.g., depreciation modules), which may have a key role for the customer, thus requiring SMEs to liaise with local ERP providers such as TeamSystem or System Integrators to adapt and make the solution compliant. We believe local ERP software firms offer a more adequate value proposition to their SME and micro and small businesses clientele compared to larger international software providers, by offering a combination of lower prices, dedicated customer support, more flexible industry specific solutions and ongoing regulatory-related updates. Similar issues are also true with regards to international players (such as Xero) who offer cloud solutions for professionals and micro businesses. Hence, these names have a limited presence in Italy and tend to compete on more basic / standardized offerings. _Local competitors_ Our main local ERP competitors include the Zucchetti group, Sistemi, Gruppo WKI and Dylog. We believe that we are well-positioned compared to our local competitors on several key parameters, such as: (i) pricing, in certain customer segments (e.g., SMEs), where the customer perceives our product quality to be similar at more attractive prices (based on the average yearly price per seat for SME software); (ii) offering, where our offering is perceived to be more focused, making it easier for our sales network to sell our products; (iii) our cloud offering, where we are perceived to be ahead on the cloud development roadmap, having an extended SaaS multi-tenant portfolio; (iv) ease of installation, where our products are perceived as being less complex to migrate to; and (v) product innovation, in terms of both on new technologies (AI), and new solutions which result in a clear premium value perception by our customers. _E-invoicing_ Since the introduction of mandatory e-invoicing in Italy, different players have entered the space to offer einvoicing solutions. The e-invoicing space is quite polarized between players that offer low cost very basic solutions (e.g. Aruba, who’s solution only allows the transmission of the XML invoice to the Italian Revenue Agency’s exchange system) and others who offer a more comprehensive package of solutions like us (where additional modules such as dashboarding and accounting and bookkeeping are offered to micro businesses on top of basic e-invoicing functionalities). E-invoicing is a key component of our micro offering. _Professionals_ The professional segment is mature considering its growth is close to zero (e.g. the number of registered accountants has increased at 0.6% CAGR from 2010 to 2022 – Source: Fondazione Nazionale Commercialisti). Our main competitors in this segment include Zucchetti, Sistemi, Dylog and Wolters Kluwers. Key differentiating characteristics for professional ERP providers, are similar to the ERP and FMS sector for SMEs and micro businesses (i.e. depth of offering, local support, local knowledge of regulation, scale to support innovation and update spend). We believe there is also value-add for our customers to have a provider which is able to offer both professional and SMB ERP, as this can facilitate collaboration between the professional and their clients with a dashboard that allows for an integrated management of clients. We believe it is important to be market leader in the professional segment, as accountants are a very important referral channel (60% of our micro and small customers came to us via the accountant channel. We believe there has overall been limited product and technology investments by our competitors in this segment compared to our level of investments (i.e. other real SaaS solutions, limited AI solutions, limited fintech and other advanced digital features) with few selected exceptions (e.g., Zucchetti, WKI). ----- Further highlighting our significant level of investment, and commitment to innovation, we deployed our AI proposition in 2024, and have a clear, pre-defined plan of use cases to be released over the coming 12 months, with the following examples of use cases which we have already deployed: - Automated AI accounting; - Euroconference Co-Pilot (accountants training and learning solutions); and - Generative-AI research box, which allows customers to access content trough a natural language interaction (while also retaining access to traditional research options).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.78,International & Cross-Solutions,17.78.1,Spain,"Our main competitors in the Spanish ERP sector for micro, small and mid-sized businesses are (i) international ERP incumbents tailored to the mid-market and SMB segments, and (ii) local generalist SME solutions. The international ERP incumbents for the mid-market and SMB segments (Wolters Kluwer, Sage, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle Netsuite and SAP Business One) offer simplified and competitive ERP solutions. We believe these solutions offer a limited local vision but are flexible to be tailored to local regulation and business needs. The international players have an advantage in their ability to deliver strong products and integration capabilities with their platform and ecosystem, posing a clear advantage to gain share in the segment. Local generalist SMB ERP solutions (Delsol, Solmicro, and Ibermatica) offer tailored solutions for local specificities, however we believe they have a limited ability to invest in technological development and thus to capture scale benefits. Local players however have strong and sticky relationships with their local customers, consolidating their share in Spain. With regards to the professional market (accountants), we observe the market to be dominated by Wolters Kluwers and Sage. There is a limited presence of other players, mainly consisting of historical names, with no strategic investment made recently in the segment. In 2023, we acquired Aplifisa, a local established software provider specialized in the development of solutions for professionals in the tax and labor sectors, which helped solidify our position and reputation, together with the other strong brands we acquired in Spain (Software del Sol, Billin, Acumbamail). Our applications enjoy a high level of prestige, recognized by clients for their quality, high performance, reliability and safety while being offered at competitive prices on the market. Our strategy in Spain is to replicate the successful approach implemented in Italy, which is centered around leveraging Professionals as a channel to promote and sell our digital solutions to their end customers (SMBs). Professionals have consistently proven to be a very important enabler for us, as they can easily promote our products to their customers, according to their different needs. There are also other local players in Spain catering to SMBs needs, such as vertical-specialized niche solutions and pure digital native solutions (e.g. Quipu, Holded – albeit both have been acquired by larger players, Sellsy and Visma respectively), though we believe these present a limited threat to TeamSystem given generally low awareness, limited customer base, and lack of generalist expertise and full-suite offering. We estimate our overall share to be approximately 4% based on our 2023 revenues and our estimate of 2023 Spanish market size (Spanish 2023 SAM: €726 million). Our share has grown from less than 2% in 2020 (based on a Spanish 2020 SAM of €613 million), thanks to strong organic and inorganic growth. _Micro_ We believe we have a strong position in Spain in the micro business segment which has historically been less of a focus for the larger players in Spain. Our strong position in the micro businesses in Spain is further bolstered by our extensive experience in the micro market in Italy – we have successfully exported both our know-how and products to Spain. Furthermore, our strong relationships with accountant customers in Spain are a further growth enabler in the micro segment. Our product is well-recognized amongst accountant customers in Spain, which in turn can encourage their clients to adopt our solutions for streamlined accounting management, expanding our reach and impact within the micro segment. ----- _Enterprise (Small (10-49 employees) and mid-size (50-499 employees))_ The Spanish ERP sector for small enterprises is more fragmented than other segments, with a long tail of solutions which represent approximately 50% of the share. The mid-size market instead is concentrated around key players, such as Sage, SAP, Microsoft, and Wolters Kluwer which control approximately 50% of the share. Notably, Oracle has been gaining presence in the market. _Professionals_ The Spanish market is consolidated and dominated by specialist players such as Wolters Kluwer and Sage. Other players have a limited presence, and mainly cover historical clients given lack of recent strategic investments in the segment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The rest of the space is represented by small brands. Logo has traditionally been more focused on large SMEs and enterprises, whereas Mikro is stronger on small-mid SMEs. In the micro segment, Mirko (Paraşüt) is very well positioned as a leading player with strong customer perception. Mikro’s position is driven by its first mover advantage and strong CPA relationships and recommendations. The accountant segment is constituted of approximately 58,000 independent CPAs. We observe customer loyalty to be high, leading to low churn and relative difficulty in capturing share from competitors, that said, Mikro has managed to increase market penetration above 30% in recent years. CPAs, differently from Italy, are not allowed ----- to perform e-invoice transactions on behalf of their customers by law, hence transaction revenues are limited to e-ledger only in CPA segment. We estimate our overall share to be approximately 14% based on 2023 revenues and 2023 Turkish market size (Turkish 2023E SAM: €265 million). Of note, our Micro share is approximately 30% (as of June 2024 per Management analysis). We estimate to have more than 30% share on the professionals (accountancy) segment (Source: Management analysis). _Micro and Small_ In SME segment, Logo is the leading player followed by Mikro (owned by TeamSystem), with a fragmented long tail of competition. SME segment is highly stable with low churn rates, keeping companies’ positions intact. The user perception of Logo and Mikro are similar with very little differentiation across two. Furthermore, Mikro is gaining traction against the competition via its subscriber model. In the micro segment, Mikro (Paraşüt product) is well positioned as a leading player with stronger customer perception. Paraşüt’s position is driven by its first mover advantage and strong CPA recommendations. _Professionals_ In the CPA segment, Luca appears to be the most common CPA software with estimated adoption rate of 50% to 55%, followed by Mikro (Zirve product) with 40% adoption among 55k CPA market. Luca’s leading position is driven by its connection to TURMOB (CPA association) and considerably low pricing point vs Zirve. Luca and Zirve appear to have similar functionality, whereas Luca has the advantage of being web based. Recent growth indicators show similar growth rate for both solutions, hence, the position of the two leading players appears to be stable. A significant portion of CPAs own multiple softwares, hence, there are exist an overlap between Luca and Zirve users in the professional sector.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.79,HR & Payroll,17.79.1,,"Offering payroll software solutions requires providers to be familiar with local language, labor regulations, market customs, and obtain necessary local and national accreditations. The lower end of the payroll market tends to be nearly fully outsourced to payroll professionals, as SMEs and micro businesess do not have the in-house knowledge to process the payslips and prefer to have an expert help them given the high complexity and high likelihood of mistakes. As customers grow in size, they tend to insource the payroll function again. As a result, payroll providers tend to offer either solutions for professionals, catering to smaller businesses, or solutions for enterprises catering to larger businesses. We believe we are market leaders in the former (payroll for professionals), but less dominant on the overall market (payroll for enterprises and professionals), where Zucchetti is market leader. We believe our payroll offering is differentiated by a high quality, well-priced offering. In addition, we also offer payroll processing services for some customers who want to outsource some of their payroll processing. We leverage AI and technology to reduce manual work needed and automatize the process to be able to offer this service at attractive price to our customers and with attractive margins for us. In Italy, there are a few international payroll providers (software and services) more skewed towards enterprise (e.g. ADP, SAP on the enterprise side; Workday does not have a payroll solution in Italy, although they are present with their HCM offering) and a few local Payroll providers (F2A on upper end of enterprise market, Zucchetti, WK, Inaz and others on the small and mid-size market). On HCM (employee records, talent management, time and attendance, etc.) instead, the offering is more standard, and it is less complex for providers to offer similar packages in different geographies. We perceive our value-add to be the ability to offer additional HCM modules, on top of an established payroll solution. We are strongly positioned with our established payroll solution, as we already largely control the customer’s payroll (which for smaller businesses tends to be the “master record” of their employee data), compared to other incumbents operating in the HCM space. In Italy there are a few international players (e.g. ADP, SAP on the enterprise side, factorial on the SME side) and a few local HCM providers (F2A on upper end of enterprise market, Zucchetti, WK, Inaz and others on the small and mid-size market). Across all HR software, Zucchetti is the leader in both HCM & payroll. We estimate our share to be approximately 7% in the HCM software segment (11% share when focusing only on SME and micro customer segments), and 22% in the Payroll segment (including software used by both enterprises and labor consultants, we have leading shares when focusing only on labor consultants).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

We currently have a strong positioning in Italy and the product can be easily exported internationally, especially where we already have ERP / FMS offering.

According to the Global Consulting Company Report, as of June 30, 2023, we held more than 30% share in Italy based on market value in the Micro business customer segment. According to IDC, we held a share based on numbers of seats of approximately 30% (compared to an approximate 23% combined share of our three closest competitors) and more than 30% (compared to an approximate 44% combined share of our three closest competitors) in the Italian Enterprise and Professional customer segments, respectively, as of the same date. _Micro_ Based on the most recently available data in 2023, the Italian ERP sector for micro businesses (0-9 employees) was fragmented, with the top three software providers behind TeamSystem accounting for approximately 26% of the market, based on number of seats. In this fragmented market, we have managed to gain a leadership position _vis-à-vis our competitors._ ----- Since our early entry in the Micro customer segment in 2019, we have built a strong customer base and achieved high client satisfaction, enabling us to grow our share above 30% between 2019 and the first half of 2023 (Global Consulting Company Report). Our comprehensive offering of innovative software solutions has allowed us to navigate the evolving Italian regulatory environment and establish our leadership position within this fragmented sector. We offer a comprehensive set of solutions on top of basic e-invoicing, which is very appealing to our micro customer base: from accounting and bookkeeping, to verticalized solutions (Spors, HoreCa), to marketing automation and digital finance. Our extensive product suite not only solidifies our share within our reference segments but also enhances customer loyalty and engagement. As a result, our closest top three competitors in this segment held a collective estimated share in the sector of approximately 26% as of June 30, 2023, underscoring our established leadership and the effectiveness of our first-mover advantage (Global Consulting Company Report). _Enterprise (Small (10-49 employees) and mid-size (50-499 employees))_ In 2023, the Italian ERP sector for Enterprises (10-499 employees) was fragmented, with the top three software providers behind TeamSystem accounting for approximately 20% of the market, based on number of seats. In this segment, we have managed to gain a leadership position vis-à-vis our competitors. We believe that we and other large Italian software providers are best positioned to take advantage of this sector due to several factors. Firms with greater resources can offer a wider range of services, cover a greater geographical reach and deliver consistent quality of customer support. Additionally, large national providers benefit from economies of scale in providing services and products to a large number of customers across and are able to invest higher resources in product research and development to keep up with technological innovation and regulatory evolution and to maintain their product offer aligned with state-of-the-art technology. Finally, customers are less likely to be concerned about the risk that their services will be discontinued when dealing with large providers. As a result, we have established ourselves as a clear leader in the Italian Enterprise (small and mid-size) customer segments. The remaining space is divided among numerous smaller ERP and FMS software providers. We do not compete with international software providers such as Microsoft and SAP as they target large and multinational enterprises, which are not our target customers. _Professional_ While the Italian professional customer segment is more stable and mature compared to the SMEs and micro businesses customer segment, large providers are still best positioned to take advantage of the fragmentation remaining in the market due to similar factors to those relevant to the SMEs and micro and small businesses customer segment. In addition, larger national and international firms are better placed to promptly implement software updates critical to professional services firms, such as those relating to changes in regulation or accounting standards. Moreover, superior brand recognition derived from being a key provider in this market may be leveraged to both attract new customers and retain existing customers.

In order to provide our customers with best-in-class solutions to facilitate the digitalization of their processes, we have been integrating AI solutions and tools across our entire product suite to enhance automation, predictive capabilities and overall efficiency, thereby elevating customer experience and increasing productivity. Moreover, we have continuously evolved our product suite and underlying technologies. Based on our innovative SaaS platform, we have developed a comprehensive set of cloud-based software products that allowed us to penetrate the large segment of micro and small businesses customers in Italy, which have not historically utilized on premise software solutions mainly due to their relative complexity, enabling us to maintain a strong leadership position among accountants and mid-sized business customer. In addition, due to our technologically advanced and fully developed and integrated suite of digital products such as HR, Digital Signature, Digital Finance solutions, authentication, customer analytics and relationship management, we believe we are better positioned than our competitors to exploit the growing demand for digitalization solutions in both our Italian and international relevant sectors. We expect that the demand for digitalization solutions will continue to grow, driven by supportive regulations and incentives, as well as the need for customers to adapt to a changing environment that demands operational efficiency and automation. For example, in Italy we foresee potential opportunities from the upcoming tax reform on e-receipts which is expected to extend further than the current e-invoicing prescribed for businessto-business relationships. At an international level, we plan to benefit from the mandatory e-invoicing adoption in both Spain and Turkey.

We believe we have established positions across all key segments in which we operate. As of June 30, 2023, we held an approximately 30% share in the small and mid-market businesses customer segment and more than 30% share in the professionals customer segment, in each case in Italy, based on number of seats (IDC). In addition, according to the Global Consulting Company Report, we held more than 30% share in the micro businesses customer segment in terms of value over the same period. As of June 30, 2023, we had a growing or established presence in the sectors in which we operate, including Digital Finance, HCM, payroll and industry-specific sectors, with shares of up to 22% in some of these segments. Moreover, as of June 30, 2023, our strategic operations and leadership enabled us to achieve a share of approximately 4% in Spain and approximately 14% in Turkey, based on revenue generated within these sectors divided by the estimated SAM of each sector and expressed as a percentage thereof, thus successfully establishing our presence in these growing sectors. We offer our products and services through six main business units: - Professional Solutions. Our Professional Solutions business unit includes software for professionals, including accountants, and labor consultants, including accounting, payroll, billing and compliance tools. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Professional Solutions business unit accounted for 28.3% of our total revenue. - Micro Solutions.

Our Cross Segment Product Solutions offers HR and Trust solutions, including digital signature, archive and digital identity services, which are fully integrated with our ERP systems. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Cross Segment Product Solutions business unit accounted for 6.8% of our total revenue. - Digital Finance Solutions. Our Digital Finance Solutions business unit includes digital financial valueadded services designed to streamline financial operations of our customers and address their needs, such as rating services, credit management and digital payment solutions. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, our Digital Finance Solutions business unit accounted for 2.8% of our total revenue. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated total revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of €778.7 million (compared to €423 million for the year ended December 31, 2020) and €334.8 million (compared to €209 million for the year ended December 31, 2020), respectively. The following chart sets forth our total revenue breakdown by business unit for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 83.5% of our total revenue from recurring sources, which are primarily related to annual software assistance and maintenance contracts, annual subscription contracts, annual fees from our multi-year contracts with VARs and fees from temporary annual licenses (licenze _temporanee annuali) that we sell to our customers whenever the Italian government introduces a new regulatory_ obligation (e.g., a new tax digital reporting obligation or tax payment) that requires a dedicated feature to be added to our software products (we refer to such temporary annual licenses as “Regulatory LTAs”). We believe that our technology leadership, significant and ongoing expansion of our cloud-based solutions, the mission-critical nature of our products and the overall willingness of our customers to renew their contracts have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to our high annual subscription contracts and renewal rates. Most of our products are deeply integrated into our end-customers’ IT systems and business processes, and their replacement is normally a complicated, time-consuming and expensive process, requiring extensive training for users. In addition, our digital and cloud-based solutions platform, Digital Invoice, designed to operate across all our digital products, is integrated with all our ERP solutions and allows our customers to digitally send, receive, register and store electronic invoices from and to private customers, companies, public entities, banks and external accountants and to send tax filings to the relevant tax authorities electronically. Our three key customer groups are micro and small businesses, mid-market businesses and professionals, which are located both in Italy and abroad. Our end-customer base, including VAR’s end-customers, increased from approximately 88,000 as of December 31, 2009 to approximately 2.1 million as of December 31, 2023. Of this total figure, approximately 87.7% are micro and small businesses, approximately 8.6% are mid-market businesses and approximately 3.7% are professionals. Our large and diverse customer base is highly fragmented and diversified in terms of size and geography. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 276 thousand customers outside of Italy, our ten largest customers generated 5.0% of our total revenue, while our 50 largest customers and 200 largest customers generated 10.4% and 15.3%, respectively. Our customer base is also spread across a variety of industries, including accountancy, labor advisory, manufacturing, industrial, construction, wellness, hospitality, fashion, retail, distribution, food and beverage, legal and other professional services sectors. We have strategically internalized our VARs to establish stronger and more direct relationships with our customer base. This approach allows us to provide personalized and seamless services, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Such approach also supports our upselling initiatives, offering tailored solutions that meet the evolving needs of our clients and aiding them in the continuing transition to cloud solutions. Through these efforts, we ensure our clients benefit from the latest technological advancements while maintaining our competitive edge in the field. In furtherance of our internalization strategy, we have continued to pursue a series of bolt-on acquisitions ----- to bolster our competitive position, expand our product offerings and continue our international expansion. In recent years, we expanded into Spain by acquiring a controlling interest in the Spanish start-up Billin and consolidated our presence in the country by acquiring Software del Sol. In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio with acquisitions such as Acumbamail and Aplifisa, and entered the Turkish sector by acquiring the Mikro group. Lastly, in 2024, we entered into an acquisition agreement with the French ERP software provider to continue expand our presence outside of Italy. Our acquisitions have contributed positively to our revenue growth, product and business mix diversification. This acquisition strategy is key to our growth plan, driving sustained expansion and reinforcing our leadership in the sector. We implemented a series of nominal price increases across our customer segments. In the micro and small businesses customer segment, prices were raised by a total of 10 percentage points from 2021 to 2023, due to a high inflationary environment. In the mid-market segment, we saw a nominal price increase of 3.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023, while in the professionals customer segment, also from 2020 to 2023, prices increased by 7.0 percentage points over the same period. During these periods, we also observed changes in customer churn. In the micro and small businesses segment, churn decreased by 0.2 percentage points between 2021 and 2023. The mid-market segment experienced a slight 0.5 percentage points churn increase between 2020 and 2023, and in the professionals customer segment, churn decreased by 1.8 percentage points from 2020 to 2023. We divide our product offering into the following three product suites and five horizontal solutions:",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.86,Our strengths,17.86.1,Large and growing segments benefitting from secular digitalization with regulatory tailwinds and significant investments and expertise requirements,"We offer both cloud solutions (SaaS and IaaS) and on-premises solutions, in each case across sizeable and attractive sectors both in Italy and internationally, which offer substantial growth opportunities mainly supported by regulatory tailwinds, operational complexities and considerable initial investments. While Italy remains our core segment, we have entered the Spanish segment in 2020 in which we further consolidated our position in 2023 through the acquisition of Acumbamail and Aplifisa, as well as the Turkish segment, where in 2023 we acquired MikroGrup, a leading local player. As a leading player in the ERP sector in Italy, Spain and Turkey, we believe we are well-positioned to leverage the favorable conditions and expected trends in these countries to drive growth and expand our competitive presence. ----- As December 31, 2023, our total SAM was estimated to be worth approximately €5.8 billion (approximately €11.5 billion of TAM), growing at an expected CAGR of approximately 9% between 2023 and 2027. Our SAM has grown over time, from approximately €1.1 billion in 2016, to approximately €5.8 billion in 2023, due to the growth of our core Italian ERP sector and entry into new segments such as HR, Digital Finance and CRM and automation, as well as new geographies such as Spain and Turkey. Moreover, the SAM is expected to further grow to approximately €8.3 billion in 2027. These SAM figures include also the International ERP and FMS sectors in Spain and Turkey, which are estimated to be worth approximately €1.0 billion (€3.2 billion TAM) in 2023 and are expected to growth at a CAGR of approximately 12% between 2023 and 2027. Our SAM has significantly expanded via both geographic reach and product diversification, making it less susceptible to macroeconomic fluctuations. Historically, our SAM has demonstrated robust resilience through various economic cycles, including the financial crises of 2009 and 2012, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, consistently outperforming Italy’s GDP growth. This resilience is further reinforced by our strategic focus and successful repositioning initiatives in high-growth segments, such as micro and digital finance. _Source: Global Consulting Company Report for Italy, Management analysis for Spain and Turkey, International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Database, April 2024, for GDP. Note: Chart displays organic SAM growth, assuming a like-for-like perimeter year over year._ We believe there is still significant whitespace to benefit from, equivalent to the difference between SAM and TAM, which we expect to target by expanding our product offering and increasing customer reach, thereby targeting client segments currently not covered or not served with specific propositions. The ERP sector in Italy, Spain, and Turkey are expected to experience continued growth, propelled by regulatorydriven tailwinds, ongoing digitalization, increased ERP software adoption across all customer sizes, and the transition to cloud-based solutions. These factors result in us being well placed to further benefit from our competitive positions and capitalize on emerging opportunities. _Italy_ In Italy, the main drivers for growth are stable demand, regulatory tailwinds, digitalization and ERP uptake, cloud transition, cybersecurity concerns and growing adoption of generative AI. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these trends and further expand our presence across our reference segments. The Italian ERP software market is characterized by operational complexities and considerable initial investments, particularly for international competitors, due to cultural and local commercial complexities. These include language barriers, complex payroll rules, local accounting standards (Italian GAAP), and evolving regulatory constraints in key sectors like banking, energy, and healthcare. These complexities favor local and regional players, allowing us to capitalize on our leading position in the field. Our deep knowledge of the domestic ----- landscape and long-standing relationships with a wide cross-section of Italian customers and partners further strengthen our competitive advantage. In 2021, local and regional players held a combined 55% share, compared to an average of 25% in other EU countries, as shown in the chart below. _Source: Global Consulting Company Report._ ERP solutions are fundamental to the day-to-day activities of businesses, especially as the operations of Italian enterprises become increasingly complex. This complexity drives demand for a broader range of innovative management solutions to monitor key activities. Accounting and payroll management software remain core due to stringent Italian regulations requiring digital fiscal and labor filings. Our state-of-the-art cloud-based solutions ensure compliance with these demanding and ever-changing regulatory requirements, providing seamless support even in light of changing regulations. This allows our customers to focus on their core activities without diverting pivotal resources, ensuring stable demand and revenues for our mission-critical services. The ongoing digitalization trend in Italy is primarily driven by stringent regulatory requirements, which impose significant fiscal and administrative burdens on companies and create a strong demand for up-to-date management software that streamlines administrative functions and establishes operational complexities and considerable initial investments for new competitors. We are well-positioned to meet this demand by providing products and updates that help clients ensure regulatory compliance. Subsidies introduced over the past few years, such as the “Industry 4.0” initiative, which offers financial vouchers to promote the digitalization of SMEs and micro and small businesses, and the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza), which allocates approximately €40 billion for digitalization projects across the public sector, further incentivize digitalization in Italy. Moreover, the increasing role of European ESG regulations, such as the CSRD, is expected to drive demand for ESG software solutions. These regulations require standardized ESG disclosures from both large enterprises and SMBs, creating a need for sophisticated compliance tools. Our expertise and comprehensive product offerings uniquely position us to help businesses navigate these regulatory landscapes, consolidating our competitive position leadership and expanding our customer base. The Italian market is also poised to benefit from government policies, incentives, and subsidies that promote digitalization. Italy demonstrates strong performance in the adoption of cloud services, with approximately 50% of enterprises utilizing this technology, significantly surpassing the EU average of 34%. Unlike other Mediterranean countries, Italy’s penetration rates for cloud services more closely resemble those of Nordic and Benelux economies, which have historically been more advanced in terms of digitalization. ----- The chart below shows the digitalization rate of EU countries as of December 31, 2023[(1)]: _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI); 2023 Indicators, data from 2021._ Note: “Enterprise with Clouds Solutions” represents enterprises which have adopted at least one of the following cloud solutions: finance or accounting software applications; ERP software applications; CRM software applications; security software applications; hosting the enterprise’s database(s); computing platform providing a hosted environment for application development, testing or deployment. Furthermore, approximately 70% of SMEs in Italy have at least a basic level of digital intensity, just above the EU average of 69%, and well above other Mediterranean countries such as France and Spain. Progress in digitalization in Italy is especially pronounced in the use of e-invoices, where Italy outperforms the European average, being one of the first countries to make e-invoices mandatory for all companies, regardless of size. This strong adoption of cloud services and digital tools underscores the readiness of Italian enterprises to embrace digital transformation, further driving demand for our advanced ERP and FMS solutions. _Source: Digital economy and society index (DESI) 2023 Indicators, data from 2022. The digital intensity score is based on counting how many of twelve selected technologies are used by enterprises. A basic level requires usage of at least four technologies._ Despite the above, the Italian market is considered to be still at the early stages of its digital transformation journey. While it has achieved a nearly 100% adoption rate for e-invoicing software across companies of all sizes, driven by government regulations, there remain substantial growth opportunities for ERP, CRM and business intelligence software, especially among micro and small-sized businesses where the adoption rate is currently below 30%. ----- The chart below shows the software adoption rate by company size as of December 31, 2023 _Source: ISTAT report imprese 2023._ Lastly, within the global cloud market, the ERP sector is less penetrated than other functional markets. Adoption of cloud-based ERP software has been slower compared to financial applications and performance software, which remain predominantly on-premise. This contrasts with the CRM and HCM sectors, where the transition to cloudbased technology has been quicker. The slower adoption rate of ERP systems is due to their mission-critical nature and the increased need for customization compared to CRM and HCM systems. However, cloud adoption in the Italian ERP sector has been steadily increasing, with penetration expected to reach approximately 48% of the market in 2023 and continue to rise thereafter. We believe this additional trend presents a significant opportunity for us to expand our cloud-based ERP offerings and capture a growing share. The ever-increasing demand for cybersecurity is also a significant growth driver, with cyber attacks rising dramatically across all industries. In 2022, global cyber attacks increased by 21.5% compared to 2021, and Italy saw a staggering 170% increase, making it the fourth most targeted country. Many attacks result from human error, highlighting the need for better technology training and simple software solutions. With low current SMB adoption of cybersecurity software, there is a substantial growth opportunity for products dedicated to cyber risks mitigation. We believe the EU Cybersecurity SMB software TAM, which was worth approximately €12 billion in 2022, is expected to grow by 12% between 2022 and 2024. By offering and integrating robust cybersecurity features into our ERP and FMS solutions, we can enhance our value proposition and consolidated our position within the sector. Furthermore, the availability of new technology, such as advanced machine learning and generative AI, is a crucial growth driver. The AI sector, which includes software, hardware, and services, is projected to grow at a CAGR of 18% between 2020 and 2025, with software being the dominant segment. Success in the ERP space will depend on leveraging generative AI for internal efficiency and integrating it into customer solutions. In Italy, AI awareness is increasing, with many professionals recognizing it as a key trend and considering AI products to enhance efficiency and productivity. Our significant investments in Data and AI position us to meet our customers’ evolving needs, offering advanced AI-infused business applications that drive efficiency and productivity, thereby strengthening our competitive edge. _Spain_ We believe that, similar to Italy, growth in the Spanish ERP sector is driven by regulatory changes, increasing digitalization, and the transition to cloud-based solutions. Regulation in Spain plays an active role in sustaining our sector dynamics. Key regulatory trends expected to positively impact the ERP sector in Spain include grants and subsidies, tax level changes, accounting software standard enforcement, and mandatory e-invoicing. Spain is making notable progress in digital technology integration, particularly through initiatives targeting the digitalization of SMEs and the self-employed. These efforts are driving the growth in the ERP sector and increasing the demand for advanced accounting software due to potential fiscal complexities from ongoing tax rate debates and heightened standards following recent data breaches. The shift from voluntary to mandatory einvoicing, set to be compulsory for small and micro-enterprises by 2026 and for larger enterprises by 2024, is a key growth driver. Despite SMEs’ digitalization levels being slightly below the EU average, the Spanish government’s investments in digitalization present significant growth opportunities, not only enhancing SMEs’ capabilities but also impacting ICT specialists, infrastructure, and digital public services. Additionally, measures to boost cloud computing adoption are underway, addressing the current lag behind the European average. ----- Key growth drivers in Spain over the next few years include strong upsell and cross-sell opportunities, with a significant increase in average revenue per customer expected, and a rapid shift to cloud-based services. Cloud penetration is expected to grow substantially across segments, including accountants and small to mid-sized companies. With a deep understanding of the market and a comprehensive suite of ERP and FMS solutions, we believed we are strategically positioned to harness these trends, meeting the evolving needs of the Spanish segment. _Turkey_ Similar to Italy and Spain, growth in the Turkish ERP sector is expected to be driven by regulatory changes and increased digitalization. The Turkish government has worked towards combating the shadow economy by establishing online systems for real-time tracking and auditing. Key initiatives such as e-integration, mandatory online salary payments, and enhanced auditing systems are expected to sustain growth within the ERP sector. Current regulations require companies with a certain level of turnover to comply with e-invoicing regulations, and the inflationary environment in Turkey is likely to increase the number of companies falling within this threshold, therefore expanding the sector.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In terms of customers, our leading position spans across the Italian micro and small businesses customer segment (“Micro”), in terms of value, which mainly refers to FMS solutions for micro enterprise (including e-invoicing, accounting software and POS systems), mid-market business customer segment (“Enterprise”) in terms of number of seats, which refer to the segment for ERP software for SMEs, and professional customer segment (“Professional”), in terms of number of seats, which comprises accountants and labor and tax advisors. According to the Global Consulting Company Report, as of June 30, 2023, we held more than 30% share in Italy based on market value in the Micro business customer segment. According to IDC, we held a share based on numbers of seats of approximately 30% (compared to an approximately 23% combined share of our three closest competitors) and more than 30% (compared to an approximately 44% combined share of our three closest competitors) in the Italian Enterprise and Professional customer segments, respectively, as of the same date. Our leading position in Italy across our customer segments is the result of many years of developing our proprietary software through significant investment, which has established our reputation for high-quality and reliable products and services in such segments. Since our early entry in the Micro customer segment in 2019, we have built a strong customer base and achieved high client satisfaction, enabling us to grow our share above 30% in terms number of seats between 2019 and the first half of 2023 (Global Consulting Company Report). Our comprehensive offering of innovative software solutions has allowed us to navigate the evolving Italian regulatory environment and establish our leadership position within this fragmented sector. Our extensive product suite not only solidifies our share within our reference segments but also enhances customer loyalty and engagement. As a result, our closest top three competitors in this segment held a collective estimated share in the sector of approximately 26.0% as of June 30, 2023, underscoring our established leadership and the effectiveness of our first-mover advantage (Global Consulting Company Report). In the Enterprise customer segment, we have achieved a clear leadership position, underpinned by our mission to support SMEs in their digital transformation and to improve their efficiency and competitiveness while ensuring compliance with the Italian regulatory framework. Our ability to offer a wide range of services has enabled us to benefit from significant economies of scale. Our integrated and customizable platform of solutions allow us to address the needs of companies across selected verticals, reinforcing our leadership and driving sustained growth. The Professional customer segment is relatively more stable and mature compared to other segments. Our leadership in this segment, which we have maintained since 2019, is underpinned by superior brand recognition, supported by a loyal customer base and delivery of high-quality, reliable and integrated software solutions, which ensures that we remain the preferred choice for professional customers, further consolidating our competitive position. In terms of product offering, we believe to have achieved a promising position in key product segments such as Digital Finance, human resources solutions and certain industry-specific segments. In particular, in the Digital Finance segment we see significant opportunities to further expand our product offerings and increase our ----- competitive presence. Holding less than 1% share in 2023, as a percentage of SAM, there is a high potential for revenue generation in the Digital Finance segment. In the human resources solutions segment, which encompasses HCM and payroll software, we achieved an approximately 7% share in the HCM segment, and an approximately 22% share in the payroll segment, in each case as of June 30, 2023. Furthermore, as of June 30, 2023, we held an approximately 22% share for CAD/CAM solutions and an approximately 7% for Extended CRM and marketing automation. With regards to our geographic sector, we believe we are a leading player in Italy in the ERP sector. In addition, we also operate in attractive segments outside of Italy. Our international expansion began in 2020 with acquisitions in Spain, followed by Turkey in 2022. These strategic moves have significantly increased our presence and influence in these key segments. For our international segment, mainly comprising ERP software solutions for Spain and Turkey, the SAM and TAM amounted to approximately €1.0 billion and approximately €3.2 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2023. Our strategic operations and experienced leadership enabled us to achieve a share of approximately 4% in Spain, which increased from approximately 2% in 2020, and an approximately 14% share in Turkey, based on revenue generated within these segments divided by the estimated SAM of each segment and expressed as a percentage thereof for the same period. These results underscore our rapid development of influence and competitive edge in these segments.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In 2014, we became one of the first companies in Italy to invest in cloud products, which allowed us to gain a significant competitive advantage in the Italian business management software sector. By 2015, we started developing an integrated SaaS platform with extensive application programing interfaces and a strong emphasis on UX and user interface design, positioning ourselves swiftly as a center of excellence. We believe that our SaaS platform excels through its comprehensive approach to cross-selling end-to-end digitalization services, benefiting from high-level services, such as Digital Finance, Trust Services, and marketing automation, shared across multiple customer segments to enhance value and efficiency. By incorporating lowlevel utilities shared across the platform and focusing on front-end/UX enhancements, workflow optimizations, dedicated modules, and end-to-end integration, we deliver a seamless and intuitive user experience. Additionally, a common data repository supports our integrated approach, ensuring data consistency, accuracy and accessibility. Cloud products accounted for 48.5% of our revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 40% in the year ended December 31, 2021. As of March 31, 2024, we had successfully transitioned approximately 92% of our customers to at least one cloud solution, underscoring our leadership in the sector. ----- Our platform integrates advanced analytics and AI to drive growth and differentiation. We use data-driven approaches to enhance operations and products and automating and reducing manual tasks. Our AI investments focus on creating an AI platform for generative AI and machine learning, developing tools like virtual assistants, enhancing data platforms and governance, and fostering a data-driven culture for better cross-business coordination. Our ongoing investments in R&D, contributing to our continuous growth, are crucial for transforming our products to meet the diverse needs of our large and diversified customer base and increasing our recurring revenue through regular upgrades and price adjustments. In particular, between 2020 and 2023, we invested an average of €60 million per year in R&D activities, excluding cloud and infrastructure costs. As of March 31, 2024, our commitment to innovation was supported by approximately 1,200 software engineers managing over 100 million lines of code.

Our Net Revenue Retention rate reached 106% as of December 31, 2023, demonstrating our ability to drive organic revenue growth within our existing customer base. This strong retention rate highlights the value and effectiveness of our solutions, fostering long-term customer loyalty and consistent revenue growth. We believe these results underscore the exceptional value and satisfaction our customers derive from our products and services, as well as our ability to drive top-line revenue growth from our existing customers. Our customer base is large, diversified and fragmented, which mitigates risks related to declines in product demand in any one particular industry and reduces reliance on revenues from a small number of key customers. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our ten largest customers generated 5.0% of our total revenue, while our 50 largest customers and 200 largest customers generated 10.4% and 15.3%, respectively, over the same period. We also do not have any major single industry exposure, while keeping a significant contribution from resilient sectors and low exposure to industries typically more affected by macroeconomic disruptions (e.g., restaurants, bars and catering, hospitality, tour operators and travel agencies).

NPS, a metric used to calculate customer satisfaction, represents the percentage of customers rating their likelihood to recommend our products to others. It is measured as the sum of the percentage of promoters (loyal customers, repeat buyers, and those most likely to promote our business willingly) less the percentage of detractors (customers unlikely to buy our products again). Our high NPS indicates that our products not only generate high customer satisfaction but also maintain such satisfaction consistently across diverse sectors. Our NPS also demonstrates the universal appeal and reliability of our offerings. This level of customer advocacy also contributes to our sustained growth and competitive advantage, highlighting that our products resonate well with a wide range of customers and industry needs. The table below shows our growing NPS levels from the last quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022 to the last quarter of the year ended December 31, 2023. _Source: Nielsen._ We have historically experienced high and stable Customer Retention Rates. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, we have experienced high and stable Customer Retention Rates of approximately (i) 90.3%, 90.0% and 90.7, respectively, for micro and small business customers; (ii) 90.7%, 92.5% and 91.8%, respectively, for mid-market business customers; and (iii) 91.7%, 93% and 92.8%, respectively, for professionals. Customer Retention Rate for micro and small businesses customers is typically slightly lower than Customer Retention Rate for mid-market customers and professionals due to the lower switching costs associated with solutions for micro and small business, mainly as a result of their lower level of complexity, and frequent business lifecycle changes within this segment. We believe that the mission-critical nature of our software products and services, which are deeply embedded in many of our customers’ workflows and IT systems, has historically provided a degree of insulation from economic uncertainties and resulted in our high Customer Retention Rates. Our customers’ operations depend upon our products to facilitate data flow, not only in-house, with respect to internal business management data analysis and storage, but also externally, between our customers and other businesses or between our customers, banks, tax authorities and other public administration organizations. In addition, our high Customer Retention Rate is also supported by our customers’ satisfaction and overall willingness to renew their subscriptions. In particular, mid-market and professional customers tend to carefully consider the migration to alternative software providers in light of, among others,: (i) the mission-critical nature of software and the possibility that customers may be exposed to data migration risk during a transition to an alternative supplier; (ii) the cost and length of time required to transition to an alternative platform given that ERP systems are integral to the various operational segments of an organization; and (iii) the training required to familiarize employees with new software. Moreover, for the professionals customer segment, we believe the adoption of our digital ancillary solutions allows a strong connection and digital interrelation between our professional customers and their endcustomers, making our professional customers more dependent on our products in their day-to-day activities, which, in turn, incentivizes our customers to continue using our products and not to switch to competitors’ solutions. Our NPS for each of our Professional, Enterprise Solutions, Market Specific Solutions and Micro Solutions business units has shown a positive trend over the last four years. This positive trend, as illustrated in the chart below, underscores our ability to consistently deliver value and satisfaction to our customers, further solidifying our position as a leader in Italy. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Our proven integration playbook has consistently enabled us to achieve revenue and cost synergies, in the form of cross-selling and upselling for the former and in the form of workforce and real estate rationalization, procurement centralization and other product (for example, the use of Group ----- developer pool, architecture and UX) synergies for the latter. We have been able to achieve for the cohorts acquired between 2011 and 2023 an average revenue CAGR between 15% and 20% and an EBITDA margin expansion between 14 and 16 percentage points, in each case post acquisition. The main goals we have pursued with the latest acquisitions, and intend to continue pursuing, relate to the following main areas: - _product and capabilities enhancement: we have strategically acquired selected startups, software houses, and individual business units to enhance our opportunity to cross-sell and expand our presence in the segments served by these entities; these acquisitions aim at reducing our time-to-market for the launch of new cloud-based and industry specific solutions, providing us with an advantage over our competitors and allowing us to internalize relevant competences and expertise on innovative technologies and products (e.g., solutions for e-mail and SMS marketing as well as technical software for the construction and engineering sectors); - _international expansion: in recent years, we have completed several acquisitions to expand our footprint outside of Italy. This includes selected acquisitions in Spain, where new e-invoicing regulations are expected to be gradually implemented in the coming years, and we anticipate strong digitalization trends and growth potential, particularly in the micro and small business customer segment. Additionally, we have acquired a leading player in Turkey, a geographic area which comprises over 3 million enterprises with high growth and digitalization potential; and - _VARs insourcing: we have acquired and we intend to continue acquiring our VARs. By doing so, we aim to establish strong and direct relationships with our customers, further support our upselling initiatives and continue their transition to cloud solutions. We have a dedicated team focused on the integration of acquired companies and we have developed a disciplined and structured approach to plan and execute all activities required to successfully integrate and extract revenue and cost synergies from acquired companies. In particular, the integration process involves all aspects of the acquired businesses, including finance, cybersecurity, compliance, data protection, reporting, personnel, procurement, facility management, R&D, product integration, marketing and sales and the definition of the value proposition and go-to-market approach for the newly acquired and integrated products. We have made a number of selected and, we believe, highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions over the past few years which we believe have contributed to our success. In particular, over the years, we have developed a structured process to integrate the acquired entities through a well-developed process which spans from three to 24 months, depending on the features and complexities of the deal. Between 2021 and 2022 we have been able to successfully complete a series of bolt-on acquisitions which allowed us to expand and consolidate our presence in terms of product offering and geography. In 2023, we further expanded our portfolio with key acquisitions, including MailUp, a marketing automation platform, and GreeNext, a software developer for waste management. Additionally, we strengthened our presence in Spain by acquiring Acumbamail and Aplifisa, and entered Turkey by acquiring the Mikro group, enhancing our offerings in marketing, accounting, and ERP solutions. Furthermore, we believe that the acquisitions we made have generated revenue synergies. Such acquisitions gave us, for example, the ability to increase our brand recognition internationally, cross-sell and up-sell the products that we acquired to our existing customer base and to enrich our product offering in key strategic areas (e.g., marketing automation with Mail-Up, e-commerce with Storeden, GreenNext for waste management solutions and Beneficy Welfare to enrich our HR platform).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Our resilience is evidenced by a consistent pattern of organic revenue growth since 2009, even during periods of economic turbulence. We believe such sustained growth is attributable to several key factors: (i) the recurring nature of our contracts; (ii) our customers’ loyalty, as demonstrated by our high NPS and low churn rates; (iii) the mission-critical nature of our software, our broad, rich and fully integrated product suite, which makes customers, particularly SMEs and professional clients, reluctant to switch to alternative suppliers due to the time-consuming migration process, allowing us to maintain sales even during economic downturns; and (iv) our strong brand recognition. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we generated 83.5% of our total revenue from recurring sources (compared to 81.6% in 2021), which we believe provides significant visibility of future earnings. In particular, in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 our recurring revenue accounted for 86.5% of our total revenue underscoring our stability and predictability from the first months of each calendar year. The growth in the contribution of revenues with a recurring nature to our total revenue has been driven in part by the increased weight and importance of our cloud solutions in our product portfolio, with the contribution of cloud software solutions revenue to our total revenue increasing from 39.8% in 2021 to 48.5% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. In addition, our profitability and cash flow generation have also shown significant improvement. Our Adjusted EBITDA grew from €170.1 million (€199.7 million on a pro forma basis to give effect the 2021 Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021) in 2021 to €227.3 million in 2022, €313.8 million in 2023, and €334.9 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. As a result, our Adjusted EBITDA margin grew from ----- 41.4% in 2021 (40.8% on a pro forma basis to give effect the 2021 Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2021) to 43.0% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. We believe there is a correlation between margins and shares in our reference sectors, therefore, we see strong upside potential as we consolidate our multi-platform offerings. Furthermore, our invoicing strategy enhances our financial stability by invoicing our customers in advance at the beginning of each calendar year during our annual budgeting process. Additionally, most of our contracts are typically renewed unless customers provide a written termination notice prior to expiration. This approach gives us strong visibility over our cash flows and capital requirements, allowing us to carefully plan our capital needs and ensuring consistent and regular revenue streams. We believe that our billing pattern contributes to the overall visibility of our cash flows and ensures substantial liquidity. With over 70% of invoices issued between fourth quarter of each calendar year and the first quarter of the subsequent calendar year, we secure significant cash-in contributions in the first half of the year, effectively covering our cash needs, with about 30% of invoices issued during the second and third quarter of the year, primarily for prepaid cloud products for micro and small businesses. Approximately 35% of our invoices are issued in January and 50% by March, providing us with the liquidity needed for the rest of the year. Year-end invoicing for our In Cloud products, sold on annual subscription models, further enhances cash flow predictability. We believe that this invoicing strategy enables us to effectively predict and monitor our revenue and cash flow levels, ensuring strong liquidity and contributing to our financial stability and operational efficiency.

We intend to continue consolidating our presence in Spain and Turkey while exploring further expansion opportunities, including other European countries. The Spanish ERP sector presents significant growth opportunities. Spain currently lags slightly behind the European average in terms of digitalization, with publicly available data indicating that only approximately onethird of enterprises have adopted cloud solutions. We aim to capitalize on this substantial growth potential by expanding our presence and establishing ourselves as the preferred provider for businesses transitioning to digital business management by, among others, offering comprehensive cloud solutions alongside user-friendly einvoicing systems. Similar to the Italian ERP sector, we believe that favorable regulatory trends in Spain, including mandatory e-invoicing, will facilitate further sector expansion. In particular, the mandatory e-invoicing regulations in Spain, expected to be implemented between 2025 and 2027, present a significant opportunity for growth and expansion. This regulatory change is anticipated to unlock substantial potential, benefitting from an estimated 3.4 million of addressable customers, of which 3.3 million micro businesses and 0.1 million SMEs as of December 31, 2023. The implementation will follow a specific timeline based on a turnover threshold of €8 million, requiring legal entities and sole traders above this threshold to issue and receive e-invoices. We believe this regulatory shift will facilitate the adoption of our comprehensive cloud solutions and user-friendly e-invoicing systems by offering tailored solutions for businesses transitioning to digital business management. ----- In Turkey, the mandatory adoption of e-invoicing, driven by inflation and efforts to address the shadow economy, presents another growth opportunity for us to cater to an estimated 3.8 million of addressable customers, of which 3.5 million micro businesses and 0.3 million SMEs as of December 31, 2023. The expansion of e-invoicing compliance, expected to be implemented between 2023 and 2027, will require e-invoicing for companies with a turnover of 3 million Turkish lira. Approximately 800,000 businesses are expected to fall within the regulation by 2025, with more than 1 million by 2027 due to inflation. This regulatory change is likely to drive micro businesses toward ERP adoption, improving our overall segment penetration.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.91,Our strategy,17.91.5,,"Since 2021, we have focused on the digitalization of our customer base, rationalizing our sales model and strengthening customer retention and satisfaction. Additionally, we have focused on expanding our horizontal solutions to drive upselling and cross-selling opportunities. This strategic emphasis has enabled us to better meet diverse customer needs and enhance our value proposition. Our internationalization efforts have also been pivotal, expanding our presence beyond Italy and capturing new opportunities, which now account for a growing share of our revenue. To support this expansion and our broader growth objectives, we have revised our organizational structure, aligning it more closely with our strategic priorities and improving operational efficiency. As a result of these strategic focuses, we have achieved remarkable growth and transformation, doubling in scale and enhancing our business diversification and quality, with a significant acceleration in value creation. _Business scale: Since 2020, we have made significant progress across multiple dimensions of our business. Our_ total revenue has increased at a CAGR of 20.2% from €422.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, to €778.7 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, with average organic growth over the same period ----- reaching 10%. As part of this overall growth, our international operations have also shown significant expansion. Our adjusted EBITDA has also seen substantial growth, from €181.2 million to €313.8 million over the same period. Additionally, our customer base expanded from 1.6 million as of the year ended December 31, 2021 to 2.1 million as of the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by new client acquisitions, particularly among micro and small businesses adopting mandatory e-invoicing, and international growth in Spain and Turkey, which accounted for approximately 300 thousand customers as of December 31, 2023. _Business Mix and Geographic Diversification: We have accelerated our business diversification both_ geographically and in terms of our business mix. In 2020, we only generated revenues in Italy, whereas for the three months ended March 31, 2024, our international expansions grew at a faster pace than our domestic revenue and accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenue for such period. Additionally, our revenue mix has also evolved significantly since 2020, with the micro and small customer segment representing approximately 27.0% of our total revenues for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 in acceleration representing 31% of our total revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2024, increasing from 18% for the year ended December 31, 2020. We have also increased our focus on cross-selling platforms such as HR, Extended CRM and Trust Services, bolstered by strategic acquisitions which have generated 7% of our total revenues for twelve months ended March 31, 2024. _Business Quality: Our business quality has significantly improved, with recurring revenues increasing from 79.7%_ for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 83.5% for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and cloud revenues rising from 38% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 49.9% of our total revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. Since 2021, our customer retention rates and NPS have both improved, with churn levels decreasing across segments despite price increases, and NPS increasing from 36 as of December 31, 2020 to 55 as of December 31, 2023. As a result of the above, the growth in our organic ARR (representing the annual subscription fees in respect of our subscription agreements relating to certain key products that were in place as of a certain date, net of all subscription fees associated with churning customers who delivered termination notices on or prior to such date) amounted to approximately 10% in 2020, 12% in 2021, 12% in 2022 and 14% in 2023 (with a Net Retention Rate of 105.5%, 104.5%, 107.9% and 106.3% for the same periods). We now plan to continue further consolidating these trends to achieve long-term sustainable growth and strengthen our leadership in our core reference segments by: (i) selectively expanding our customer base; (ii) growing topline revenue by benefitting from upselling and cross-selling opportunities within our large and diversified customer base; and (iii) further improving our sales model while enhancing customer satisfaction and retention rates. Additionally, we aim to fully integrate data analysis and AI into our operations and product suites, enhance our offerings with the launch of SaaS-only products developed under the “One Platform” concept, and continue our commitment to sustainability.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.105,Our Sales Channels,17.105.1,Field Sales Channel,"Our Field Sales Channel provides capillary and extensive geographical coverage through direct and indirect “on field” salesforce, providing software solutions and related services, including installation, start-up, maintenance and post-sale customer assistance, directly to our customers. _Direct Salesforce_ Our direct “on field” salesforce sells our products mainly to our SME and professional end-customers. As of March 31, 2024, our sales team was composed of approximately 230 in-house on-field representatives, distributed throughout our main locations spread across Italy. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, approximately 11 ACG agencies. The ACG agencies, which are not VARs, resell certain of our Enterprise Solutions products, provide software installation services directly to our customers and are remunerated on the basis of a percentage of their sales to our customers. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 2% of our total revenue was generated by ACG agencies. ----- Our sales representatives are employed directly by us while our sales agents operate under exclusive agency contracts, which ensure that their activities are aligned with our objectives and goals, through targets levels, reporting, marketing guidelines, training and pricing policies. In addition, as of March 31, 2024, we had a dedicated team of 16 sales specialists selling, via phone or through our e-commerce website, our Micro and Small Solutions and extended CRM product offering (our “Digital Sales Team”). _Indirect Salesforce_ Our indirect salesforce is mainly composed of our VAR network. VARs resell our products and are mainly focused on professional and mid-sized companies. VARs sell on behalf of ERP software providers and usually operate on an exclusive basis with a single provider. VARs install the relevant software and provide assistance and software maintenance services to customers. The provision of these business services is particularly important to micro and small business and professionals, who do not usually have the necessary in‑house capabilities to efficiently install and maintain a new software system or the ability to train staff in using such new software. In the past, VARs have been key to ensure close customer relationships, enabling us to deliver tailored services, market our products effectively and reach a wider customer base while optimizing commercial costs. However, digital solution adoption and new sales drives, including enhanced reliance on high recurring revenues as well as the industry-wide shift towards SaaS technologies has lessened the necessity for an extensive indirect network, as the breadth of commercial coverage and the need for service proximity become less critical. As a result, we embarked on a VAR transformation program in 2018 to transition from an extensive VAR network to a more streamlined, insourced model. The VAR insourcing initiative is designed to streamline our sales approach and enhance profitability by embedding the insourcing margin directly into our direct salesforce segment, demonstrating our commitment to optimizing our sales channel mix and driving sustained growth through strategic insourcing. In the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, we successfully integrated more than 20 VARs. The program promotes a sell-out-based model to drive business growth and align commercial practices with incentives that encourage sell-out activities. The initiative aims to increase VARs’ coverage size to develop economies of scale and enhance the effectiveness of sales. This process also involves increasing the number of VARs in high-potential geographies, with the goal of establishing a network of selected large VARs to cover low-potential geographies, ensuring full alignment of commercial strategy and sales effectiveness with the direct salesforce. The VAR insourcing initiative has led to an increase in sales productivity by leveraging our best practices, such as incentives and tools. The initiative has also accelerated the penetration of cloud products and expanded our new offering to acquired customers through cross-selling. Financial benefits have been realized from integration, increasing efficiency in customer support, delivery and general and administrative functions. Moreover, the insourcing margin has been embedded into the direct salesforce channel, improving profitability. A prime example of the success of this initiative is the acquisition and subsequent integration of Progetto Studio, which was our largest VAR. Acquired at the end of 2021, Progetto Studio is now managed directly by us as a stand-alone entity, demonstrating our commitment to optimizing our sales channel mix and driving growth through strategic insourcing. The strategic shift has significantly reshaped our sales structure, leading to a reduction in the revenue contribution of our indirect salesforce, which has reduced from 24.5% in 2020 to 13.0% by 2023. As of March 31, 2024, our indirect salesforce included over 100 VARs, which are located and service customers throughout Italy. See “Risk _Factors—Risks related to our business—If we fail to maintain, expand or develop our relationships with VARs and ACG agencies, we could lose a significant portion of our end‑customers, which could have a negative impact on our business and financial conditions” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business—Changes to our sales organization and other corporate functions harm our business and may negatively impact our results of operations.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

While it is available to a diverse customer profile of micro and small businesses, mid-market customers and professionals, the Online Sales Channel has been developed to provide a scalable and user-friendly sales experience, particularly suited to simple and standardized products that do not require a high degree of customization. ----- Revenue from this channel has increased at an average of approximately 15% between 2019 and 2023. This indicates a strong and consistent expansion of online sales, which can be attributed to several strategic initiatives and investments. One of the key performance indicators that underscore the performance of the online channel is the long-term value to customer acquisition cost ratio. This metric, which measures the lifetime value of a customer against the cost of acquiring them, demonstrated a significant return for our top online products in 2022, namely, Fatture in Cloud, Contabilità in Cloud and CRM in Cloud, for which the ratio exceeded a multiple of 5. This ratio demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the online marketing and sales processes, highlighting the channel’s ability to attract and retain valuable customers at a relatively low cost. Marketing efforts have been increased to support the Online Sales Channel’s growth, with marketing spend as a percentage of the channel’s revenue increasing over time. This investment in marketing has been instrumental in driving traffic to our website and converting visitors into customers. The channel’s visibility index has also seen a significant uptick, mirroring our incumbent position in the Italian segment. The Online Sales Channel’s performance is further bolstered by its scalability and the lean and intuitive sales process that it delivers. This approach has made it easier for customers to complete the purchase process, from product discovery to final transaction. The channel’s scalability ensures that we can efficiently manage a growing volume of transactions without a proportional increase in salesforce or support staff.

407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.107,Our Revenue Model,17.107.1,Recurring Revenue,"Recurring revenue is a critical component of our financial strategy, providing a predictable and stable income stream. This model relies on continuous engagement with customers through ongoing services and support. By structuring revenue in a recurring format, we are able to build long-term relationships with clients, ensuring sustained revenue and minimizing the impact of market fluctuations. This stream is further categorized into three models: _Subscription Model_ Our subscription model involves customers subscribing to access our software and data through cloud platforms (SaaS or IaaS) or on-premise installations. The subscription fee encompasses not only access to the software but also customer support, software upgrades and maintenance. There are two types of renewals under our subscription model, which cater to the continuity and convenience of service for the customers: elective renewal and automatic renewal. The elective renewal process is customerinitiated and occurs at the end of the subscription term. Customers who have initially been invoiced for a 12month period may decide whether to continue with the service. As the subscription nears its end in year 2, the customer has the opportunity to actively renew its subscription. This renewal is not automatic and it requires the customer to make a conscious decision to proceed with the services. In contrast, the automatic renewal process does not require any action from the customer for the subscription to continue. Once the initial subscription period, which typically extends for a period of three months, nears completion, the subscription is automatically renewed for a 12-month period. This automatic renewal ensures that there is no disruption in service for the customer. However, if the customer wishes to discontinue the service, they must provide a cancellation notice 6 months in advance of the renewal date to prevent the subscription from rolling over into the new term. _Maintenance Model_ Under the maintenance model, we charge recurring fees for customer support and software maintenance associated with on-premise products for which customers have purchased a perpetual license. These fees cover software updates and optimization services. ----- There are two types of renewals under this model. The first type of renewal is based on the anniversary of the initial maintenance period. In this type, once the license is invoiced in May of year 1, maintenance begins in July of year 1, after a 2-3 month maintenance holiday, for a period of 12 months until June of year 2. The license is then renewed in July of year 2 for another 12-month cycle without any required action from the customer. Customers who wish to discontinue the automatic renewal must provide a cancellation notice at least 6 months before the renewal date to prevent the service from rolling over into a new term. The second mechanism involves annual renewals that are aligned with the calendar year. In this renewal process, maintenance services are initially provided from July of year 1 until December of the same year. The contract is then automatically renewed at the beginning of January of year 2 for a full 12-month period. This renewal requires advance cancellation notice, typically six months before the renewal date. _Consumption Model_ Under the consumption model, fees are based on the level of service consumption. Customers are invoiced periodically (e.g., monthly) based on the volume of service consumed during that period. This model allows for a flexible billing approach that aligns with customer usage patterns.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

License fees are recognized immediately upon sale, while revenue from professional services and hardware is recognized at the time of delivery. This model provides an additional revenue stream through significant transactions that supplement the steady income from recurring revenue models.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Enterprise Solutions business unit showed a distribution between non-recurring and recurring revenue models, with 27.4% of revenue coming from non-recurring sources and the remaining 72.6% split between the subscription and maintenance models of recurring revenue. This suggests that while the Enterprise Solutions business unit’s customers engage in one-off purchases, they also value the ongoing support and updates provided by recurring models. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Professional Solutions business unit relied on 92.8% of revenue coming from recurring sources, with only a small portion, 7.2%, attributed to non-recurring revenue for the same period. The Micro Solutions business unit is heavily reliant on recurring revenue, which accounted for 93.2% of the revenue, with the remaining 6.8% being non-recurring revenue, in each case for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. This demonstrates a strong preference for the subscription-based approach within this segment, likely due to its simplicity and all-inclusive nature. Similar to the Micro business unit, the Digital Finance business unit showed a significant reliance on recurring revenue from the consumption model, accounting for 83.8% of the unit’s revenue, with the remaining 16.2% being non-recurring revenue, in each case for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024. The Market Specific Solutions business unit presented a more balanced distribution for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, with 63.9% being recurring revenue under the subscription model and 36.1% being non-recurring revenue. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Cross Segment Product Solutions business unit also showed greater reliance on recurring revenue, with 80.1% of its revenue being of a recurring type and the remaining 19.9% coming from non-recurring sources. We are actively transitioning towards subscription-based models. As our existing customer base adapts and new clients join, we expect an increase in higher-margin subscription revenue.

We have historically measured employees’ satisfaction and collected employees’ feedback to identify the areas to act on in order to further improve our working environment. In addition, since 2018 we also launched a talent program for our best performing employees, giving them the opportunity to participate in dedicated trainings, leadership programs and mentorship initiatives. In 2022, we launched the Future Shaper program, which aims at promoting employment among recent graduates in the areas where we operate. This initiative offers participants the chance to join our company on a rotational basis, providing them with a broad and strategic perspective of our operations. We believe this program represents a valuable opportunity to discover and integrate new talent who can contribute fresh ideas and drive innovation within our inclusive and supportive workplace culture. Furthermore, we continuously promote work-life balance and healthy food habits; we have initiatives in place to build awareness around and promote diversity and gender balance, as part of both the hiring and career development processes. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 39% of our employees were women. Our employees are based in three main offices located in Pesaro, Milan and Campobasso as well as seven additional main locations in Bologna, Roma, Catania, Mantova, Napoli, Vigonza and Turin. We also maintain development centers in Copenhagen, Denmark; Jaen, Spain; and Tirana, Albania, along with a billing center in Madrid, Spain and an office in Istanbul, Turkey following the acquisition of Mikro in 2023.

This evolution is guided by three strategic pillars: (i) the expansion of our software and digital offerings to unlock new opportunities for recurring revenue, particularly in markets with a fragmented base of small customers; (ii) the consolidation of our position as a leading payment facilitator in the fintech sector; and (iii) the establishment of a strong presence in the data economy. With these objectives in mind, our current R&D strategy is designed to ensure the delivery of solutions that are reliable and secure and at the same time also contemporary and fully responsive to our customers’ needs, enhancing their operational efficiency. At the heart of this strategy is our “One Platform” program, which focuses on developing solutions at the forefront of technological and functional innovation. In particular, our “One Platform” program is a framework that informs the development of our products, ensuring they adhere to a set of defined technology and functional principles. With respect to technological principles, our products are developed as native SaaS applications, supporting multitenancy and multi-cloud environments and are mobile-enabled to cater to the needs of a diverse user base. We prioritize cybersecurity and privacy from the initial design phase, embedding these critical aspects into the fabric of our products to safeguard user data proactively. The products are designed to operate within collaborative platforms, utilizing APIs to facilitate seamless communication and integration with other systems. The “once only” principle is a key aspect of our technology approach, which emphasizes the high adoption of One Platform, aiming to create a unified and efficient experience by developing common components that serve multiple purposes across our product suite. Functionally, our products are set out as digitally based products and incorporate artificial intelligence to enhance their capabilities and provide intelligent insights to users. The design process is governed by considerations of cost, ease of onboarding, retention and maintenance, ensuring that our products are not only advanced but also accessible and sustainable to customers. Engagement and buy-in are critical components of our software philosophy, which is reflected in the interactive and user-friendly nature of our products. Additionally, our products are crafted to foster enhanced collaboration between stakeholders, enabling more effective cooperation and communication. We also pursue a “Dual Track” approach, which involves modernizing our existing products while simultaneously developing next-generation offerings to cater to a wide spectrum of customer requirements and stay at the forefront of market trends. In particular, our dual track product strategy involves offering both cloud-based solutions and on-premise software to meet the diverse needs of our clients. This approach allows us to cater to a wide range of businesses, each with specific customization and complexity requirements, facilitating their migration to cloud-based solutions. ----- Our software products are entirely developed by us, with very few exceptions, which allows us to maintain technical control over the design and development of our products. Our R&D activities include (i) software maintenance and evolution, which refers to activities aimed at performing technical upgrades to our existing products and extending our software functionalities with respect to regulatory and legal updates, which is very important and critical for our customers that require quick responses to frequently changing legislation; and (ii) software innovation, which refers to activities aimed at broadening our product range, extending current functional coverage and introducing new functionalities, entering new market segments and improving our products from a technical, architectural, user experience and security standpoint, with the goal of providing increasingly comprehensive software solutions to customers in a range of markets with different requirements. In particular, we deliver software innovation both internally and through our acquisitions and we have made substantial investments in research and software product development, including to evolve our core ERP products towards state-of-art technology, software architecture, user experience and interface, build our cloud-native offer across all product lines, launching both the cloud-native versions of our core ERP solutions as well as brand-new cloud software, and create our digital ecosystem, that enables extended collaboration among our products and create our wide range of digital products, fully integrated to both our on premise and cloud native software. Finally, our new way of working, known as “One RnD,” is designed to foster innovation and adaptability in response to current and future business needs. As part of this strategy, we have distinguished the roles of Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer to ensure a balanced approach to product development and technological innovation. The product roadmaps are of each business unit, which aligns them with specific market needs, while central coordination ensures consistency and coherence across our entire platform. By treating our platform as a product, we focus energy and resources on enhancing its core capabilities. This approach reinforces the platform’s importance and ensures continuous improvement and innovation. Our operating model and organizational structure are based on scaled agile methodologies. This framework is designed to be consistent and harmonious, enabling quick adaptation to changing market demands and technological advancements. In addition, we have established specialized competence centers to concentrate critical skills and ensure a unified vision and goal. These centers focus on areas such as UX/UI design, data and AI and cybersecurity, driving excellence and innovation. Finally, “One RnD” emphasizes attracting and growing talent, creating an environment that encourages the sharing and cross-fertilization of knowledge and best practices. This approach ensures that our organization continuously evolves and improves through collaborative learning and innovation. Development costs are generally expensed in our results of operations, with the exception of our development costs related to new product developments, which are capitalized. Capitalized development costs were €13.1 million, €17.2 million and €23.2 million in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively and €27.3 million for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024.

Our policy is to protect all of our significant technologies by seeking trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights and, where required, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. In addition, we have implemented a variety of practical measures aimed at providing additional security for our intellectual property. For example, we include non-compete and non-solicitation clauses in the contracts of our key employees and in the acquisition agreements with our strategic partners relating to our majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, we use repositories for our source code, which may be accessed only by authorized individuals and only in certain circumstances. Moreover, we have developed certain contingency and disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of these types of events. We believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of assistance services.

Our dedicated customer service unit is organized by product type. All of our customers, including our VARs, have access to a web portal through which they can submit their requests of assistance. Through this web portal, our customer service team is able to prioritize and manage the requests and, based on the level of complexity and type of request, assign them to an expert team. After an initial assessment and, in case of simple requests, a first answer via email, our customer support services are delivered by telephone conference between the customer and one of our customer support representatives. If the technical problem that customer is experiencing is related to the software and requires a structural intervention on the product, our customer support representatives forward the call to our research and development department. In addition, we maintain an online knowledge database, accessible by all of our customers and VARs through the same web portal that is designed to answer common and basic inquiries related to our products. Customers who access the database can find information such as software instruction manuals, video instructions and advanced search engines for Frequently Asked Questions (“FAQ”) documents. We have outsourced a small part of our customer support operations to Comdata Group S.p.A. to help us more efficiently manage increased assistance requests from our customers during peak times, such as the final window before a regulatory deadline (including tax filings). Currently, all customer assistance requests are received by our web portal and managed through a unified call center, which allocates the requests to our internal and external customer support representatives based on a variety of factors, including the current capacity of our internal and external teams. Since 2018, we have created a customer retention team, which deals with retention activities in every customer segment. Our customer retention team re-negotiates service levels and other aspects of existing customer contracts to reduce churn after customers submit a contract termination notice. The creation of this team is part of our “Customer Success” initiative, which includes a number of activities to facilitate customer centricity, redesign and optimize the customer journey and improve customer satisfaction, which, in turn, increase our retention rate. In 2020, we started to offer to a selected number of VARs the possibility to collaborate with our customer retention team to manage cancellations requests from their end-customers. Mainly in our Enterprise Solutions and Professional Solutions business units, VARs provide customer service and other assistance services directly to the end-customers, whereas we remain in charge of software maintenance services. VARs independently provide their customers with a dedicated assistance service similar to the assistance we provide to our end-customers. When requested, we provide second-level assistance to the VARs on complex technical matters, requiring intervention on the software, through a dedicated unit within our customer service team. This department provides VARs with assistance for (i) technical and product error reporting and resolution, (ii) online access to a database of error reports, (iii) product updates and new releases and (iv) new versions and product corrections. In addition, VARs have access to our online knowledge database containing software instruction manuals and FAQ documents. We also offer technical training courses to our VARs on our products and on commercial, technical and managerial best practices. In order to ensure that the quality of the services delivered to end-customers is consistent with the high standards we strive to offer, we developed VAR certification programs whereby each VAR must undergo a specific training course and pass a test in order to be certified for the resale of each of our product lines. Without this certification, a VAR is not authorized to sell our products.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at a rate per annum computed against the principal outstanding on the Notes (the “Applicable Rate”), reset quarterly, equal to the sum of (i) three-month EURIBOR (and if that rate is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero) plus (ii)          %, as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined below).

The Parent Guarantor also guarantees or will guarantee, as applicable, on a senior basis the 2021 Senior Secured Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor will rank _pari passu with the Parent Guarantor’s obligations, as issuer, under the Existing PIK Notes and, once issued, the_ PIK Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, the Issuer accounted for 79.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s consolidated total assets, and generated 54.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s total revenue and 47.6% of the TeamSystem Group’s Adjusted EBITDA, after the elimination of intercompany balances. As of March 31, 2024, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, the Parent Guarantor would have had €300.0 million of external third-party financial indebtedness, consisting of the PIK Notes. As described below under “—Certain covenants—Additional Guarantees” and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees the Revolving Credit Facility, Public Debt or certain other Indebtedness, in each case of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor, shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Notes and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. For the purposes of this “Description of Notes,” “Guarantor” means the Parent Guarantor and any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that may guarantee the Notes from time to time pursuant to the Indenture (each a “Subsidiary Guarantor”) on or after the Issue Date (in each case, together with any and all successors thereto). The obligations of a Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent the relevant Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance, preference, transfer at under value or unlawful financial assistance under applicable law, or otherwise to reflect corporate benefit rules, thin capitalization rules, retention of title claims, laws on the preservation of share capital, limitations of corporate law, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally or other limitations under applicable law which, among other things, might limit the amount that can be guaranteed by each relevant Guarantor. Additionally, the Guarantees will be subject to certain corporate law procedures being complied with. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Collateral and certain insolvency law considerations” and “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—The Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit their validity and enforceability” and “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws, capital maintenance and other limitations on the Guarantee and the Collateral may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantee and the Collateral.” The Guarantees will be_ further limited as required under the Agreed Security Principles that apply or will apply, as applicable, to, and restrict the granting of guarantees and security in favor of obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes, which provide and will provide, among other things, that no guarantees or security will be required if any such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements. By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee will be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. On the Issue Date and subject to the covenant described below under “—Certain covenants—Additional _Guarantees,” none of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer is expected to guarantee the Notes, and the Notes will therefore_ be structurally subordinated to any existing or future indebtedness or obligations of each of the Subsidiaries of the Issuer. Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries, including trade creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those Restricted Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of those Restricted Subsidiaries and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Restricted Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors ----- of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders. The Notes and each Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer (other than the Guarantors) and minority stockholders of non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiaries.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness of Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture will not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Indenture, including the Liabilities to Non-Controlling Shareholders of Subsidiaries.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent the Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, the Issuer shall publish notices relating to a Change of Control on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com), to the extent and in the manner permitted by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Such notice may also be published in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the Luxemburger Wort) or by other methods considered as equivalent by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer or repurchase any Notes as described under this heading “—Change of Control” upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (2) a notice of redemption with respect to each series of Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as defined under “—Optional redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, ----- a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place providing for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such third-party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC (or its Division of Corporation Finance) will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of control under the Revolving Credit Facility and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources and whether its Restricted Subsidiaries are permitted to distribute funds to the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes—The Issuer may not be able to _repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer. In addition, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even if certain holders do not consent to the tender.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if the Total Remuneration at any time exceeds the maximum remuneration permitted under applicable Italian law (including Italian Law No. 108 of March 7, 1996, as amended and supplemented), then the Total Remuneration shall immediately and automatically be reduced to the maximum admissible remuneration pursuant to applicable Italian law for, and limited to, the period during which it is not possible to apply the remuneration as originally provided; provided that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Notes is permitted under applicable law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any such compliance.

The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year (beginning with the first fiscal year ending after the Issue Date), an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Indenture provides for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction.

If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements as discussed in “Transfer _restrictions.”_ Transfers of Restricted Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Restricted Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions contained in the legend appearing on the face of the Rule 144A Global Note, as set forth in “Transfer restrictions.” Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Restricted Book-Entry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest. In the event additional Notes of any series are issued pursuant to Regulation S that bear the same ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number as Notes belonging to the same series previously issued, without being fungible with such series of initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes that form part of that series (including in respect of investors that hold Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of such series on or prior to the date of issuance of such additional Notes) will not be eligible for transfer to Book-Entry Interests in a Rule 144A Global Note (if any) representing Notes of that same series. Such a restriction could adversely impact the liquidity of sales of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes of such series of Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks _related to the Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—Additional Notes sold pursuant to Regulation S may not_ ----- _be fungible with existing Notes of the relevant series for U.S. federal income tax purposes” and “Description of Notes—Additional Notes.”_ Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under “Description of Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

The Issuer may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

Interest will be included in the relevant beneficial owner’s Italian income tax return and will be subject to Italian ordinary income taxation and the imposta sostitutiva may be recovered as a deduction from Italian income tax due. Where a Noteholder is an Italian-resident company or similar commercial entity, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident company to which the Notes are effectively connected, and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest from the Notes will not be subject to the _imposta sostitutiva. Interest must, however, be included in the relevant Noteholder’s income tax return and is therefore subject to general Italian corporate income taxation (i.e. IRES and, if applicable, any relevant additional surcharge, such as the additional 3.5% surcharge for banks and certain financial institutions) and, in certain circumstances, depending on the status of the Noteholder and also to the Italian regional tax on productive activities (“IRAP”) (i.e., generally in the case of banks and financial institutions). _Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_ Payments of Interest deriving from the Notes made to Italian resident real estate investment funds and real estate closed-ended investment companies (società di investimento a capitale fisso, or “SICAFs”), provided that the Notes, together with the coupons relating thereto, are timely deposited directly or indirectly with an Italian authorized financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediary) are subject neither to imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at the level of the real estate investment fund or the real estate SICAF. However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real ----- estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders or shareholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. _Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_ If an Italian resident Noteholder is a non-real estate open-ended or a closed-ended collective investment fund (“Fund”) or an open-ended investment company (società di investimento a capitale variabile, or “SICAVs”) or a non-real estate SICAF established in Italy and either (i) the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF or (ii) their manager is subject to the supervision of a regulatory authority and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary, interest accrued during the holding period on the Notes will not be subject to _imposta _sostitutiva, but must be included in the management results of the Fund, the SICAV or the non-real estate SICAF._ The Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV are subject neither to _imposta sostitutiva nor to any other income tax at their level, but a withholding tax of 26% will be levied, in certain circumstances, by the Fund, the non-real estate SICAF or the SICAV on proceeds distributed in favor of their unitholders or shareholders. _Pension funds_ If an Italian resident Noteholder is a pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) and the Notes are deposited with an authorized intermediary, Interest relating to the Notes and accrued during the holding period will not be subject to imposta sostitutiva, but must be included in the results of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the tax period (which will be subject to a 20% substitute tax). Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, interest, premium and other income relating to the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo _termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian law. Application of the imposta sostitutiva_ Pursuant to Decree No. 239, the _imposta sostitutiva_ is applied by banks, brokerage companies (società di intermediazione mobiliare, or “SIM”), fiduciary companies, società di gestione del risparmio (“SGR”), stockbrokers and other entities identified by decrees of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (each, an “Intermediary”). An Intermediary must: (a) be resident in Italy or be a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary; and (b) participate, in any way, in the collection of Interest or in the transfer of the Notes. For the purpose of the application of the _imposta sostitutiva, a transfer of Notes includes any assignment or other act, either with or without consideration, which results in a change in ownership of the relevant Notes or in a change in the Intermediary with which the Notes are deposited. If the Notes are not deposited with an Intermediary, the imposta sostitutiva is applied and withheld by the relevant Italian financial intermediary (or permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident financial intermediary) paying the Interest to a Noteholder or, absent that, by the Issuer and gross recipients that are Italian resident corporations or permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident corporations to which the Notes are effectively connected are entitled to deduct imposta sostitutiva suffered from income taxes due. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ If the Noteholder is a non-Italian resident for tax purposes (without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected), an exemption from the _imposta sostitutiva_ applies, provided that the non-Italian resident Noteholder is: (a) a beneficial owner of the payment of Interest and resident, for tax purposes, in a state or territory included in the White List; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or ----- (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must promptly deposit the Notes together with the coupons relating to such Notes directly or indirectly with: (1) an Italian or non-Italian resident bank or financial institution (there is no requirement for the bank or financial institution to be an EU resident) (the “First Level Bank”), acting as intermediary in the deposit of the Notes held, directly or indirectly, by the Noteholder with a Second Level Bank (as defined below); or (2) an Italian resident bank or SIM, or a permanent establishment in Italy of a non-Italian resident bank or SIM, acting as depositary or sub-depositary of the Notes appointed to maintain direct relationships, via telematic link, with the Department of Revenue of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (the “Second",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Where an Italian-resident Noteholder is an individual not_ engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, any capital gain realized by such Noteholder from the sale or redemption of the Notes would be subject to a capital gain tax (imposta sostitutiva, or “CGT”) levied at a rate of 26%. Noteholders may set off any capital losses with their capital gains. ----- In respect of the application of the imposta sostitutiva, taxpayers may opt—under certain conditions—for any of the three regimes described below. _Tax return regime (Regime della dichiarazione). Under the tax return regime, which is the default regime for_ Italian resident individuals not engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected, the CGT on capital gains will be chargeable, on a cumulative basis, on all capital gains (net of any incurred capital loss) realized by the Italian resident individual holding the Notes during any given tax year. Italian resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity must indicate the overall capital gains realized in any tax year, net of any relevant incurred capital loss, in their annual tax return, and pay the CGT on such gains, together with any balance of income tax due for such year. Within the same time limit, capital losses in excess of capital gains may be carried forward against capital gains realized in any of the four succeeding tax years. _Nondiscretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Amministrato Regime). As an alternative to the tax_ return regime, Italian-resident individual Noteholders holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity may elect to pay the CGT separately on capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (regime del risparmio amministrato). Such separate taxation of capital gains is allowed subject to: - the Notes being deposited with an Italian bank, SIM or certain authorized financial intermediaries (including permanent establishments in Italy of non-Italian resident intermediaries); and - an express election for the risparmio amministrato regime being made in writing in a timely fashion by the relevant Noteholder. The depository must account for the CGT in respect of capital gains realized on each sale or redemption of the Notes (as well as in respect of capital gains realized upon the revocation of its mandate), net of any incurred capital loss. The depository must also pay the CGT to the Italian tax authorities on behalf of the Noteholder, deducting a corresponding amount from the proceeds to be credited to the Noteholder or using funds provided by the Noteholder for this purpose. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, any possible capital loss resulting from a sale or redemption or certain other transfer of the Notes may be deducted from capital gains subsequently realized, within the same securities management, in the same tax year or in the following tax years, up until the fourth tax year. Under the risparmio amministrato regime, the Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains/losses realized within said regime in the annual tax return. _Discretionary investment portfolio regime (Risparmio Gestito Regime)._ In the _Risparmio Gestito Regime, any_ capital gains realized by Italian-resident individuals holding the Notes not in connection with an entrepreneurial activity and who have entrusted the management of their financial assets (including the Notes) to an authorized intermediary, will be included in the computation of the annual increase in value of the managed assets accrued, even if not realized, at tax year-end, subject to a 26% substitute tax, to be paid by the managing authorized intermediary. Any decrease in value of the managed assets accrued at the tax year-end may be carried forward against any increase in value of the managed assets accrued in any of the four succeeding tax years. The Noteholder is not required to declare the capital gains or losses realized within said regime in its annual tax return. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be exempt from any income taxation (including from the 26% CGT) if the Noteholders are Italian resident individuals not engaged in entrepreneurial activity or social security entities pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 509 of June 30, 1994 and Legislative Decree No. 103 of February 10, 1996 and the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets all the requirements set forth under Italian law. _Noteholders engaged in an entrepreneurial activity_ Any gain obtained from the sale or redemption of the Notes will be treated as part of taxable business income (and, in certain circumstances, depending on the “status” of the Noteholder, also as part of net value of the production for IRAP purposes), if realized by an Italian company, a similar commercial entity (including the Italian permanent establishment of non-Italian resident entities to which the Notes are connected) or Italian resident individuals engaged in an entrepreneurial activity to which the Notes are connected. _Real estate investment funds and real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian real estate investment fund or an Italian real estate SICAF will be subject neither to CGT nor to any income tax at the level of the real estate investment ----- fund or the Real Estate SICAF (see “Tax treatment of interest—Real estate investment funds and real estate _SICAFs”). However, a withholding or substitute tax of 26% will apply, in certain circumstances, to income_ realized by unitholders or shareholders in the event of distributions, redemption or sale of the units or shares. Moreover, subject to certain conditions, income realized by Italian real estate investment funds or real estate SICAFs is attributed pro rata to the Italian resident unitholders irrespective of any actual distribution on a tax transparency basis. _Funds, SICAVs and non-real estate SICAFs_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which is a Fund, a SICAF (other than a real estate SICAF) or a SICAV will not be subject to CGT but will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant fiscal year. Such result will not be taxed at the level of the Fund, the SICAF or the SICAV, but income realized by the unitholders or shareholders in case of distributions, redemption or sale of the units / shares may be subject to a withholding tax of 26%. _Pension funds_ Any capital gains realized by a Noteholder which qualifies as an Italian pension fund (subject to the regime provided for by Article 17 of Legislative Decree No. 252 of December 5, 2005) will be included in the result of the relevant portfolio accrued at the end of the relevant tax period, and subject to 20% substitute tax. Subject to certain conditions (including minimum holding period requirement) and limitations, capital gains on the Notes may be excluded from the taxable base of the 20% substitute tax if the Notes are included in a long-term savings account (piano di risparmio a lungo termine) that meets the requirements set forth under Italian law. _Non-Italian resident Noteholders_ A 26% CGT on capital gains may be payable on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of the Notes by non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected, if the Notes are held in Italy. However, under Article 23(1)(f)(2) of Decree No. 917, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also certain multilateral trading facilities) in Italy or abroad are not subject to the CGT, subject to the filing of required documentation in a timely fashion (in particular, a self-declaration that the Noteholder is not resident in Italy for tax purposes and has no permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected). Capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer, even if the Notes are not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), are not subject to the CGT, provided that the beneficial owner is: (a) a resident, for tax purposes, of a state or territory included in the White List; or (b) an international body or entity set up in accordance with international agreements which have entered into force in Italy; or (c) an “institutional investor,” whether or not subject to tax, which is established in a state or territory included in the White List, even if it does not possess the status of a taxpayer in its own state of establishment; or (d) a central bank or an entity which manages, inter alia, the official reserves of a foreign state. In order to ensure gross payment, non-Italian resident Noteholders must satisfy the same conditions set forth above to benefit from the exemption from the _imposta sostitutiva_ in accordance with Decree No. 239 (see “—Tax _treatment of interest”)._ If none of the above conditions is met, capital gains realized by non-Italian resident Noteholders from the sale or the redemption of Notes issued by an Italian resident issuer and not traded on regulated markets (which term includes, for these purposes, also multilateral trading facilities), may be subject to the CGT at the current rate of 26%. However, Noteholders might benefit from an applicable tax treaty with Italy, providing that capital gains ----- realized upon the sale or redemption of the Notes are to be taxed only in the State where the recipient is tax resident, subject to certain conditions to be satisfied. Under these circumstances, if non-Italian resident persons without a permanent establishment in Italy to which the Notes are effectively connected hold Notes with an Italian authorized financial intermediary and are subject to the risparmio amministrato regime or elect for the risparmio gestito regime, exemption from Italian taxation on capital gains will apply upon condition that the non-Italian residents Noteholders file in time with the authorized financial intermediary appropriate documents which include, inter alia, a certificate of residence from the competent tax authorities of their country of residence. The risparmio amministrato regime is the ordinary regime automatically applicable to non-Italian resident persons and entities holding Notes deposited with an Intermediary, but non-Italian resident Noteholders retain the right to waive this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the alternative minimum tax or the unearned income Medicare contribution tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, individual retirement accounts, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass through entities or arrangements and investors therein, U.S. holders that are resident in or have a permanent establishment in a jurisdiction outside the United States persons holding the Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction and holders and beneficial owners of the Existing Private Notes or the Existing Floating Rate Notes.

A payment is not treated as a contingent payment under these Treasury Regulations if, as of the issue date of the debt instrument, the likelihood that such payment will be made is remote and/or the payments are incidental. In certain circumstances (see, for example, “Description of Notes— _Withholding taxes” and “Description of Notes—Change of Control”), the Issuer may be obligated to redeem the_ Notes for an amount less than their stated principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may be obligated to redeem the Notes or to make certain payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. The Issuer believes that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments due to the possibility of such a redemption occurring or such excess payments being made. The Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate different than their yield to maturity and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognized on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a payment of stated interest on the Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes (or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt) will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the amount of stated interest income in euro that has accrued with respect to its Notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of such euro denominated accrued interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the partial period within each taxable year. An ----- accrual basis U.S. holder may elect, however, to translate such accrued interest income into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued interest, a U.S. holder that has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such interest at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt of the interest. The above election will apply to other debt instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize exchange gain or loss with respect to accrued interest income on the date such interest is received.

In the event the Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of such Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds its issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event that the Notes are issued with OID, the amount of OID with respect to a Note of such series includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. For the purposes of determining OID accruals and adjusted issue price only, the amounts of stated interest and OID on the Notes are determined by assuming that the interest rate on the Notes is a fixed rate based on the value of the floating rate applicable to the Notes as of the issue date. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of _stated interest.”_ A U.S. holder will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of a Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the euro payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules. ----- Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Certain Treasury Regulations that apply to non-U.S. income taxes paid or accrued in taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 further restrict the ability of any such credit based on the nature of the tax imposed by the non-U.S. jurisdiction, although the IRS has provided temporary relief from the application of certain aspects of these regulations until new guidance or regulations are issued.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of such Note to such U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such U.S. holder with respect to the Note. The cost of a Note purchased with euro generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price translated at the spot rate on the date of purchase. If the applicable Note is treated as traded on an established securities market and the relevant U.S. holder is either a cash basis taxpayer or an accrual basis taxpayer who has made the special election described below, such U.S. holder will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of such Note by translating the amount paid at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. If a U.S. holder receives euro on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, the amount realized generally will be based on the U.S. dollar value of such euro translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of such taxable disposition. In the case of a Note that is considered to be traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. holder and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. holder, will determine the U.S. dollar value of such euro by translating such amount at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the disposition. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. holders in regard to the purchase or disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the principal amount of such Note generally will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income or expense. Such gain or loss generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder disposes of the Note, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s euro purchase price for the Note, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Note. In addition, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder may recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and OID, if any, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of stated interest” or “—Original issue _discount,” as applicable.

The Initial Purchasers are Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE, BofA Securities Europe SA, Barclays Bank Ireland PLC, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., J.P. Morgan SE, Mediobanca – Banca di Credito Finanziario S.p.A., Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc, Nomura Financial Products Europe GmbH, UBS Europe SE and UniCredit Bank GmbH. The obligations of the Initial Purchasers under the Purchase Agreement, including their agreement to purchase Notes from us, are several and not joint. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers will purchase all of the Notes being sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement if any of them are purchased. If an Initial Purchaser defaults, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may be increased or the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Initial Purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. None of the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor will for a period of 60 days after the Issue Date, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except the Notes and the Guarantee thereof and the PIK Notes, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries that are substantially similar to the Notes without the prior written consent of the representatives under the Purchase Agreement. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the respective issue prices indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of each series of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Notes and the Guarantee have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has agreed that: - The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act or in transactions not subject to those registration requirements; and - During the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons they reasonably believe to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. Until 40 days after the later of (i) the commencement of this Offering and (ii) the issue date of the Notes, an offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or another exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation S. Resales of the Notes are restricted as described under “Important information” and “Notice to investors.” In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that: - it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) received by it in connection with the issue ----- or sale of the Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 does not apply to the Issuer or the Parent Guarantor; - it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 with respect to anything done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and - to the extent it is also a “Manufacturer,” as defined in MiFID II, it has not offered, sold, distributed or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell, distribute or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the European Economic Area in compliance with the applicable provisions of MiFID II, the Insurance Distribution Directive or the Prospectus Regulation relating to the offer and sale of securities to retail investors. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation and, in Italy, Article 100 of the Italian Financial Act, and implementing regulations by CONSOB, including Regulation 20307, Article 34-ter, first paragraph, letter (b) of the Issuer Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling any in scope securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is eligible counterparties (“ECP”) and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to ECPs and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been or will be prepared. Offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the COBS, and professional clients only, each as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes may ----- be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Transfer restrictions.” The Issuer has also agreed that it will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. It is expected that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the Issue Date as specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the            business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement being herein referred to as “T+           ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-l under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trades expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of pricing or the next            succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in T+          , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Transfer _restrictions.” The Issuer will apply to list the Notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and_ to have the Notes admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market thereof, however, the Issuer cannot assure you that such listing will be accepted or maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Issuer cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Notes or that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the _Notes, the Guarantees and the Collateral—There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.” To the extent that any Initial Purchaser that is not a U.S. registered_ broker dealer intends to effect any sales of the Notes in the United States, it will do so through one or more U.S. registered broker dealer affiliates as permitted by guidelines promulgated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit the Initial Purchasers to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been ----- completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes or cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. Neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation that the Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice. If the Stabilizing Manager engages in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time, but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past, provide currently and may provide in the future, commercial lending and banking, investment banking, hedging, consulting and financial advisory services to the Parent Guarantor, Issuer and their subsidiaries and affiliates for which they have received, and in the future may receive, customary fees, commissions and expenses. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders or agents under the Revolving Credit Facility and certain of their affiliates may hold the Existing Floating Rate Notes, Existing Fixed Rate Notes and the Existing Private Notes. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to redeem the Existing Private Notes (as described under “Use of proceeds”) and, to the extent that the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates hold the Existing Private Notes, they will receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will also act as mandated lead arrangers and/or lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacities. Affiliates of an Initial Purchaser have committed to invest in securities of an affiliate of the Issuer. Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own account. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer or Issuer’s affiliates (including the Notes). Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Issuer may hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchaser and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities (including potentially the Notes). Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Funds and/or other investment vehicles advised by affiliates of any of the principal shareholders may place a purchase order for and be allocated Notes at a purchase price per Note equal to the relevant issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Furthermore, although the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor will appoint an agent for service of process in the United States and will submit to the jurisdiction of New York courts, in each case, in connection with any action in relation to the Notes and the Indenture or under U.S. securities laws, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process on such persons as mentioned above within the United States in any action, including actions predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws.

The determination of where a company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact_ on which the courts of the different EU Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the “centre of main interests” of a company is presumed to be in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. This presumption only applies if the registered office has not been moved to another member state of the European Union within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation states that “it should be possible to rebut this presumption where _the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third-parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in_ determining the “centre of main interests” of a company, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. A company’s “centre of main interests” may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition unless (as set forth above) the registered office has been moved within the three-month period prior to the filing of the insolvency petition. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings. The EU Insolvency Regulation applies to insolvency proceedings which are collective insolvency proceedings of the types referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a company is, at the time an insolvency application is made in one member state of the European Union (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation the courts of another member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open (subject to certain exceptions) secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings against that company only if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other member state of the European Union. Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the EU Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the company carries out or has carried out in the ----- three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other member state of the European Union. Where main proceedings in the member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) in which the company has its centre of main interests have not yet been opened, territorial insolvency proceedings can be opened in another member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) where the company has an establishment only where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be opened in the member state of the European Union in which the company’s centre of main interests is situated under that member state of the European Union law, or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are opened at the request of (i) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of the establishment situated within the territory of the member state of the European Union where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested or (ii) a public authority which, under the law of the member state of the European Union within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the _lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the company. The courts of all member states of the European Union (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court opening the main proceedings (subject to any public policy exceptions), which will be given the same effect in the other member states of the European Union (other than Denmark) so long as no secondary proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been opened there and subject to certain other exceptions (for instance, rights in rem situated in another member state of the European Union remain subject to the original law governing that right). The insolvency practitioner appointed or confirmed by a court in a member state of the European Union which has jurisdiction to open main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on him by the law of that member state of the European Union in another member state of the European Union (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the company from that other member state of the European Union) subject to certain limitations (for instance, the powers are available so long as no insolvency proceedings have been opened in that other member state of the European Union or any preservation measure taken to the contrary further to a request to open insolvency proceedings in that other member state of the European Union where the company has assets). If the company does not have an establishment in any other member state of the European Union, the court of the other member state of the European Union has jurisdiction to open secondary/territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the European Union Insolvency Regulation. The courts of all the member states of the European Union (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other member states of the European Union so long as no secondary or territorial proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a member state of the European Union which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the company’s centre of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that member state of the European Union in another member state of the European Union (such as to remove assets of the company from that other member state of the European Union) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other member state of the European Union or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other member state of the European Union where the company has assets. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the EU Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering communication and efficiency in the insolvency proceeding of several members of a group of companies opened in one or more member states of the European Union (other than Denmark). Under Article 61 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation in group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuer and the Guarantors. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The concept of real and adequate benefit is not defined in the applicable legislation; it is assessed and determined by a factual analysis on a case by case basis and its existence is a business decision of the directors and the statutory auditors, if any. As a general rule, corporate benefit is to be assessed at the level of the relevant company on a stand-alone basis, although upon certain circumstances and subject to specific rules the interest of the group to which such company belongs may also be taken into consideration. While corporate benefit for downstream guarantee or security (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries of the relevant grantor) is usually self-evident, the validity and effectiveness of up-stream or cross stream security or guarantee (i.e., a guarantee guaranteeing or a security interest granted to secure financial obligations of the direct or indirect parent or sister companies of the relevant grantor) granted by an entity incorporated under the laws of Italy depend on the existence of a real and adequate benefit in exchange for the granted security interest or guarantee and may be challenged unless it can be proved that the grantor may derive adequate benefits or advantages from the granting of such guarantee or security. In particular, in case of an up-stream and cross-stream guarantee or security for the financial obligations of group companies, examples may include financial consideration in the form of access to cash flows through intercompany loans from other members of the group (without duplication), while transactions featuring debt financings of distributions to shareholders are largely untested in Italian courts, and, therefore, limited guidance is provided as to whether and to what extent such transactions could be challenged for lack of corporate benefit and conflict of interest. The general rule is that, the risk assumed by an Italian grantor of security or guarantor under a guarantee must not be disproportionate to the direct or indirect economic benefit to it. As a general rule, absence of a real and adequate benefit could render the transaction (including granting a security interest or a guarantee entered into) by an Italian company _ultra vires and potentially affected by a conflict of interest and the related corporate resolutions adopted by the shareholders and directors may be the subject matter of challenges and annulment. Civil liabilities may be imposed on the directors of an Italian grantor if a court holds that it did not act in the best interest of the grantor and that the acts carried out do not fall within the corporate purpose of the company or were against mandatory provisions of Italian law. The lack of corporate benefit could also result in the imposition of civil liabilities on those companies or persons ultimately exercising control over an Italian grantor or having knowingly received an advantage or profit from such improper control. Moreover, the transaction (including the security interest or guarantee granted by an Italian company) could be declared null and void if the lack of corporate benefit was known or presumed to be known by the third party and such third party acted intentionally against the interest of the Italian company. The above principles on corporate benefit apply equally to up-stream, cross-stream and down-stream guarantees or security interests granted by Italian companies. Upon certain conditions, the granting of guarantees may be considered as a restricted financial activity within the meaning of Article 106 of Italian Legislative Decree No. 385 of September 1, 1993, as amended from time to time and related implementing rules and regulations (the “Italian Banking Act”), whose exercise is exclusively delegated to banks and authorized financial intermediaries. Non-compliance with the provisions of the Italian Banking Act may, among other things, entail the relevant guarantees being considered null and void. In this respect, Italian Legislative Decree No. 53 of April 2, 2015, implementing Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Italian Banking Act, states that the issuance of guarantees or the granting of security by a company for the obligations of another company which is part of the same group does not qualify as a restricted financial activity, whereby “group” includes controlling and controlled companies within the meaning of Article 2359 of the Italian Civil Code as well as companies which are under the control of the same entity. As a result of the above described rules, ----- subject to the relevant guarantors and the guaranteed entity being part of the same group of companies, the provision of the guarantees would not amount to a restricted financial activity.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Under such provision (introduced by Italian Law No. 164 of November 11, 2014), the security interests and guarantees assisting bond issuances can be validly created in favor of the holders of the notes or in favor of a representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes who will then be entitled to exercise in the name and on behalf of the holders all their rights (including any rights before any court and judicial proceedings) relating to the security interests and guarantees. However, there is no guidance or available case law on the exercise of the rights and enforcement of such security interest and guarantees by a rappresentante pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code also in the name and on behalf the holders of the Notes which are neither directly parties to the Collateral nor are specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries. In addition, as the holders of the Notes are not direct parties to the Indenture, there is the risk that the appointment of the Security Agent in its capacity as representative (rappresentante) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code is not upheld by an Italian court and that therefore an Italian court may determine that the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the security under the Security Documents and/or that the rappresentante cannot exercise the rights and enforce the Collateral also in the name and on behalf of the holders of the Notes. In addition, the provisions and the subject matter of paragraph 3 of Article 2414-bis, paragraph 3, of the Italian Civil Code are new and, as such, untested by Italian Courts and, therefore, even if the appointment of the rappresentante is upheld by an Italian Court, it cannot be excluded that an Italian Court may take a different view and interpretation and determine that, where the Collateral is granted in favor of the rappresentante, the holders of the Notes at the time of enforcement are not secured by the Collateral and/or cannot enforce that Collateral. Furthermore, to date, the Italian courts have not considered whether a common representative (rappresentante _comune) of the holders of the Notes pursuant to Articles 2417 and 2418 of the Italian Civil Code may be validly_ appointed by means of a contractual arrangement (such as the Indenture) and the validity and enforceability of such appointment may not be upheld by a court. Moreover, it is uncertain and untested in the Italian courts whether, under Italian law, a security interest can be created and perfected: (i) in favor of creditors (such as the holders of the Notes) which are neither directly parties to the relevant security documents or are not specifically identified therein or in the relevant share certificates and corporate documents or public registries; and (ii) in favor of a “trustee,” since there is no established concept of “trust” or “trustee” under Italian law and the precise nature, effect and enforceability of the duties, rights and powers of a “trustee” as trustee under security interests granted over Italian assets is uncertain under Italian law. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In this respect, in case of a loan to a company made by (i) a person that, directly or indirectly, directs the company or exercises management and coordination powers over that borrowing company or (ii) any entity subject to the management and coordination powers of the same person or (iii) a quotaholder in the case of a company incorporated in Italy as a società a responsabilità limitata, will be subordinated to all other creditors of that borrower and rank senior only to the equity in that borrower, if the loan is made when, taking into account the kind of business of the borrower, there was an excessive imbalance of the borrower’s indebtedness compared to its net assets or the borrower was already in a financial situation requiring an injection of equity and not a loan (“undercapitalization”). Pursuant to article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below), any payment made by the borrower with respect to any such loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration are ineffective by operation of law. The new provision replaced article 2467, paragraph 1, of the Italian Civil Code, according to which such payments would be required to be returned to the borrower. For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of claw back actions in an insolvency scenario, see “Certain Italian Insolvency Laws _Considerations—Judicial Liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale)” and “Hardening Period/Clawback and Fraudulent Transfer” below. In addition to that, Article 292, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code sets forth_ that claims of entities exercising management and coordination powers vis-à-vis the entities subject to such powers and claims of the entities subject to such powers vis-à-vis the entities exercising them deriving from loans granted after the filing of petitions resulting in the opening of judicial winding up of in the year before, are subordinated. The above rules apply to shareholders’ loans “made in any form” and scholars generally conclude that such provisions should be interpreted broadly and apply to any form of financial support provided to a company by its shareholders, either directly or indirectly. As of the date hereof, there are several court precedents interpreting the provisions summarized above. Some of such precedents have held that article 2467 of the Italian Civil Code also applies to companies incorporated as _società per azioni, hence potentially to the borrowers under the intercompany loans that are a società per azioni._ Therefore, upon the occurrence of the requirements provided for by the relevant provisions, Italian courts may apply such provisions of the Italian Civil Code to the Issuer’s relationship with Italian subsidiaries under the relevant intercompany loans. Accordingly, an Italian court may conclude that the obligations of any Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loan are subordinated to all its obligations towards other creditors. Should any of the obligations of any subsidiary under any intercompany loan or note be deemed subordinated to the obligations owed to other creditors by operation of law and senior only to the equity, the Issuer may not be able to recover any amounts under any intercompany loan or note granted to the Italian subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Issuer’s ability to meet its payment obligations under the Notes. Moreover, in circumstances where any obligations of an Italian subsidiary under any intercompany loans or notes is subordinated by operation of law, the ability of the holders of the Notes to recover under any Collateral created over such intercompany loans or notes or any guarantees and/or security interests granted by such Italian subsidiaries may be impaired or restricted.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The two primary goals of the Italian law are first, to maintain employment, and second, to liquidate the debtor’s assets for the satisfaction of creditors. These competing goals often have been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and by ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under Italian law, in the event that an entity becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, guarantees and security interests given by it or by way of a trust or parallel debt obligation could be subject to potential challenges by the appointed bankruptcy or judicial liquidation receiver or by other creditors under the rules of ineffectiveness or avoidance or claw-back of (i) Italian bankruptcy law (i.e. Royal Decree No. 267 of March 16th 1942, as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Italian Bankruptcy Law”) and/or (ii) Italian Insolvency Code (as defined below) and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions made by the debtor during the “suspect period.” For a more detailed explanation of the terms, conditions and consequences of clawback actions in an insolvency scenario, see “—Certain Italian insolvency law considerations” below. If challenged successfully, the guarantee or the security interest may become unenforceable and any amounts ----- received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or guarantee is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related security documents. Furthermore, in the event that the limitations on the guarantee issued by an Italian guarantor apply and/or there are payment obligations under any Notes other than in respect of principal or interest, the noteholders could have a reduced claim against the relevant guarantor. According to Italian law, the enforcement of any claims, obligations, security interest and rights in general may be subject to, among others, the following aspects: - the enforcement of obligations may be limited by the insolvency proceedings listed below relating to or affecting the rights of creditors; - an Italian court will not necessarily grant any specific enforcement or precautionary measures, the availability of which is subject to the discretion of the Court; - with respect to contracts providing for mutual obligations (contratti a prestazioni corrispettive), each party can refuse to perform its obligation if the other party does not perform or does not offer to perform its own obligation thereunder, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Article 1460 of the Italian Civil Code; - claims arising under Italian law governed documents may become barred under the provision of Italian law concerning prescriptions and limitations by the lapse of time (prescrizioni e decadenze) or may be or become subject to a claim of set-off (compensazione) or to counterclaim; - pursuant to Article 1241 of the Italian Civil Code concerning set-off of reciprocal obligations (compensazione), persons who have reciprocal debt obligations may set-off such obligations for the correspondent amount when both such debt obligations have as an object a pecuniary obligation or fungible assets of the same kind and are equally liquid and payable; - where any party to any agreement or instrument is vested with discretion or may determine a matter in its opinion, Italian law may require that such discretion is exercised reasonably or that such opinion is based on reasonable grounds; - the enforceability in Italy of obligations or contractual provisions governed by a foreign law may be limited by the application of Italian overriding mandatory provisions (norme di applicazione necessaria) and by the fact that the relevant provisions of foreign laws may be deemed contrary to Italian public policy principles and there is no case law setting out specific criteria for the application of such legal concepts under Italian law; - there is some possibility that an Italian court could hold that a judgment on a particular agreement or instrument, whether given in an Italian court or elsewhere, would supersede such agreement or instrument to all intents and purposes, so that any obligation thereunder which by its terms would survive such judgment might not be held to do so; - enforcement of obligations may be invalidated by reason of fraud or abuse of the law (abuso del diritto); - the enforceability of an obligation pursuant to the terms set forth in any agreement or instrument may be subject to the interpretation of an Italian court which may carry out such interpretation pursuant to the provisions of Articles 1362 and following of the Italian Civil Code; - any question as to whether or not any provision of any agreement or instrument which is illegal, invalid, not binding, unenforceable or void may be severed from the other provisions thereof in order to save those other provisions would be determined by an Italian court on the basis of the interpretation of intention of the parties, taking also into account the conduct of the parties following the execution of such agreement or instrument (Article 1419 of the Italian Civil Code); - an Italian company, either directly or indirectly, cannot grant loans or provide security interest for the purchase or subscription of its own shares unless the strict requirements provided for the Italian Civil Code are satisfied; ----- - an Italian company must have a specific corporate interest in guaranteeing or securing financial obligations of its parent company or any other companies, whether related or unrelated, such interest being determined by the relevant company on a case-by-case basis; - in case of bankruptcy (filed or pending before July 15th, 2022) or a judicial liquidation, a receiver is appointed by the court to administer the proceeding under the supervision of the court and creditors’ committee and creditors cannot start or continue individual foreclosure actions (including the enforcement of security interests) against the debtor (automatic stay). Furthermore, the sale of the relevant pledged assets is carried out by such receiver unless the pledgee is expressly authorized by the by the court or, in case of judicial liquidation, to have the pledged assets assigned at a fair market value returning any excess to the judicial liquidation estate; the preemption rights (prelazione) granted by a pledge extend to interest accrued in the year in which the date of the relevant seizure/attachment or adjudication in bankruptcy falls (or, in the absence of seizure/ attachment, at the date of the notification of the payment demand (precetto) and extend, moreover, to interest accrued and to accrue thereafter, but only to the extent of legal interest and until the date of the forced sale occurred in the context of the relevant foreclosure proceeding or bankruptcy/ judicial liquidation proceedings; - in order to oppose an assignment to any third party, it will be necessary to notify such assignment to the relevant debtor or make such debtor to accept it by an instrument bearing an undisputable date (data _certa); the priority of such assignment will be determined accordingly. One way of ensuring that a_ document has an indisputable date is that of ensuring that the execution of the relevant document by one of the parties to it is witnessed by a notary who states the date of witnessing on the document; - there could be circumstances in which Italian law would not give effect to provisions concerning advance waivers or forfeitures; - the effectiveness of terms exculpating a party from liability or duties otherwise owed is prevented by Italian law in the event of gross negligence (colpa grave), willful misconduct (dolo) or the violation of mandatory provisions; - penalties and liquidated damages (penali) may be equitably reduced by a court; - any obligation of an Italian company and/or any obligation secured or guaranteed by an Italian company, which is in violation of certain Italian mandatory or public policy rules (including, among others, any obligation to pay: (i) any portion of interest exceeding the thresholds of the interest rate permitted under the Italian Usury Law, and (ii) any portion of interest deriving from any compounding of interest which does not comply with Italian law, including Article 1283 of the Italian Civil Code, according to which, accrued and unpaid interest can be capitalized only after legal proceedings to recover the debt were started or in the event the interest were unpaid and capitalized for not less than six months based on an agreement executed after the relevant maturity date and Article 120 of the Italian Banking Act) may not be enforceable; - if a party to an agreement is aware of the invalidity of that agreement and does not inform the other parties to that agreement of such invalidity, it is liable for the damages suffered by such other parties as a consequence of having relied upon the validity of the agreement; - Italian courts do not necessarily give full effect to an indemnity for the costs of enforcement or litigation; - a security interest does not prevent creditors of the relevant debtor other than the secured creditors from continuing enforcement or enforcement proceedings on the assets secured by the relevant pledge; and - in case of bankruptcy (to the extent applicable after July 15, 2022) or judicial liquidation of the grantor of the pledge over quotas or shares, the assets secured by the pledge could be freely sold to any third party in the context of the relevant bankruptcy proceeding or in case of a judicial liquidation the pledged assets can also be assigned to secured creditors at a fair market value and, as a consequence, the proceeds would be set aside for the prior satisfaction of the pledgee but the pledge would be terminated and, therefore, the latter would lose entitlement to the voting rights on the pledged quotas/shares. In addition, under Italian law, in certain circumstances also in the ordinary course of business, an action can be brought by any creditor of a given debtor within five years from the date in which the latter enters into a guarantee, security, agreement and any other act by which it disposes of any of its assets, in order to seek a claw-back action ----- (azione revocatoria ordinaria) pursuant to Articles 2901 and following of the Italian Civil Code (which results in a declaration of ineffectiveness as to the acting creditor) of the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act that is purported to be prejudicial to the acting creditor’s right of credit. An Italian court could revoke the said guarantee, security, agreement and other act only if it, in addition to the ascertainment of the prejudice, was to make the two following findings: - that the debtor was aware of the prejudice which the act would cause to the rights of the acting creditor, or, if such act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the act was fraudulently designed for the purpose of prejudicing the satisfaction of the claim or credit; and - that, in the case of non-gratuitous acts, the third party involved was aware of said prejudice and, if the act was done prior to the existence of the claim or credit, that the said third party participated in the fraudulent design.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In Italy, courts play a central role in the insolvency process. Moreover, in court procedures may be materially more complex and the enforcement of security interests by creditors in Italy can be more time-consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which holders of the Notes may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Italy, which does not include special provisions applying to banks, insurance and other companies authorized to carry out certain reserved activities nor it provides a comprehensive description of insolvency laws application where publicly owned companies are involved. Insolvency laws and regulations have replaced by a new crisis and insolvency code. In particular, the Italian government approved on January 12, 2019 Legislative Decree No. 14 of January 12, 2019 implementing the guidelines contained in Law No. 155 of October 19, 2017 contending the scheme of a comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters (the “Legislative Decree”), which enacts a new comprehensive legal framework in order to regulate, among others, insolvency matters which came into force on July 15[th] 2022 (so called “Code of Business Crisis and Insolvency”, hereinafter as subsequently amended and supplemented and including Legislative Decree No. 83 of 17 June 2022 implementing the EU Directive 2019/1023, the “Insolvency Code”). The Legislative Decree was published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on February 14, 2019 no. 38—Suppl. Ordinario no. 6. The main innovations introduced by the Italian Insolvency Code include: (i) the elimination of the term “bankrupt” (fallito) due to its negative connotation and the replacement of bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) with a judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale); (ii) a new definition of “state of crisis” (crisi); (iii) the adoption of the same procedural framework in order to ascertain such state of crisis and to access the different restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza della società) provided for by the same Italian Insolvency Code, (iv) a new set of rules concerning_ group restructurings, (v) restrictions to the use of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato _preventivo) in order to favor going concern proceedings; (vi) a new crisis settlement procedure (composizione negoziata della crisi), (vii) jurisdiction of specialized courts over proceedings involving large debtors, (viii) the_ adoption of definition of debtor’s “center of main interest” as provided in the new set of rules concerning group restructurings, (ix) the introduction of the new restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) among the restructuring tools and frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza della società), (x) the regulation of adequate measures and plans to early_ detect a crisis with specific criteria to be adopted by companies, and (xi) amendments to certain provisions of the Italian Civil Code aimed at ensuring the general effectiveness of the reform. The Italian Insolvency Code has been amended and supplemented by, among others, (i) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 147 of October 26, 2020, (ii) the Italian Draft Legislative Decree on “Amendments to the Business Crisis and Insolvency Code, implementing Directive (EU) 2019/1023” approved on March 17, 2022 by the Italian Council of Ministers (Consiglio dei Ministri) and (iii) the Italian Legislative Decree No. 83 of June 17, 2022. Except for minor changes in some provisions of the Italian Civil Code, which already entered into force on March 16, 2019, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entry into force of the Italian Insolvency Code has been initially postponed to September 1, 2021 by the “Decreto liquidità” (i.e., Law Decree No. 23 of April 8, 2020, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on April 8, 2020 and converted in law by the Italian Parliament by the Law No. 40 of June 5, 2020, published in the Gazzetta Ufficiale on June 6, 2020 the “Liquidity Decree”), and is now effective starting from July 15, 2022. ----- Provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law continue to apply only to any filings for proposals of declaration of insolvency procedures and bankruptcy restructuring plans (concordato fallimentare) and any filings seeking for the approval of debt restructuring agreements (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) or for the opening of a composition with creditors proceeding (concordato preventivo) filed or pending before July 15, 2022 (i.e., the effective date of the Italian Insolvency Code). Considering the above, the following is a brief description of certain main aspects of insolvency law in Italy as it stands now and in particular: (i) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the other ancillary applicable regulations in place until July 15, 2022 and (ii) of the Italian Insolvency Code after its entry into force.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The two primary aims of the Italian Bankruptcy Law are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claim as well as, in case of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure, to maintain employment. These competing aims have often been balanced by the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Bankruptcy Law, bankruptcy (fallimento) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a company upon a petition filed by the company itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 5 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet with ordinary means its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, rather than a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a company is insolvent. In cases where a company is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the company, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. In addition to the composizione negoziata della crisi and to the concordato semplificato _per la liquidazione del _patrimonio described below, the following debt restructuring and bankruptcy measures are available under Italian_ law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent companies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The _composizione negoziata della crisi can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore _commerciale) and agricultural (imprenditore agricolo), which are in a distressed situation with reference to their_ assets, their business and/or their finance, such that it is likely that a crisis or insolvency will follow and it is likely that the financial recovery shall occur, notwithstanding the general thresholds for the application of Italian Bankruptcy Law are not met. Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law Decree 118/2021, _inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione negoziata della crisi (i) shall certify that no requests for the admission to a concordato preventivo procedure nor _accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti have been previously filed to the court in such respect and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata della crisi is dismissed, may not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after the aforementioned dismissal. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the _composizione negoziata della crisi may also apply to group of companies, in order to provide for the possibility of the negotiated proceeding to take place in a unitary form. It should be noted that Paragraph 10 of such provision provides for the group companies – at the end of the ----- negotiations – to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 (as set out below) as a whole group or enter separately as single companies into the solutions referred to therein. The composizione negoziata della crisi is commenced by the enterprises, on a voluntary basis only, with the filing of a petition for the appointment of a third-party and an independent expert (the “Expert”) which however, pursuant to Article 23 of the Law Decree 118/2021, is prevented for enterprises having filed to access the procedures, debt restructuring agreements and/or _concordato preventivo, including (i) pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, (ii) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (iii) the procedures of over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14-ter of Law No. 3 of January 27, 2012 (i.e. _procedimenti di composizione della crisi da _sovraindebitamento e di liquidazione del patrimonio) pending such procedures. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Law_ Decree 118/2021 the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. If the Expert finds that there are concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s financial and business situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. If the Expert finds that there are not concrete chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue for up to an additional 180 days (pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 7 of the Law Decree 118/2021) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 7 and/or Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 5, Paragraph 8 of the Law Decree 118/2021, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the telematic platform (piattaforma telematica), and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any), which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for appointment of the Expert, the entrepreneur cannot be declared bankrupt nor insolvent by the court. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), he must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. ----- The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days. The judge, in his or her discretion, may order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. Upon request of the entrepreneur or of one or more creditors, or upon report of the Expert, the Protective Measures and the Interim Measures can be revoked, or their duration can be reduced, if they do not satisfy the purpose of a positive finalization of the negotiations or appear to be disproportionate compared to the prejudice caused to the creditors that file the relevant request. Pursuant to Article 9 of the Law Decree 118/2021, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. When Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures have been granted, the Expert also reports to the court which may revoke such measures or reduce their duration pursuant to Article 7, Paragraph 6 of the Law Decree 118/2021. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, taking into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect the interests of all relevant parties involved. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021, the _composizione negoziata della crisi can terminate as follow: (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 14 of the Law Decree 118/2021 if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. In such case, the independent expert’s report (attestazione) provided under Article 67, Paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, shall not be required. At the end of the negotiations, the entrepreneur can also file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Article 182-bis, Article 182-septies or Article 182-novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. ----- Alternatively, the entrepreneur may: (a) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 67, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (b) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio pursuant to Article 18 of the Law Decree 118/2021 which pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 can be filed only following the end of the negotiations; (c) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Bankruptcy Law or in the socalled “Prodi bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Law Decree 118/2021: (a) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021 maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with_ creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), bankruptcy (fallimento), compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio; (b) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 67, Paragraph 2, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (c) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 66 and Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register or if the court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021; (d) payments and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 10 of the Law Decree 118/2021, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions provided for pursuant to Article 216 and 217 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

If, in its Final Report, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome but have been conducted according to fairness and in good faith, and that the options provided under Article 11, Paragraphs 1 and 2, of the Law Decree 118/2021 are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file, with the competent court of the place where the company has its registered office, a petition for admission to the _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 161, Paragraph 2, letters a), b), c) and d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, which may divide the creditors into various classes.

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the expert. The expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided that they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. Unlike in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors or any public authority including tax authorities. The Italian Bankruptcy Law provides that, should these plans fail and the debtor be declared bankrupt, the payments and/ or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to claw-back action; and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-bankruptcy agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. _Debt Restructuring Agreements with Creditors pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (Accordi di Ristrutturazione dei Debiti)_ The debtor may negotiate with creditors holding at least 60% of the total amount of claims or debt restructuring agreements, subject to court’s sanctioning (omologazione). An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and that it ensures that the non-participating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms: (a) 120 days from the date of approval of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court; and (b) 120 days from the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the approval (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Only a debtor who is insolvent or in a situation of “financial distress” (i.e., facing financial crisis which does not yet amount to insolvency) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and is effective as of the day of its publication. The Italian Bankruptcy Law does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, among others, either for the prosecution of the business by the debtor or by a third party, or the sale of the business to a third party, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write-offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The 60-days moratorium can also be requested by the debtor, pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, while negotiations with creditors are pending (i.e., prior to the above-mentioned publication of the agreement), subject to certain conditions. Such moratorium request must be published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the date of publication. The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing within 30 days of the publication and orders the company to supply the relevant documentation in relation to the moratorium to the creditors. At such hearing, the court assesses whether the conditions for anticipating the moratorium are in place and, in such case, orders that no conservative or enforcement action may be started or continued, nor can security interests (unless agreed) be ----- acquired over the assets of the debtor, and sets a deadline (not exceeding 60 days) within which a debt restructuring agreement and the assessment by the expert must be deposited. The court’s order may be challenged within 15 days of its publication. Within the same time frame, an application for the concordato preventivo (as described below) may be filed, without prejudice to the effect of the moratorium. Creditors and other interested parties may oppose the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled the oppositions (if any) the court will validate the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 15 days of its publication. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015 modified the basis for calculation of the 60% of the outstanding debtor’s debt threshold required for courts’ sanctioning of debt restructuring agreements (accordi di _ristrutturazione dei debiti), easing the requirements with respect to financial creditors._ The new Article 182-bis, paragraph 8 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law No. 69 of May 21, 2021, and subsequently replaced by the Law Decree 118/2021, sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan, inter alia, if any substantial change to the plan are is necessary or required before or after the homologation of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors, the entrepreneur shall make the appropriate changes aimed at the implementation of such plan, requesting (i) the independent expert to renew its report as well as (ii) the creditors involved in such debt restructuring agreement to manifest their consent the necessary amendments. The Law Decree 118/2021 significantly amended Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and introduced in the Italian Bankruptcy Law the new Article-182-octies, Article 182-novies and Article-182 decies, thus anticipating some of the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to the new Article 182-novies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, the percentage of 60% provided under Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is reduced to the 30% if the debtor (a) waives the 120-day term for the satisfaction of its creditors provided for under Article 182-bis, paragraph 1, letters (a) and (b) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (therefore implying that the plan must be adequate and capable for the full and timely payment of dissenting creditors), (b) does not previously file a petition for admission to the concordato in bianco pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, and (c) does not request the 60-days moratorium pursuant to Article 182-bis, paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreements by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their legal status and economic interests), and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on non-adhering creditors of the same category (a so-called “cram_down”), provided that certain conditions are met, including that non-participating creditors shall be satisfied to a no lesser extent than the liquidation alternative. The law also provides that (i) the agreement shall be of a nonliquidating nature, (ii) the agreement shall contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern, and (iii) all the creditors belonging to the relevant category (and, therefore, affected by the proceeding) have been duly notified of the beginning of the negotiations, have been kept informed and have been notified the debt restructuring agreement and the sanctioning decree (decreto di omologa) and the related documentation. If these conditions are met, the remaining 25% of non-participating creditors belonging to the same class of creditors are crammed down; however, non-participating crammed down creditors can challenge the deal and refuse to be forced into it. Pursuant to Article 11 of the Law Decree 118/2021 the percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the reach of the debt restructuring agreement results from the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata della crisi. Pursuant to the new Article 182-septies, paragraph 5, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case, the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. ----- Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) entered into between a debtor and creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 67, paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the non-adhering creditors suffer a prejudice that is proportionate and consistent with the recovery strategies undertaken by the debtor, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. The debt restructuring agreement provided under Article 182-septies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the standstill agreement provided under Article 182-octies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law shall not impose new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities on non-participating creditors. Pursuant to the new Article 182-decies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Law Decree 118/2021, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with nonlimited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. Pursuant to Article 182-quater of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, financing granted to the debtor pursuant to the approved debt restructuring agreement (or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo)) enjoy priority status in cases of subsequent bankruptcy (such status also applies to financing granted by shareholders, but only up to 80% of such financing). Financing granted “in view of” (i.e., before) presentation of a petition for a debt restructuring agreement or a court-supervised pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (finanza ponte) or granted in execution of the composition with creditors (finanza in _esecuzione) may be granted such priority status provided that it is envisaged by the relevant plan or agreement_ and that such priority is expressly provided for by the court at the time of approval of the plan or sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement or the approval of the pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 182-quinquies of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the Court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a petition pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (in relation to the court supervised pre-bankruptcy agreement with creditors procedure described below) may authorize the debtor, if so expressly requested: (i) to incur in new super senior indebtedness and to secure such indebtedness with in rem security (garanzie reali), or by assigning claims, provided that the expert appointed by the debtor, having verified the overall financial needs of the company until the sanctioning (omologazione), declares that the new financing aims at providing a better satisfaction of the rights of the creditors, and (ii) to pay pre-existing debts deriving from the supply of services or goods, to the extent already payable and due, provided that the expert declares that such payment is essential for the keeping of the company’s activities and to ensure the best satisfaction for all creditors. In addition, according to the provisions of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, the aforementioned authorization may be given also before the filing of the additional documentation required pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The provision of Article 182-quinques of the Italian Bankruptcy Law applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised pre-bankruptcy compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Furthermore, according to the Article 182-quinquies, paragraph 3 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the court may also authorize the debtor to incur in new super senior (so called _prededucibile) indebtedness, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business. The_ company, while filing such request of authorization, is required to specify (i) the purpose of the financing; (ii) that ----- it is unable to otherwise obtain the required funds and (iii) that the absence of such financing will entail an imminent and irreparable prejudice to the company.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Only the debtor company can initially file a petition with the court for a _concordato preventivo_ (together with, among others, a restructuring plan and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, all enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors (whose debt became due before_ the sanctioning of the _concordato preventivo_ by the court) are stayed. During this time, all enforcement, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. Preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale) pursuant to Article 186-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities); (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal; (iii) the division of creditors into classes; and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. The filing of the petition for the concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary petition for a _concordato preventivo_ (so called _concordato in bianco, pursuant to Article 161, paragraph 6, of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, as amended by Italian Law Decree No. 69/2013 as converted into Italian Law No. 98/2013 (“Law Decree 69/2013”)). The debtor company may file such petition along with: (i) its financial statements from the latest three financial years; and (ii) the list of creditors with the reference to the amount of their respective receivables, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation within a period assigned by the court between 60 and 120 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi). In advance of such deadline, the debtor may also file a petition for the approval of a debt restructuring agreement (pursuant to Article 182 bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law). If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 173 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo; and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. The statutory provisions providing for the stay of enforcement and interim relief actions by the creditors referred to in respect of the concordato preventivo also apply to preliminary petitions for concordato preventivo (so called concordato in bianco). The debtor company may not file such pre-application where it had already done so in the previous two years without the admission to the _concordato preventivo_ having followed. The decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. ----- Noncompliance with these requirements results in the application for the composition with creditors being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into bankruptcy. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the application and the restructuring plan, the court may, ex officio, after hearing the debtor and—if appointed—the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the preliminary petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company and new super senior indebtedness authorized by the court, pending the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or after the filing of the moratorium application pursuant to Article 182-bis, Paragraph 6 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law also in absence of the plan pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, aimed at supporting urgent financial needs related to the company’s business as recently introduced by Article 1 of the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, are treated as super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and the related acts, payments and security interests granted are exempted from the claw-back action provided under Article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Italian Law No. 9/2014 specified that the superseniority of the claims—which arise out of loans granted with a view to allowing the filing of the preliminary petition for the composition with creditors (domanda di pre-concordato)—is granted, pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, conditional upon the proposal, the plan and all other required documents being filed within the term set by the court and the company being admitted to the concordato preventivo within the same proceeding opened with the filing of the preliminary petition. The composition proposal may propose that: (i) the debtor’s company’s business continues to be run by the debtor’s company as a going concern; or (ii) the business is transferred to one or more companies and any assets which are no longer necessary to run the business are liquidated (concordato con continuità aziendale). In these cases, the petition for the concordato preventivo should fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert will also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and calls a creditors’ meeting. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge. The debtor is allowed to carry out urgent extraordinary transactions only upon the prior court’s authorization, while ordinary transactions may be carried out without authorization. Third-party claims, related to the interim acts legally carried out by the debtor, are super-senior (so called prededucibili) pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The concordato preventivo is voted on at a creditors’ meeting and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, and (b) the majority of the classes. The composition with creditors is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Law 132/2015 abrogated the implied consent rule under which those creditors who, being entitled to vote, did not do so and those who did not express their dissent within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting are deemed as consenting to the composition with creditors. Under the current regime, creditors who did not exercise their voting rights in the creditors’ meeting can do so (even via email) within 20 days of the closure of the minutes of the creditors’ meeting and, after such term, creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the concordato proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies is untested in the Italian courts. Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value ----- being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The court may also approve the _concordato preventivo_ (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it; and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the dissenting creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions. If an objection to the implementation of the concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a dissenting class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case. The Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, introduced the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan to the debtor’s plan in a pre-bankruptcy agreement proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor do not ensure recovery of at least (i) 40% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio), or (ii) 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti chirografari) in case of pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). In addition, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, Law 132/2015 sets forth that a prebankruptcy agreement proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a pre-bankruptcy agreement proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that the unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage of at least 20% of their claims. This provision does not apply to pre-bankruptcy agreement proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). To the extent the alternative plan is approved by the creditors and sanctioned (omologato), the court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. In addition, Article 163-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, introduced by the Decree 83/2015, as amended by Law 132/2015, provides that, if a plan in pre-bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), pursuant to Article 161, Paragraph 2, letter (e) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third party, the judicial commissioner may request to the court the opening a competitive bidding process to the extent that it would be in the best interest of the creditors. After the approval by the creditors’ meeting, the court (having settled possible objections raised by the dissenting creditors, if any) confirms the concordato preventivo proposal by issuing a confirmation order. Pursuant to Article 169-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti), except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti _preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the_ application for the _concordato preventivo or to the judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time not exceeding 60 days, renewable just once. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the pre-bankruptcy composition. If the creditors’ meeting does not approve the concordato preventivo, the court may, upon request of the public prosecutor or a creditor, and having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, declare the company bankrupt. _Impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on Insolvency Proceedings_ In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian Government adopted new urgent measures, _inter alia, on insolvency matters (in addition to the Law Decree 118/2021 mentioned above) in order to (i) preserve the continuity of companies throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and after its end, with particular regard to those that were trading on a going concern basis before the COVID-19 pandemic, and (ii) ensure the successful outcome of ----- certain insolvency proceedings already pending during the COVID-19 pandemic or already approved by the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Among such legislative measures, the Italian Government enacted the Liquidity Decree. According to Article 9 of the Liquidity Decree the deadlines for the fulfilment of _concordati preventivi and the ratified debt restructuring agreements, among other things, the extension of 6 months of the deadlines for fulfillment of the obligations provided in an approved concordato preventivo or accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti omologati based on a plan expiring after February 23, 2020 shall be extended by six months. In the_ procedures for the approval (omologazione) of a concordato preventivo and of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di ristrutturazione dei debiti), pending on February 23, 2020, the debtor may submit, until the hearing, a petition for the grant of an extension up to 90 days for the deposit of a new plan and a new proposal for a concordato preventive in accordance with Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or a new debt restructuring agreement pursuant to Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. The period starts from the date of the decree by which the court assigns the term, and it shall not be extended. The request is inadmissible if submitted in the context of a concordato preventivo in the course of which it has already been held the meeting of creditors but the majorities were not reached according to Article 177 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law. Also, a set of measures is aimed at “relaxing” directors’ duties in connection with insolvency/pre-insolvency scenarios. The rules requiring the recapitalization (or liquidation or transformation into a different company type) of companies whose losses have substantially eroded the share capital will not apply with respect to losses arisen in the financial year ended on December 31, 2020 and until the five subsequent financial years. This measure, originally provided for by Article 6 of the Liquidity Decree, subsequently replaced by Article 1, paragraph 266, of Law No. 178 of December 30, 2020, is intended to address the risk that the impact of losses arising from the COVID-19 pandemic on the share capital of companies push directors into the unsustainable position of choosing between the following: (i) putting the company into liquidation or into a bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or (ii) facing potential personal liability as a result of the delay in complying with such obligations. _Bankruptcy Proceedings (Fallimento)_ A request to declare a debtor bankrupt and to commence bankruptcy proceedings (fallimento) for the judicial liquidation of its assets can be filed by the debtor, any of its creditors and, in certain cases, the public prosecutor when a debtor is insolvent. Insolvency, as defined under Italian Bankruptcy Law, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations with ordinary means as they come due. Bankruptcy is declared by the competent bankruptcy court. The Italian Bankruptcy Law is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; (ii) has_ had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years; and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess of €0.5 million. Upon the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors, actions are stayed and creditors must file claims within a defined period; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank _pari passu_ with all of the bankrupt’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in its decision; - the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the bankruptcy receiver (curatore fallimentare); - continuation of business may be authorized by the court if an interruption would cause greater damage to the company, but only if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors; ----- - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the bankruptcy declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the bankruptcy receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by Italian Bankruptcy Law. Bankruptcy proceedings are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, a deputy judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee. The bankruptcy receiver is not a representative of any one of the creditors, and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors as a whole. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority. The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate properties. In this respect, Law 132/2015 amended the relevant provision of the Italian Bankruptcy Law which sets forth the requirements applicable to the liquidation procedure and as a consequence the timing for the liquidation of a debtor is shortened. Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for priority of payment to certain preferential creditors, including employees, the Italian treasury, and judicial and social authorities. Such priority of payment is provided under mandatory provisions of law (as a consequence it is untested and it is unlikely that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements would be recognized by an Italian bankruptcy estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). Unsecured creditors are satisfied after payment of preferential and secure creditors, out of available funds and assets (if any) as below indicated. - **Bankruptcy composition with creditors (concordato fallimentare). Bankruptcy proceedings can terminate prior to liquidation through a bankruptcy composition proposal with creditors. The relevant petition can be filed by one or more creditors, third parties or the receiver starting from the declaration of bankruptcy, whereas the debtor or its subsidiaries are admitted to file such a proposal only after one year following such declaration but before the lapse of two years from the decree giving effectiveness to the bankruptcy’s estate (stato passivo). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of _concordato fallimentare, unless and to the extent they waive their security or the concordato fallimentare_ provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. The petition may provide for the division of creditors into classes (thereby proposing different treatments among the classes), and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims in any manner. The petition may provide that secured claims are paid only in part. The _concordato fallimentare_ proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in a majority of the classes). Final court confirmation is also required. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Bankruptcy Law may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. Article 111 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law establishes that proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of super senior claims (predeductibli) (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure); (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged, such as claims of secured creditors; and (iii) for the payment of unsecured creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the bankrupt’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles. The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire bankrupt’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. ----- - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, among others, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of bankruptcy. The key avoidance provisions address transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in bankruptcy compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In bankruptcy proceedings, the Italian Bankruptcy Law provides for a claw-back period of up to one year (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. Please note that in the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Bankruptcy Law distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the bankruptcy receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the bankrupt entity in the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 64 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law becomes part of the bankruptcy estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the declaration of bankruptcy, without need to wait the ineffectiveness of the transaction is sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge for violation of law; and (ii) Article 65 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law, payments of receivables falling due on the day of the insolvency declaration or thereafter are deemed ineffective _vis-à-vis_ creditors, if made by the bankrupt entity within the two-year period prior to the insolvency declaration. - **Acts that could be declared ineffective at the request of the bankruptcy receiver. (a) The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below (so called “suspect period”), may be clawed back (revocati) vis-à-vis the bankruptcy as provided for by article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and be declared ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (i) onerous transactions entered into in the year before the insolvency declaration, when the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the bankrupt entity exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; (ii) payments of debts, due and payable, which were not made by the debtor in cash or by other customary means of payment in the year prior to the insolvency declaration; (iii) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the year prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (iv) pledges and mortgages granted by the bankrupt entity in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time when the new security was granted. (b) The following acts and transactions, if made during the suspect period or such other period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective if the bankruptcy receiver proves that the non-insolvent party knew that the bankrupt entity was insolvent at the time of the act or transaction: (i) payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions entered into or made within six months prior to the insolvency declaration; and (ii) granting of security interest for debts incurred in the six months prior to the insolvency declaration. ----- (c) The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (i) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (ii) a remittance on a bank account; provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the bankrupt entity’s debt towards the bank; (iii) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, currently in force, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (iv) transactions entered into, payments made and guarantees granted by the debtor pursuant to an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) under Article 67, paragraph 3(d) of the Italian Bankruptcy Law; (v) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee granted in the context of “concordato _preventivo” under Article 161 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law or an “accordo di ristrutturazione del debito” under Article 182-bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law;_ (vi) remuneration payments to the bankrupt entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (vii) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to concordato preventivo procedures. In addition, in certain cases, the bankruptcy receiver can request that certain transactions of the bankrupt entity be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. Under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the bankrupt entity disposed of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the bankrupt entity was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the bankruptcy entity for the purpose of prejudicing the bankrupt entity) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo _patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_ the creditor against the third party purchaser.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

It is an out-of-court proceeding, but the court can be involved in the two following circumstances: (i) when the entrepreneur files a petition pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code requesting the competent court to confirm or modify the protective measures provided for pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code (the “Protective Measures”) on the same day as the publication of the request in the relevant Companies’ Register (Registro delle Imprese) and the acceptance of the Expert (as defined below), and, if necessary, to enact the interim measures necessary to complete the negotiations (the “Interim Measures”), and (ii) when the entrepreneur files a petition asking the court to authorize certain acts in line with the provisions set forth under Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The _composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is a proceeding aimed at facilitating the recovery of companies which “despite being in conditions of asset or economic and financial imbalance such as to make it likely that financial distress or insolvency will occur, have the potential to remain in the market, including through the sale of the business or a branch of it.” According to Article 12 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa can be pursued by enterprises, either commercial (imprenditore commerciale) and agricultural_ (imprenditore agricolo), which are undergoing a distressed situation with reference to their assets, their business and/or their financial situation, such that it is likely that a distress/crisis or insolvency will follow. It is, therefore, a procedure aiming at anticipating further deterioration of the debtor’s situation. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, inter alia, the entrepreneur or the enterprise filing for a composizione _negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa (i) shall certify that no judicial liquidation proceedings or similar_ proceedings are pending towards itself nor requests for the admission to the procedures provided for under Articles 40 of the Italian Insolvency Code, including pursuant to Articles 44, paragraph 1, letter a) and 54, paragraph 3, have been previously filed, and (ii) in the event that the application for a composizione negoziata per la soluzione ----- _della crisi d’impresa is dismissed, other than the case where such dismissal is requested by the entrepreneur, may_ not submit a new request before one year has elapsed after dismissal. Pursuant to Article 25 of the Italian Insolvency Code, _the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa may also apply to group of companies, which may commence one proceeding all together. It should be_ noted that paragraph 9 of such provision provides for the group companies—at the end of the negotiations—to either enter into one of the agreements referred to in Article 23, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code as a group, or use one of the tools referred to under Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, both separately or as a whole group. The composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa is commenced on a voluntary basis only, filing of a petition for the appointment of a third-party and independent expert to the Secretary General of the relevant Chamber of Commerce by way of a dedicated electronic platform (the “Expert”). Pending a procedure for over-indebtedness restructuring agreement or liquidation of assets referred to in Articles 7 and 14_ter of Law No. 3 of 27 January 2012 (i.e., procedimenti di composizione della crisi da sovraindebitamento e di _liquidazione del patrimonio), the petition cannot be filed. Pursuant to Article 16 of the Italian Insolvency Code_ the person who acted as Expert in the context of such proceeding, shall not have or maintain professional relations with the entrepreneur during the two years following the termination of the negotiated proceeding. The Expert is appointed within five days upon the filing of the request. The Expert is responsible for facilitating and managing the negotiations between the company, its creditors and any other interested parties, in order to identify a solution to overcome the crisis or the insolvency, including through the transfer of the business or a branch thereof. The Expert assesses his/her own independence, the adequacy of his/her own professional expertise and his/her own time availability with respect to the prospected assignment, and, if the outcome of the assessment is positive, notifies his/her acceptance to the entrepreneur and uploads it on a dedicated electronic platform (the “Platform”). In case of negative outcome, the Expert confidentially notifies it to the commission, which appoints a new Expert. If the Expert accepts the appointment, he/she meets with the entrepreneur in order to assess whether there are concrete and real chances of recovery. The entrepreneur attends the meeting personally and can be assisted by its advisors. If the Expert finds that there are concrete and real chances of recovery (risanamento), he/she meets with the parties involved in the entrepreneur’s recovery process and presents the possible strategies, scheduling periodic meetings close in time to one another. During the negotiations, all the parties involved must act in good faith and with fairness, must cooperate and are bound by confidentiality on the entrepreneur’s situation, on the actions carried out or planned by the entrepreneur and on the information received in the course of the negotiations. The entrepreneur must provide a complete and clear representation of his/her situation and manage his/her assets without causing unfair prejudice to the creditors. Banks and financial intermediaries, their agents, and, in case of credit assignment and/or transfer, their assignees or transferees, must take part in the negotiations actively and in an informed manner, and the access to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa does not, by itself, constitute ground for withdrawal of overdraft facilities. Specific provisions apply to negotiations involving employment contracts. If the Expert finds that there are no real chances of recovery (risanamento), after the meeting with the entrepreneur or thereafter, he/she has to promptly notify the entrepreneur and the secretary general of the chamber of commerce, which provides for the dismissal of the entrepreneur’s petition. The Expert’s appointment is considered terminated if, after 180 days from its appointment, the parties have not agreed on a solution (that can also be proposed by the Expert) for overcoming the entrepreneur’s distressed situation. However, the Expert’s appointment can continue up to further 180 days (pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 7 of the Italian Insolvency Code) if (i) all the parties involved in the negotiations require so and the Expert agrees, or (ii) the prosecution of the appointment is required by the fact that the entrepreneur has filed a petition to the court pursuant to Article 19 and/or Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 17, paragraph 8 of the Italian Insolvency Code, at the end of his/her appointment the Expert issues a final report (the “Final Report”), uploads it on the Platform, and notifies it to the entrepreneur and to the court that has granted the Protective Measures and Interim Measures (if any) which declares the termination of their related effects. Pursuant to Article 18 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with the petition for appointment of the Expert, or with a subsequent petition, the entrepreneur can request the application of Protective Measures, which may also be limited, upon entrepreneur request, to certain creditors’ claims or to a specific category of creditors. The Protective Measures consist of the following: from the date of publication of the relevant petition, preexisting ----- creditors cannot obtain preemption rights (diritti di prelazione) unless agreed upon by the entrepreneur and all enforcement and interim actions are stayed. However, as opposed to what happens in the concordato preventivo, payment of preexisting creditors is not forbidden. The Protective Measures do not apply to employees’ claims. From the date of publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures until the date of conclusion of the negotiations or dismissal of the petition for the composizione negoziata, the ruling of opening the judicial liquidation proceeding (sentenza di apertura della liquidazione giudiziale) or the declaration of the insolvency of the entrepreneur cannot be declared insolvent by the court, provided that the court revokes the Protective Measures. The creditors whose rights are affected by the Protective Measures cannot unilaterally refuse to perform their obligations under the contracts in place with the entrepreneur, nor terminate such contracts, nor anticipate their expiration date, nor amend them with detrimental consequences for the entrepreneur, solely on the ground of the missed payment of claims arisen prior to the publication of the petition requesting the application of the Protective Measures. However, the creditors may suspend the fulfilment of the pending contracts from the publication of the petition requesting Protective Measures to the obtainment of such Protective Measures. If the entrepreneur applies for the Protective Measures (which, as said, are immediately effective), it must simultaneously file the same request to the competent court, in order to allow a judge to check the said measures and to confirm them or, if necessary, to modify them. In the absence of this request, the Protective Measures will be ineffective. The duration of the Protective Measures and, if necessary, the Interim Measures, is established by an order of the court in a range between 30 and 120 days, and, upon request of the parties and after obtaining the opinion of the Expert, can be extended for the time required to positively finalize the negotiations up to a maximum of 240 days, given that the judge may discretionary order the revocation of such Protective Measures or shorten their duration. During the procedure the entrepreneur remains able to continue the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company, subject to certain conditions. More precisely, pursuant to Article 21 of the Italian Insolvency Code, pending the negotiations, the entrepreneur may carry out acts pertaining to ordinary activity, and, upon written notice to the Expert, carry out acts pertaining to extraordinary activity or make payments non-consistent with the negotiations nor with the perspectives of recovery, in such a way as to avoid prejudicing the economic and financial sustainability of the business. Furthermore, if during the course of the negotiations, it appears that the entrepreneur is insolvent but there are real prospects of recovery, the entrepreneur shall manage the enterprise in the best interests of the creditors, subject to his liabilities. If the Expert believes that a certain act causes prejudice to the creditors, to the negotiations or to the perspectives of recovery, he/she reports it in writing to the entrepreneur and to the enterprise’s control body. If, notwithstanding the Expert’s report, the entrepreneur carries out the relevant act, the entrepreneur gives immediate notice to the Expert, who may file his/her dissent for the registration with the companies’ register. At the request of the entrepreneur, one or more creditors or the Expert, the Court that has granted the Protective Measures and/or Interim Measures may, at any time, revoke such measures or reduce their duration when they do not meet the aim of ensuring the positive outcome of the negotiations or they appear disproportionate in relation to the prejudice caused to the creditors, pursuant to Article 19, paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code. If the Protective Measures are revoked, the prohibition of the obtainment of preemption rights by preexisting creditors ceases to be effective for the date on which the Protective Measure has been revoked. Pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the court, upon the entrepreneur’s request and to the extent that this is consistent with the continuation of the business as a going concern and with the maximization of the creditors’ recovery, may authorize: (a) the entrepreneur or one or more companies belonging to the same group to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called prededucibile) pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (b) the entrepreneur to incur new super-senior indebtedness (so-called _prededucibile) via shareholders’ financing pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (c) the entrepreneur to transfer its business, or certain business branches, without the effects provided under Article 2560, paragraph 2, of the Italian Civil Code, without prejudice to Article 2112 of the Italian Civil Code. However, in such case it will be for the court itself to identify the measures it considers appropriate, ----- taking also into account the requests of the parties concerned, in order to protect all the interests involved. The court shall also verify the compliance with the competitiveness principle in choosing the purchaser. Pursuant to Article 23 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi _d’impresa can terminate as follows:_ (a) execution of an agreement between the entrepreneur and one or more creditors, which constitutes cause for application of the reward measures provided under Article 25-bis, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code if, according to the Expert’s Final Report, such agreement ensures the continuation of the business as a going concern for at least 2 years; (b) execution of a standstill agreement (convenzione di moratoria) pursuant to Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) execution of an agreement signed by the entrepreneur, by the creditors and by the Expert, with the effects provided under Articles 166, paragraph 3, lett. d) and 324. With such agreement the Expert acknowledges that the reorganization plan (piano di risanamento) seems to be consistent with the composition of the insolvency and crisis of the entrepreneur. At the end of the negotiations, if none of the above-mentioned agreement is executed, the entrepreneur may alternatively: (a) file a petition requesting the sanctioning of a debt restructuring agreement with creditors _(accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti) pursuant to Articles 57, 60 and 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The_ percentage referred to under Article 61, paragraph 2, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code is reduced to 60% if the achievement of the agreement results from the final report of the Expert; (b) arrange an out-of-court reorganization plan (piano attestato di risanamento) pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code; (c) file a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code; (d) enter into one of the insolvency proceedings provided under the Italian Insolvency Code or in the socalled “Prodi-bis” procedure or the “Marzano” procedure; Furthermore, pursuant to Article 24 of the Italian Insolvency Code: (a) the acts authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code shall maintain their effects in the event of subsequent sanctioned debt restructuring agreement with creditors (accordo di _ristrutturazione dei debiti omologato), sanctioned court-supervised pre-judicial liquidation composition_ with creditors (concordato preventivo omologato), opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding (apertura della liquidazione giudiziale), a sanctioned restructuring plan provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code, a compulsory administrative winding-up (liquidazione coatta _amministrativa), extraordinary administration for large insolvent companies (amministrazione straordinaria) or simplified pre-judicial liquidation composition with creditors agreement aimed at the_ liquidation of the debtor’s assets (concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio) provided for pursuant to Article 25-sexies of the Italian Insolvency Code; (b) the payments of debts that are immediately due and payable, any onerous transactions and the granting of security interests made after the Expert accepted its appointment, are exempted from claw-back actions pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code if they are consistent with the development and the status of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) in place at the time the payment/transaction/granting of security interest was made; (c) acts pertaining to the entrepreneur’s extraordinary activity and payment made after the Expert accepted its appointment are subject to claw-back actions pursuant to Article 165 and Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code if the Expert has registered his/her dissent in the companies’ register pursuant to Article 21, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code or if the competent court has denied its authorization pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and ----- (d) payment and transactions made after the Expert accepted its appointment, which the Expert assesses to be consistent with the development of the negotiations and with the perspectives of recovery (risanamento) of the enterprise, or which have been authorized by the court pursuant to Article 22 of the Italian Insolvency Code, benefit of exemptions from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

If, in its Final Report, in the context of a composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa proceeding, the Expert states that the negotiations did not have a positive outcome (i.e. the entrepreneur has not been able to reach an agreement with its creditors) but have been conducted according to fairness and good faith and that the options provided under Article 23, paragraphs 1 and 2, letter b), of the Italian Insolvency Code are not feasible, within 60 days following the notification of the Final Report the entrepreneur may file to the competent court where the entrepreneur has its center of main interests a petition for admission to the concordato semplificato per _la liquidazione del patrimonio, together with a liquidation plan and the documents listed under Article 39 of the_ Italian Insolvency Code. The petition for _concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del patrimonio is then published in the companies’ register within the day following the filing with the court. From the date of such publication, the effects provided under Articles 6, 46, 94 and 96 of the Italian Insolvency Code are produced. Following the filing of such application, the court (i) appoints a so-called “auxiliary” (ausiliario) to, inter alia, express an opinion on the entrepreneur’s proposal, (ii) orders that the proposal, together with the opinion of the auxiliary and the final report of the expert, be delivered by the debtor to the creditors appearing on the list filed by the debtor itself, and (iii) sets the date of the hearing for the court sanctioning (omologazione). Creditors and any third-party which has any interests are entitled to object to the court sanctioning (omologazione) within ten days before the date fixed for the hearing. If the court, having verified the legitimacy of the objection and the procedure, as well as compliance with priority creditor claims and the feasibility of the liquidation plan, finds that the proposal does not prejudice the creditors with respect to the alternative of a judicial liquidation and that, in any event, it ensures a benefit to each creditor, it approves the composition with creditors proposal by decree, by which it shall also appoint a liquidator. The court issues a decree of sanctioning (omologazione) of the concordato semplificato per la liquidazione del _patrimonio when it finds that (i) the proceeding has been carried out in accordance with relevant laws and_ regulations and the adversarial principle among the parties (contraddittorio), (ii) the proposal is compliant with preemption rights (cause di prelazione) and the liquidation plan is feasible, and (iii) the proposal does not cause a prejudice to the creditors compared to what they would receive in case of insolvent liquidation of the entrepreneur, and in any case ensures that each creditor receives a certain recovery. With the approval decree, the court also appoints a liquidator. The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. Pursuant to Article 25-septies of the Italian Civil Code, the liquidation plan may also include an offer by a preidentified third-party to transfer the business or one or more branches of the business or specific assets to such third-party, even before the approval: in this case, the judicial liquidator, having verified the absence of better solutions on the market, may implement the offer.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

An independent expert appointed directly by the debtor and enrolled in the Register of Auditors and Accounting Experts (Registro dei Revisori Legali) must verify the feasibility of the restructuring plan and the truthfulness of the business data provided by the company. There is no need to obtain court approval to appoint the independent expert. The independent expert must possess certain specific professional requisites and qualifications and meet ----- the requirements set forth by Article 2399 of the Italian Civil Code and may be subject to liability in case of misrepresentation or false certification. Out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant debt restructuring arrangements are not under any form of judicial control or approval and, therefore, no application is required to be filed with the court or supervising authority. Also, Out-of-court debt restructuring arrangements are not required to be approved and consented to by a specific majority of all outstanding claims. The terms and conditions of these plans are freely negotiable, provided they are finalized at restructuring the debtor’s indebtedness and rebalancing its capital structure. However, the possibility to adopt such tools to liquidate the debtor is disputed, as it is argued they shall provide for the restructuring of the debtor’s indebtedness and the rebalancing its financial condition on a going concern basis. Unlike in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement proceedings and debt restructuring agreements, out-of-court reorganization plans do not offer the debtor any protection against enforcement proceedings and/or precautionary actions of third-party creditors. The Italian Insolvency Code provides that, should these plans fail, and the debtor be declared insolvent, the payments and/or acts carried out, and/or security interest granted on the debtor’s assets for the implementation of the reorganization plan, subject to certain conditions (a) are not subject to any claw-back action (azione revocatoria), including the claw-back action provided for pursuant to Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, as provided for pursuant to Article 166, paragraph 3, letter d) of the Italian Insolvency Code, and (b) are exempted from the potential application of certain criminal sanctions. Neither ratification by the court nor publication in the Companies’ Register are needed (although publication in the Companies’ Register of the plan, the report by the independent expert and the arrangements is possible upon a debtor’s request and would allow to certain tax benefits), and, therefore, the risk of bad publicity or disvalue judgments are lower than in case of an in-court pre-judicial liquidation agreement or a debt restructuring agreement. Since the reorganization plan (or the agreements entered into to implement it) is not subject to any court approval or judicial review, it cannot be excluded that the abovementioned exemption effects will be challenged in the event of subsequent judicial liquidation, if the competent court were to assess that the reorganization plan was not feasible at the time it was certified by the independent expert. Unlike Italian Bankruptcy Law, Italian Insolvency Law sets forth specific rules regarding out-of-court reorganization plans and the relevant restructuring arrangements entered into with creditors, which must be followed for the plans and agreements to grant protection against claw-back actions and potential civil and criminal responsibilities. More in detail, out-of-court debt restructuring plans pursuant to Article 56 of the Italian Insolvency Code must be supported by adequate documentation representing the financial and commercial situation of the debtor and which also needs to indicate, among others, the causes of the crisis and the new resources which will be made available to the debtor and the industrial plan. Moreover, they must be suitable for the purpose of assuring the restructuring of the indebtedness of the debtor and rebalancing its financial position and, in case of its failure and subsequent challenge (impugnazione) before an Italian court, it must not be deemed as being unreasonable.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

An independent expert appointed by the debtor must assess the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company and declare and that the agreement is feasible and, particularly, that it ensures that the indebtedness vis-à-vis nonparticipating creditors can be fully satisfied within the following terms in a 120-day term from: (i) the date of sanctioning (omologazione) of the agreement by the court, in the case of debts which are due and payable to the non-participating creditors as of the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court, and (ii) the date on which the relevant debts fall due, in case of debts which are not yet due and payable to the non-participating creditors as at the date of the sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement by the court. Pursuant to Article 57 of the Italian Insolvency Code, only a debtor who is insolvent or facing a state of crisis (as described above) can initiate this process and request the court’s sanctioning (omologazione) of the debt restructuring agreement entered into with its creditors. The agreement is published in the companies’ register and becomes effective as of the day of its publication. Creditors and other interested parties may challenge the agreement within 30 days from the publication of the agreement in the companies’ register. After having settled with the opposition (if any), the court will sanction ----- (omologare) the agreement by issuing a decree, which can be appealed within 30 days of its publication pursuant to Article 51 of the Italian Insolvency Code. The Italian Insolvency Code does not expressly provide for any indications concerning the contents of the debt restructuring agreement. The plan can therefore provide, inter alia, either for the debtor or a third-party carrying out the business, or the sale of the business, and may contain refinancing agreements, moratoria, write offs and/or postponements of claims. The debt restructuring agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Article 58, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code sets the rule for when substantial amendments are made to the plan. More precisely, in the event of substantial amendments to the plan before the approval, the report issued by the expert and the consent to the debt restructuring agreement expressed by creditors shall be renewed. The report shall also be renewed in the event of substantial amendment. In the event of substantial amendments after the approval, the debtor shall make such amendments as are appropriate to ensure the implementation of the agreements, by requesting the update of the certified report issued by the expert having the requirements set forth in Article 57, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code. In this case, the renewed certified report, together with the amended restructuring plan, shall be published in the companies’ register, giving appropriate notice to the creditors by registered letter or by certified email (PEC). The parties may file an objection (opposizione) to the abovementioned decree within 30 days after having been notified of the same. _The key features of a debt restructuring agreement_ With the petition for the approval by the court of the debt restructuring agreement (or at any time pending the procedure) the debtor may request to be granted any protective measures (e.g., a stay of actions or the creation by creditors of security interest (unless it is agreed in the debt restructuring agreement) in relation to pre-existing debts, etc.) (the “Measures”). Such Measures can also be requested (i) pursuant to Article 54, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, to the court by the debtor pending negotiations with creditors (i.e., prior to the filing of the petition for approval of the agreement), subject to certain conditions, or (ii) pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for approval of the debt restructuring agreement includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). No dispossession of debtor occurs in respect of a debt restructuring agreement, but the court may appoint a judicial commissioner to oversee the proceedings and must do so in case petitions for the opening of judicial liquidation are pending, when it is necessary for the protection of the parties who filed such petitions. It is a court-supervised procedure, which can take from a few months up to more than a year (the duration of the proceedings is generally influenced by challenges). Creditors entering into the debt restructuring agreement are not required to receive the same treatment (i.e., they are free to reject the proposal and to protect their interests otherwise) and no cram-down is applicable to third-party non-adhering creditors, who shall be fully re-paid within 120 days from sanctioning (omologa) of the debt restructuring agreement (if the claims are already due and payable at such date) or within 120 days from the respective maturity date if such creditors’ claims are not yet due as of the validation date of such debt restructuring agreement as per respectively Article 57, paragraph 3 letters a) and b). The court, having verified the completeness of the documentation filed by the debtor, sets the date for a hearing to be held no earlier of 15 days from the notification of the relevant filing. Pending such deadline, creditors and other interested parties may file an opposition to the approval. At such hearing, the court decides upon any opposition and assesses whether the conditions for the approval are met. Pursuant to the Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code, debtors are entitled to enter into debt restructuring agreement by obtaining the approval of creditors representing at least 75% of the credits belonging to the same category (with respect to the homogeneity of their status and economic interests) and can request the court to declare that agreement binding on the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category (so called “cram down”). More in detail, debt restructuring agreements with extended effects (accordi di ristrutturazione ad efficacia estesa) provided pursuant to Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code - which were previously only permitted in relation to debts owed to banks and financial intermediaries where such debts represented at least 50% of the total indebtedness - can now be applied to any category of creditors, provided that, _inter alia: (i) all the creditors belonging to the same category have been informed of the start of the negotiations and have been able to participate in them in good faith and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation as well as on the restructuring agreement and its effects, (ii) the agreement provides for the ----- continuation of the business activity either directly or indirectly pursuant to Article 84 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (iii) the claims of the consenting creditors belonging to a same category represent at least 75% of all the claims belonging to the same category, (iv) the non-adhering creditors belonging to the same category to which the effects of the agreement are extended can be satisfied under the agreement for an amount not lower than the amount they would receive with the judicial liquidation being understood that a creditor may hold claims in more than one category, and (v) the debtor has notified the agreement, the application for court approval and the documents attached thereto to the creditors to be crammed down. The percentage of 75% is lowered to 60% if the debt restructuring agreement is referred to in the Final Report issued by the Expert at the end of the negotiations pertaining to the composizione negoziata per la soluzione della crisi d’impresa. Moreover, pursuant to the new Article 61, paragraph 5, of the Italian Insolvency Code, a special provision is set forth for debtors whose financial indebtedness is at least 50% of their total indebtedness: in this situation the debt restructuring agreement may identify one or more categories of creditors which are banks and financial intermediaries which have a homogeneous legal position and economic interests and extend the effects of the agreement to non-participating creditors who are part of the same category. In such instance, the agreement is valid even if it does not contemplate the direct or indirect continuation of the business activity as a going concern. However, in such case the rights of creditors who are not banks or financial intermediaries remain valid. Similarly, pursuant to the new Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a standstill agreement (convenzione di _moratoria) entered into between a debtor and its creditors representing 75% of the same class would also bind the_ non-participating creditors, provided that (A) an independent expert meeting the requirements provided under Article 62, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code has been appointed and certifies (i) the truthfulness of the business data, (ii) the attitude of the standstill agreement to temporarily regulate the effects of the crisis and (iii) the fact that the treatment reserved to non-adhering creditors is at least equal to the one they could obtain in the context of a judicial winding up, and (B) certain further conditions are met (e.g., all the creditors belonging to the relevant category have been duly noticed of the beginning of the negotiations, have been made able to participate in the negotiations and have received complete and up-to-date information on the debtor’s assets, economic and financial situation and on the agreement and its related effects). Non-adhering crammed-down creditors can challenge the standstill agreement within 30 days after having been notified of the same. In no case debt restructuring agreements provided for under Article 61 of the Italian Insolvency Code and standstill agreements provided under Article 62 of the Italian Insolvency Code may impose on the non-adhering creditors, _inter alia, performance of new obligations, the granting of new overdraft facilities, the maintenance of the_ possibility to utilize the existing facilities or the utilization of new facilities. Furthermore, Article 60 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the so-called facilitated debt restructuring agreement (“accordi di ristrutturazione agevolati”). Such proceeding, is a particular kind of debt restructuring agreement which may be entered into with creditors representing as little as 30% of the total indebtedness (instead of the 60% generally required under Article 57, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code) provided that the debtor: (i) has waived the standstill on the payment of non-consenting creditors (usually provided for by law, for a period of 120 days from the court approval of the agreement or from the maturity date of the relevant obligations, in “ordinary” restructuring agreements), and (ii) has not previously requested to the court the granting of protective interim measures on the its assets. By virtue of Article 59 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 1239 of the Italian Civil Code applies to the creditors that have adhered to the debt restructuring agreements. Non-participating creditors maintain their claims towards (i) those who are jointly and severally liable with the debtor, (ii) the debtor’s guarantors and (iii) debtors by way of right of recourse (regresso). Unless agreed otherwise, debt restructuring agreements produce effect towards the shareholders who are jointly liable with non-limited liability companies, provided that, if such shareholders have granted guarantees, they will remain liable as guarantors. The provision of Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code applies to both debt restructuring agreement and to the court-supervised compositions with creditors (concordato preventivo) outlined below. Pursuant to Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis: (a) the debtor may repay, in accordance with the relevant contractual terms, the installments due under a loan agreement which is secured by way of a security interest over the assets used in the business, provided that: (a) at the date of the filing of the application for admission to the composition with creditors, the debtor has fulfilled its obligations or the court authorizes the payment of the debt for ----- principal and interest due at that date, and (b) the expert meeting the requirements set forth in Article 52, paragraph 3, of the Italian Insolvency Code certifies (i) that such payments are essential for the continuation of the business activity and functional to ensuring the best satisfaction of the creditors (as already required by Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code), and (ii) that the secured claims can be fully satisfied with the proceeds of the liquidation of the asset carried out at market value and that the repayment of the installments due does not prejudice the rights of the other creditors; (b) the court may authorize payment of the remuneration due, for the months preceding the filing of the application for the composition with creditors, to the workers employed in the business whose continuation is envisaged under the plan. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 73 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in case of revocation of the sanctioning (omologa), the court, upon the debtor’s petition, shall order the conversion to a judicial liquidation procedure. If the revocation results from acts of fraud (atti in frode ai creditori) or non-performance of the obligations arising under the debt restructuring agreement, the petition for conversion may also be proposed by creditors or by the public prosecutor. In case of conversion, the court shall grant additional time to the debtor aimed at supplementing the documentation and shall act in accordance with Article 270 of the Italian Insolvency Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651
407_1,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,256,LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL AND CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS,256.5,Italian Insolvency Code,256.5.6,Court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo),"A company which is insolvent or in a situation of crisis (as defined above) and that has not been declared insolvent by the court has the option to make a composition proposal to its creditors, under court supervision, in order to compose its overall indebtedness and/or reorganize its business, thereby avoiding a declaration of insolvency and the initiation of insolvency proceedings (so called “concordato preventivo”). Such composition proposal can be made by a commercial enterprise which exceeds any of the following thresholds: (i) has had assets (attivo _patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) gross_ revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness in excess (included debts not yet due) of €0.5 million. Only the debtor can file a petition with the court for a concordato preventivo with the court based in the location of the debtor’s main office. The debtor must file the petition together with, among others, a restructuring plan containing an analytic description of manner and timing of the fulfillment of the proposal and an independent expert report assessing the feasibility of the composition proposal and the truthfulness of the business and accounting data provided by the company). The petition for concordato preventivo is then published by the debtor in the company’s register by the registry of the court and communicated to the public prosecutor. From the date of such publication to the date on which the court sanctions the _concordato preventivo, preexisting creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato preventivo is published in the company’s register are ineffective against such pre- existing creditors. According to Article 54, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code, provided that the petition for the admission to the _concordato proceedings includes the relevant request for Measures, from the date of publication of the petition in the companies’ registry, it is prohibited to commence or continue the enforcement and the conservative actions (or, in any event, to take any initiatives prohibited under the relevant Measures). As already described with reference to debt restructuring agreements, at any time pending the proceedings, the debtor may request to be granted Measures, which can also be requested pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code, together with a pre-petition for the access to one of the restructuring tools provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. The composition proposal filed in connection with the petition may provide for: (i) the restructuring and payment of debts and the satisfaction of creditors’ claims (provided that, in any case, it will ensure payment of at least 20% of the unsecured receivables, except for the case of composition with creditors with continuity of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale), including through extraordinary transactions, such as the granting to creditors and to their subsidiaries or affiliated companies of shares, bonds (including bonds convertible into shares), or other financial instruments and debt securities), (ii) the transfer to a receiver (assuntore) of the operations of the debtor company making the composition proposal, (iii) the division of creditors into classes (which is mandatory in certain cases provided under the Article 85 of the Italian Insolvency Code), provided that each class is composed of creditors having homogeneous legal positions and economic interests, and (iv) different treatment of creditors belonging to different classes. The composition proposal may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Save for the provisions provided for under Article 109 of the Italian Insolvency Code, Article 86 of the Italian Insolvency Code has provided that, in the context of a composition with creditors on a going concern basis (concordato con continuità), the plan may provide for a standstill for the secured creditors, which may extend up to six months from the date of sanctioning (omologa) of ----- the composition with creditors proposal for the payment of secured creditors (creditori privilegiati) pursuant to Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code (i.e. employees, professionals etc.). Pursuant to Article 84, paragraph 4, the Italian Insolvency Code, in order to strengthen the position of the unsecured creditors, a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) (i.e., a composition with creditors proposal aiming at transferring all the assets to the creditors and having such assets sold in their interest by the judicial commissioner) must ensure that (i) with the relevant filing for such proceeding, external resources are contributed which increase the assets available at the time of such filing by at least 10%, and (ii) the degraded secured creditors as well as unsecured creditors are paid in a percentage equal to 20% of their total claims. In this respect, it should be noted that resources contributed for the purpose of a composition with creditors proposal with liquidation purpose (concordato liquidatorio) may be distributed notwithstanding the provisions set forth under Articles 2740 and 2741 of the Italian Civil Code provided that such distribution complies with the 20% requirement set forth above. Resources contributed are considered as “external” when provided for any reason by the debtor’s shareholders without obligation of repayment or subordination, in relation to which the plan provides them to be for the sole benefit of the creditors. This provision does not apply to composition with creditors proposals based on the continuation of the going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale). Under the composition with creditors, there is no dispossession of the debtor who accordingly retains management powers under the supervision of a court-appointed official (commissario giudiziale) and the deputy judge. From the date of the publication of the petition to the date on which the court sanctions the concordato preventivo, the debtor is entitled to operate in the ordinary course of its business, although extraordinary transactions require the prior written approval of the court. Provided that the abovementioned steps are taken, during this time, all enforcement actions, precautionary actions and interim measures sought by the creditors, whose title arose beforehand, are stayed. The accrual of interests is suspended for the same timeframe, except for claims secured by pledges, liens or mortgages. Pre-existing creditors cannot obtain security interests (unless authorized by the court) and mortgages registered within the 90 days preceding the date on which the petition for the _concordato _preventivo is published in the companies’ register are ineffective against such pre-existing creditors. Any act,_ payment or security executed or created after the filing of the concordato preventivo application and in accordance with its rules and procedures is exempt from claw-back action. The debtor is also exempt from certain bankruptcy crimes provided under Articles 322, third paragraph (“preferential bankruptcy”), and 323 (“simple bankruptcy”) of the Italian Insolvency Code, in relation to acts and payments made in execution of the composition with creditors and/or in relation to finance provided under Article 99 of the Italian Insolvency Code upon judicial authorization. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company have super senior priority (prededucibilità) in the event of a subsequent judicial winding-up (see Statutory priorities below). For details regarding super senior financing, please refer to the following paragraph _Available financing forms _under the Italian Insolvency Code._ The filing of the petition for the _concordato preventivo may be preceded by the filing of a preliminary and simplified petition pursuant to Article 44 of the Italian Insolvency Code. For sake of clarity, under Italian Insolvency Code, the simplified petition may be utilized by the debtor also to access a debt restructuring agreement or a restructuring plan subject to sanctioning by the court (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) or a concordato. The debtor company may file such petition, reserving the right to submit the underlying plan, the proposal and all relevant documentation (or the debt restructuring agreement, or the restructuring plan) within a period assigned by the court (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are not pending. If the court accepts such preliminary petition, it may, among other things: (i) appoint a judicial commissioner (commissario giudiziale) to overview the company, who, in the event that the debtor has carried out one of the activities under Article 106 of the Italian Insolvency Code (e.g., concealment of part of assets, omission to report one or more claims, declaration of nonexistent liabilities or commission of other fraudulent acts), will report it to the court, which, upon further verification, may reject the petition at court for a _concordato preventivo, and (ii) set forth reporting and information duties of the company during the abovementioned period. As mentioned above, filing the simplified petition, the debtor may request the application of Measures. Pursuant to Article 44, paragraph 1, letter c) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the decree setting the term for the presentation of the documentation contains also the periodical information requirements (also relating to the financial management of the company and to the activities carried out for the purposes of the filing of the application and the restructuring plan) that the company has to fulfill, at least on a monthly basis, until the lapse of the term established by the court. The debtor company will file, on a monthly basis, the company’s financial position, which is published, the following day, in the company’s register. ----- Noncompliance with these requirements results in the simplified petition being declared inadmissible and, upon request of the creditors or the public prosecutor and provided that the relevant requirements are verified, in the adjudication of the distressed company into judicial winding-up. If the activities carried out by the debtor company appear to be clearly inappropriate to the preparation of the “full” application, the court may, _ex officio, after hearing the debtor and if appointed the judicial commissioner, reduce the time for the filing of additional documents. Following the filing of the simplified petition and until the decree of admission to the composition with creditors, the distressed company may: (i) carry out acts pertaining to its ordinary activity; and (ii) seek the court’s authorization to carry out acts pertaining to its non-recurring activity, to the extent they are urgent. Claims arising from acts lawfully carried out by the distressed company after the filing of the concordato preventivo petition (including preliminary petition) have super priority (prededucibilità) in case of a subsequent judicial winding-up. The concordato preventivo proposal may also provide, inter alia: (i) the continuation of the business by the debtor as going concern (concordato con continuità aziendale diretta), or (ii) the transfer of the business to one or more companies (concordato con continuità aziendale indiretta) as well as for a particular composition with creditors proceeding through which any assets that are no longer necessary to run the business of the company are liquidated (concordato misto). According to Article 84, paragraph 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the _concordato misto qualifies as a concordato con continuità aziendale, regardless the “portion” of business for which going concern is envisaged. In these cases, the plan and the petition for the concordato preventivo must fully describe the costs and revenue that are expected as a consequence of the continuation of the business as a going concern, as well as the financial resources and support which will be necessary. The report of the independent expert must also certify that the continuation of the business is conducive to the satisfaction of creditors’ claims to a greater extent than if such composition proposal was not implemented. Existing contracts, even if entered with governmental bodies, are automatically not to be terminated by admission to procedure. Furthermore, the going concern-based arrangements with creditors can provide for, among others, the winding up of those assets that are not functional to the business allowed. The composition agreement may also contain a proposed tax settlement for the partial or deferred payment of certain taxes. Under Article 100 of the Italian Insolvency Code, a debtor who files for a concordato pursuant to Articles 44 and 87 of the Italian Insolvency Code based on business continuity may request the court to be authorized to pay prefiling claims relating to the purchase of goods or services if an independent expert certifies that they are essential for business continuity and to ensure the best satisfaction of creditors. If the court determines that the composition proposal is admissible, it appoints a delegated judge (giudice delegato) to supervise the procedure, appoints one or more judicial officers (commissari giudiziali) and schedules a specific period of time during which creditors can express their vote. During the implementation of the proposal, the company generally continues to be managed by its corporate bodies (usually its board of directors), but is supervised by the appointed judicial officers and judge (who will authorize all transactions that exceed the ordinary course of business). Article 91 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, if the composition with creditors’ plan, includes an offer for the sale of the debtor’s assets or the sale of a going concern of the debtor to an identified third-party, the court or the delegated judge shall order that for appropriate publicity to be given to the offer itself in order to acquire competing offers (offerte concorrenti). If expressions of interest are received, the court or the delegated judge, by decree, shall order the opening of the competitive proceeding. Furthermore pursuant to Article 91, paragraph 4, the judicial decree referred above establishes the procedures for the submission of irrevocable offers, providing that in all cases, among others, the following is ensured: (a) their comparability, (b) the requirements for the participation of the bidders, (c) the forms and timing of access to relevant information, (d) any limits on their use, (e) the manner in which the judicial commissioner must provide them to those who request them, (f) the manner in which the competitive procedure is to be conducted, (g) the minimum increase in the consideration to be provided by the subsequent offers, (h) the guarantees to be given by the bidders, (i) the forms of publicity, and (l) the date of the hearing for the evaluation of the bids if the sale takes place before the court. With the sale or with the assignment, whichever is earlier, to a person other than the original bidder identified in the plan, the latter and the debtor are released from their obligations towards each other and accordingly the debtor shall amend the proposal and plan in accordance with the outcome of the competitive proceeding. The concordato preventivo is voted on within the period of time scheduled by the court and must be approved with the favorable vote of (a) the creditors representing the majority of the receivables admitted to vote and, also in the event that the plan provides for more classes of creditors, or (b) the majority of the receivables admitted to vote is reached the majority of the classes. Pursuant to Article 109, paragraph 1, of the Italian Insolvency Code, ----- in case one creditor holds more than the majority of receivables admitted to voting, it is also necessary to reach majority by headcount. The _concordato preventivo is approved only if the required majorities of creditors expressly voted in favor of the proposal. Creditors who did not exercise their voting right will be deemed not to approve the concordato preventivo proposal. In relation to voting by the holder of the Notes in the _concordato _proceedings, the interactions between (i) the provisions set forth under the Indenture with respect to meetings of_ holders of the Notes, the applicable majorities and the rights of each holder of the Notes to vote in the relevant meeting, and (ii) applicable Italian law provisions relating to quorum and majorities in meetings of holders of notes issued by Italian companies are largely untested in the Italian courts (recent case law has however affirmed the right of noteholders whose vote may be tainted by conflict of interest as could be the case of disenfranchised noteholders to be computed for the purposes of relevant quora and be admitted to vote, albeit in a specific class). Secured creditors are not entitled to vote on the proposal of concordato preventivo unless and to the extent they waive their security, or the concordato preventivo provides that they will not receive full satisfaction of the fair market value of their secured assets (such value being assessed by an independent expert), in which case they can vote only in respect of the part of their debt affected by the proposal. Among others, (i) the companies controlling the debtor, controlled by the debtor and those under the control of the entity controlling the debtor, (ii) the assignees of the claims of the entities under point (i), if the assignment has been perfected during the year preceding the _concordato, and (iii) creditors in conflict of interest are excluded from voting. The court may approve the concordato preventivo (notwithstanding the circumstance that one or more classes objected to it) if: (i) the majority of classes has approved it, and (ii) the court deems that the interests of the non-adhering creditors would be adequately safeguarded through it compared to other solutions (in particular in comparison with the judicial liquidation). If an objection to the implementation of the _concordato preventivo is filed by 20% of the creditors or, in case there are different classes of creditors, by a creditor belonging to a non-adhering class, entitled to vote, the court may nevertheless sanction the _concordato preventivo if it deems that the relevant creditors’ claims are likely to be satisfied to a greater extent as a result of the concordato preventivo than would otherwise be the case (including the judicial liquidation). The court approves the concordato preventivo even in the absence of a vote by the tax authority or by the social contribution entities (enti gestori di forme di previdenza o assistenza obbligatorie) when their positive vote is decisive for the purposes of achieving the majorities referred to in Article 109, paragraph 1 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also on the basis of the result of the report of the independent expert referred to in Article 88 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal to satisfy the aforesaid authorities and entities is convenient compared to a judicial liquidation scenario. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 90 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides for the possibility for creditors (except for individuals or entities controlled, controlling or under common control of the debtor) holding at least 10% of the aggregate claims against a debtor to present an alternative plan (proposta concorrente) to the debtor’s plan within 30 days prior from the related creditors’ vote on the debtor’s plan - in a court supervised composition with creditors proceedings (concordato preventivo) subject to certain conditions being met, including, in particular, that the proposal of the debtor does not ensure recovery of at least 30% of the unsecured claims (crediti _chirografari), considering also that such percentage is reduced to 20% in case the debtor has filed for a composizione negoziata provided for pursuant to Article 13 of the Italian Insolvency Code._ Differently from the general rules set out above, pursuant to Article 109 paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the composition with creditors on a going-concern basis (concordato con continuità), is approved if all the creditors’ classes vote in favor of such composition with creditors arrangement. In each class, the relevant composition with creditors’ proposal is approved if the majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted favorably, provided that the creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. In case of non-approval, Article 112, paragraph 2, of the Italian Insolvency Code shall apply. In this respect, it should be noted that secured creditors shall not vote if their claims are satisfied in cash, in full, within 180 days from the sanctioning (omologa) of the concordato con _continuità and provided that the security interests supporting the related claims remains firm until the winding-_ up, functional to their satisfaction. In case of claims of employees or other claims secured under Article 2751-bis of the Italian Civil Code, the delay is reduced to 30 days from the approval by the court. Pursuant to Article 112, paragraph 5 of the Italian Insolvency Code, after the approval of the _concordato _preventivo proposal, non-adhering creditors (or creditors belonging to a non-adhering class) representing 20% or_ more of the liabilities may file an opposition (opposizione), challenging the economic convenience of the plan. In such case, the court has the authority to “cram-down” non-adhering creditors, compelling their acceptance of the plan, if it deems that the proposed treatment of their claims is equivalent to what they would recover in a judicial winding-up scenario. After the creditors’ approval, the court approves the composition with creditors and appoints one or more liquidators in order to execute the approved plan if it has to be realized by way of a transfer of assets. ----- The court may grant special powers to the judicial commissioner to implement the plan if the debtor does not cooperate, including by taking all corporate actions required. Pursuant to Article 111 of the Italian Insolvency Code, if the creditors do not approve the concordato preventivo, the delegated judge (giudice delegato) shall promptly inform the court which, having decided that the appropriate conditions apply, shall declare the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding. The terms and the performance of the outstanding contracts which have been entered into, from time to time, by the debtor are not automatically affected by the concordato preventivo proceeding and normally continue pending the procedure, any agreement to the contrary being ineffective. However, pursuant to Article 97 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the debtor may request the competent court to be authorized to terminate outstanding agreements (contratti ancora ineseguiti o non compiutamente eseguiti) if the continuation of such agreements is inconsistent with the prospects and the execution of the composition with creditors’ plan, except for certain agreements which are excluded from the scope of the above provision (e.g., employment agreements (rapporti di lavoro _subordinato), residential real estate preliminary sale agreements (contratti preliminari di vendita aventi ad oggetto immobili ad uso abitativo) and real estate lease agreements (contratti di locazione di immobili)). The request may_ be filed with the competent court at the time of the filing of the application for the concordato preventivo or to the delegated judge (giudice delegato), if the application is made after admission to the procedure. Upon the debtor’s request, the pending agreements can also be suspended for a period of time (a) between 30 and 60 days from the date of the filing of the preliminary petition, subject to only one possible further extension of up to 60 days, where there are reasonable grounds for such extension (giustificati motivi) or in the event where filings for a judicial liquidation proceeding are pending, renewable just once. When the composition proposal together with the relevant plan have been submitted, the suspension may also be authorized by the court for a further duration, which, however, may not exceed thirty days from the date of the decree opening the procedure, which may not be further extended. In such circumstances, the other party has the right to receive an indemnification equivalent to the damages suffered for the non-fulfillment of the agreement. Such indemnification would be paid prior to and outside of the admission to the concordato preventivo procedure. Pursuant to Articles 119 and 120 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in the event of a breach of the composition with creditors plan or fraud, provided that the relevant requirements are met, the _concordato can be terminated or annulled, as the case may be, upon petition of one or more of the creditors and the judicial liquidation may follow, at the behest of the relevant court. if the composition with creditors is implemented, terms and conditions of payments are amended as per the concordato proposal, and the debtor may return to its usual operations (if the assets of the company are still in his possession). Concordato preventivo is compulsory for all creditors prior to the publication of the application in the companies’ register. However, creditors retain without prejudice their rights against co-debtors and guarantors of the debtor. In case of non-minor breaches, the _concordato may be terminated by each of the creditors or the judicial commissioner (in case of petition by one or more of the creditors). The relevant lawsuit must be brought within one year from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the concordato itself. The concordato may also be annulled upon request of the judicial commissioner or of one or more creditors in case a portion of the assets of the debtor has been concealed or the liabilities have been willfully exaggerated. The relevant lawsuit must be brought within six months from the discovery of the concealment/exaggeration and, in any event, within two years from the deadline originally scheduled for the last activity to be carried out under the _concordato itself._",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The aim at preserving the value of the company as a going concern and maximizing creditor’s repayment are the main goals both of the previous legal framework and the Italian Insolvency Code. However, the new provisions under the Italian Insolvency Code remove some uncertainties and clarifies some debated issues. In addition, the provisions under the Italian Bankruptcy Law focused mainly on the perspective of creditors already having claims against the company to avoid that the expectations of recovery of such claims were reduced due to the potential considerable increase in super senior (so-called “prededucibili”) claims and, to this extent, granted a preeminent role to the independent expert together with the court authorization procedures. Unlike the former legal framework, the new provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code focus more on preserving the business ----- value of the distressed company as a going concern by strengthening the key role of the financing of the debtor in the context of the relevant proceedings.

Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the Italian Insolvency Code, the claims deriving from such financings are expressly qualified as super senior by law and by Article 6(2) of the Italian Insolvency Code which clarifies that their super senior ranking natures continues in the context of any subsequent insolvency or enforcement proceedings (including in a judicial liquidation or any so-called minor proceedings). As already explained above, super senior ranking nature of such financings will be excluded in case of acts of fraud (which may be relevant also in the context of debt restructuring agreements). Such limit to super senior ranking is regulated differently for interim financings and bridge financings on the one side and for the implementation financings on the other side. More specifically, for interim financings or bridge financings false data or omission of relevant information are relevant when found by the court in the request for the incurrence of the financings or the attestation of the independent expert, whilst for implementation financings such elements are relevant when on included in plan underlying the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement. With reference to interim financings and bridge financings, Article 99 Paragraph 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides that, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation, such financings (although authorized by the court in the context of the composition with creditors or the debt restructuring agreement) do not benefit from super senior ranking when it is proved (jointly) that: (a) the request or the independent expert report contains false data or omits relevant information, or when the debtor has committed acts to defraud creditors in order to obtain the authorization; and (b) the receiver proves that the entities who provided the financing, at the date of issuance, knew the aforementioned circumstances. With reference to implementation financings, the relevant provisions are set out in Article 101 Paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code providing that such financings do not benefit from the super senior ranking, in case of the opening of a judicial liquidation (alternatively): (a) when, based on an assessment to be made at the time of filing of the petition for the opening of the proceeding, the plan underlying the composition with creditors or debt restructuring agreement turns out to be based on false data or on the omission of relevant information; or (b) when the debtor has carried out acts of fraud towards its creditors and the receiver proves that the lenders providing the financings were aware of such circumstances at the time of the establishment of the financings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In this regard, it should be noted that recourse to this instrument will be reserved for a debtor in crisis or insolvent that plans to satisfy its creditors by dividing them into classes according to homogeneous legal positions and economic interests. This instrument allows the plan’s proceeds to be distributed even in derogation of the principle of “par condicio _creditorum” (i.e., the equal treatment of creditors), provided that the proposal is approved by unanimous consent_ of the classes. A judgement of admissibility is provided for by the court, which is called upon to assess the proposal’s timeliness and to verify the correctness of the class formation criteria. Application for the approval by the court of a restructuring plan must follow the steps of the common framework applicable to all restructuring tools and frameworks (i.e., concordato preventivo, debt restructuring agreement and also to judicial liquidation). The regulation of the restructuring plan subject to homologation _(piano di _ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), from the date of submission of the application until its approval, is_ based on the model of the negotiated crisis settlement: the entrepreneur maintains the ordinary and extraordinary management of the company in the prevailing interest of the creditors under the supervision of the court commissioner. The debtor is, in any case, allowed to amend the application at any time, formulating the proposal of composition (concordato preventivo). In that case, the time limit for approval is shortened. Similarly, the debtor that has filed an application for composition with creditors may amend the application by applying for approval of the restructuring plan provided that the application is made before voting commences. In each class, the proposal is approved if a majority of the claims allowed to vote is reached or, failing that, if two-thirds of the claims of the voting creditors have voted in favour, provided that creditors holding at least half of the total claims of the same class have voted. The court will approve the restructuring plan in the event of approval by all classes. If a dissenting creditor objects to the proposal, the court will approve and homologate the restructuring plan if the proposal satisfies the claim to a not lesser extent than the one resulting from a judicial liquidation. A creditor that has not objected to the lack of convenience in its observations may not file an objection referred before, unless it proves such the lack of objection was due to a cause not attributable to it. In summary the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) thus represents for the debtor an opportunity instrument which minimizes the admissibility phase, providing greater freedom of action, but requiring the approval of all classes of creditors in order to be effectively approved. Against the judgment of the court ruling on the approval of the restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione), the parties may file an appeal to the competent court of appeal within the term of 30 days from the notification of the relevant judgement of the court.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

It results in the company’s liquidation. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, also evidenced by defaults and/or external elements, occurs when a debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. The judicial liquidation is declared by the competent court and is applicable only to commercial enterprises (imprenditori commerciali) if any of the following thresholds are met: the company (i) has had assets (attivo patrimoniale) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.3 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, (ii) has had gross revenue (ricavi lordi) in an aggregate amount exceeding €0.2 million for each of the three preceding fiscal years, and (iii) has total indebtedness (including debts not yet due) in excess of €0.5 million. Pursuant to Article 37 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the request to commence the judicial liquidation of the debtor company’s assets can be filed by (i) the debtor company itself, (ii) the administrative bodies and authorities that have control and supervisory functions over the company, (iii) by one or more of the debtor’s creditors and (iv) in certain cases, by the public prosecutor. ----- Upon the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings, amongst other things: - subject to certain exceptions, all actions of creditors are stayed, and creditors must file claims within a defined period. In particular, under certain circumstances, secured creditors may enforce against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as secured claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of the secured assets, together with interest and expenses. Any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank _pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. The secured creditor may sell the secured asset only after it has obtained authorization from the delegated judge (giudice delegato). After hearing the judicial receiver and the creditors’ committee, the delegated judge decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the timing in its decision; - under certain circumstances secured creditors may execute against the secured property as soon as their claims are admitted as preferred claims. Secured claims are paid out of the proceeds of liquidation of the secured assets, together with the applicable interest and subject to any relevant expenses. In case the sale price is not high enough to determine a full satisfaction of their credits, any outstanding balance will be considered unsecured and rank pari passu with all of the debtor’s other unsecured debt. Secured creditors may sell the secured asset only with the court authorization. After hearing the judicial receiver (curatore) and the creditors’ committee, the court decides whether to authorize the sale, and sets forth the relevant timing in his or her decision; - the payments of all debts and liabilities of the debtor and all the acts, transactions, payments made or received by the insolvent debtor are immediately suspended and formalities with third parties that have been carried out after the declaration of insolvency are not effective as regards the creditors of the debtor (Article 145 of Italian Insolvency Code); - the debtor is dispossessed, and the administration of the debtor and the management of its assets are transferred to the judicial receiver (curatore). The debtor may no longer validly act in court as claimant or defendant in relation to the assets (Article 142 of the Italian Insolvency Code). The judicial receiver is vested with such powers upon the authorization of the delegated judge. However, all pending proceedings in which the debtor is involved are automatically stayed from the date the adjudication is issued and need to be re-initiated by or against the judicial receiver; - the beginning of the judicial winding-up involves the cessation of all the activities of the company with a view to a sale of all assets. However, continuation of business may be authorized by the court if the continuation of the company’s business does not cause damage to creditors. If the competent court authorizes the continuation of the business (esercizio provvisorio dell’impresa), the management of the business is entrusted to the judicial receiver (who may in turn avail himself of qualified third parties for this purpose); - certain payments made, security interests given or transactions entered into by the debtor in a certain period before the debtor’s submission to a judicial winding-up procedure (varying from six months to two years) can be set aside and clawed back if certain conditions are met (provided for pursuant to Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code); - any act (including payments, pledges, and issuance of guarantees) made by the debtor after (and in certain cases even before for a limited period of time) the commencement of the proceedings, other than those made through the receiver, become ineffective against creditors; and - the execution of certain contracts and/or transactions pending as of the date of the insolvency declaration are suspended until the receiver decides whether to take them over. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to either continue or terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed by both parties, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for the Italian Insolvency Code. In order to overcome the uncertainty that may predictably arise, the contractual counterparty may file a written petition requiring the Court to give the judicial receiver (curatore) a deadline of no more than 60 days; within such deadline, the receiver must decide to enter into the agreement or withdraw from it. Upon expiration of the deadline without the judicial receiver having replied to the counterparty’s request, the pending agreement is deemed terminated. Although the general rule is that the judicial receiver is allowed to terminate contracts where some or all of the obligations have not been performed, certain contracts are subject to specific rules expressly provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code. ----- Judicial liquidation proceedings, as per the former bankruptcy proceedings under Italian Bankruptcy Law, are carried out and supervised by a court-appointed judicial receiver, a delegated judge (giudice delegato) and a creditors’ committee (comitato dei creditori). The judicial receiver is not a representative of the creditors and is responsible for the liquidation of the assets of the debtor to the satisfaction of creditors. The proceeds from the liquidation are distributed in accordance with statutory priority rights (see below in the section). The liquidation of a debtor can take a considerable amount of time, particularly in cases where the debtor’s assets include real estate property. Furthermore, the parties of a judicial winding-up proceeding as well as any interested party, may file an appeal (opposizione) to the decree closing the judicial winding-up proceeding within 30 days after having been notified of the same.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

By way of preliminary note, such agreement occurring in the context of a judicial liquidation proceeding (i) replaced the former proceeding defined as “concordato fallimentare”, a composition with creditors agreement occurring in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding (fallimento) formerly provided for under Article 124, paragraph 1 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law and (ii) should be kept distinct from the concordato _preventivo, which is an independent insolvency proceeding. This particular composition with creditor agreement_ arrangement benefits in a certain way both the debtor as well as the creditors, in fact while the former is released of the debts falling into the relevant plan also regaining free disposal of his assets, the latter is satisfied faster and to a greater extent than they would have been with the full completion of the judicial liquidation process pertaining to the debtor’s assets. The creditor, a third-party or the debtor himself formulates a proposal having as its object a “plan” to satisfy creditors, including preferential creditors, in full or in part. In case the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is proposed by the debtor, such proposal, inter alia, (i) shall be filed after 1 year from the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding, and (ii) shall provide for the contribution by the debtor of resources that increase the value of the debtor’s assets by at least 10%. Such proposal shall be submitted to the competent judge, shall then be approved by the creditors and finally by the court. In case the court’s decree approving the _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale becomes final (definitivo), the court declares the judicial liquidation to be closed and terminated, initiating the enactment phase of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. In the context of a concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale, the competent court supervises both the proposal and execution phases while the judicial receiver (curatore), once the liquidation is closed, loses his management functions and retains only supervisory duties over the fulfillment of the terms and the conditions of the arrangement obligations arising from or in connection with the aforementioned concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale. Pursuant to Article 240, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the proposal may provide for: - the division of creditors into classes, according to homogeneous legal position and economic interests. Under the relevant provision, such division is not mandatory but discretionary, provided two criteria for the class identification: (a) legal position, i.e., the nature of the claim, e.g., unsecured or preferential and (b) the homogeneous economic interests. In this respect, the Italian Insolvency Code requires for the criteria and rationale for the division into classes to be expressly stated in order to avoid the distorted use of class formation, put in place for the sole purpose of obtaining the approval of the abovementioned proposal; - differential treatment between creditors belonging to different classes, indicating the reasons of such differences; - the restructuring of the financial indebtedness of the debtor as well as the satisfaction of claims in any form possible, by way of example: (1) by assignment of assets; (2) by assumption (accollo); ----- (3) by means of other extraordinary transactions, including the assignment to creditors (as well as to companies in which they have an interest), of shares, quotas or bonds, including those convertible into shares or other financial instruments and debt securities. It should be noted that a special feature of the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is the option to provide that secured creditors may not be satisfied in full. However, it is necessary for the plan to provide for their satisfaction to a non-lesser extent than that the one which can be realized, by reason of preferential placement, from the relevant proceeds in the event of a judicial liquidation, having regard to the market value attributable to the assets or rights over which the cause of pre-emption exists. The _concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale proposal must be approved by the creditors’ committee and the creditors holding the simple majority (by value) of claims (and, if classes are formed, by a majority (by value) of the claims in the majority of the classes). However, in the event of dissent by more than one creditor’s class, a cram-down may occur (i.e., in case the court decides to approve the concordato - despite a creditor belonging to a dissenting class contests the appropriateness of the proposal - if it finds that the claims can be satisfied by the _concordato to a non-lesser extent than the practicable alternatives. Final court confirmation and sanctioning_ (omologazione) is also required. Finally, once approved and sanctioned (omologato) by the court the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale is mandatory: - for all existing creditors prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding; and - for creditors who have not applied for the admission to the judicial liquidation estate, to whom the guarantees or the security interests given in the concordato nella liquidazione giudiziale by third parties do not extend. With the termination of the judicial liquidation - as a consequence of the sanctioning decree (decreto di _omologa), which pursuant to Article 247 of the Italian Insolvency Code may be challenged and appealed within_ 30 days from its notification - the debtor returns “in bonis” and enjoys the renewed availability of its assets. - **Statutory priorities. The statutory priority assigned to creditors under the Italian Insolvency Code may be different from the priorities in the United States, the United Kingdom and certain other EU jurisdictions. The proceeds of liquidation shall be allocated according to the following order: (i) for payments of super senior “predeductible” (prededucibili) claims (i.e., claims originated in the insolvency proceeding, such as costs related to the procedure) as better identified in Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (ii) for payment of claims which are privileged (privilegiati), such as claims of secured creditors, and (iii) for the payment of unsecured (chirografari) creditors’ claims. Under Italian law, the highest priority claims (after the costs of the proceedings are paid) are the claims of preferential creditors, including, _inter alia, a claim whose priority is legally acquired (i.e., repayment of rescue or interim financing) the claims of the Italian tax authorities and social security administrators, and claims for employee wages. The remaining priorities of claims are, in order of priority, those related to secured creditors (creditori privilegiati; a preference in payment in most circumstances, but not exclusively, provided for by law), mortgages (creditori ipotecari), pledges (creditori prignoratizi) and, lastly, unsecured creditors (crediti chirografari). Under Italian law, the proceeds from the sale of the debtor’s estate are distributed according to legal rules of priority. Neither the debtor nor the court can deviate from these priority rules by proposing their own priorities of claims or by subordinating one claim to another based on equitable subordination principles (as a consequence it must be noted that priority of payments such as those commonly provided in intercreditor contractual arrangements may not be enforceable against an Italian judicial liquidation estate to the extent they are inconsistent with the priorities provided by law). The law creates a hierarchy of claims that must be adhered to when distributing the proceeds derived from the sale of the entire debtor’s estate or part thereof, or from a single asset. In particular, pursuant to Article 6 of the Italian Insolvency Code, in addition to claims expressly qualified as “prededucibili” under Italian law, among others, the following claims are “prededucibili”: (1) claims relating to expenses and fees for services rendered by the business crisis settlement body; (2) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing for the approval of a restructuring plan subject to homologation, the debt restructuring agreements and for the ----- application for protective measures, to the extent of 75% of the assessed claim and provided that the abovementioned plan or agreements are approved and homologated; (3) professional claims arising from or in connection with the filing of for a court supervised composition with creditors procedure as well as the filing of the related proposal and the plan accompanying it, within the limits of 75% of the ascertained claims and provided that the proceedings are opened pursuant to Article 47 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (4) claims legally arisen in connection with insolvency proceedings for the management of the debtor’s assets and the continuation of the business of the company as well as arising from the professional services required by the related bodies. - **Avoidance powers in insolvency. A fundamental principle of the Italian Insolvency Code is the equal treatment of all creditors (“par condicio creditorum”), according to which, absent statutory priorities or security right, no creditor may be paid a higher percentage of his claim than other creditors. A consequence of this principle is not only that the payment of debts by the judicial receiver is strictly regulated, but also that all transactions effected by the debtor over the previous year (or, in certain cases, over the previous six months) are scrutinized and potentially unwound as preferential. Similar to other jurisdictions, there are so-called “claw-back” or avoidance provisions under Italian law that may give rise, inter alia, to the revocation of payments or to the granting of security interests made by the debtor prior to the declaration of insolvency. The key avoidance provisions include, but are not limited to, transactions made below market value, preferential transactions and transactions made with a view to defraud creditors. Claw-back rules under Italian law are normally considered to be particularly favorable to the receiver in judicial winding-up compared to the rules applicable in other jurisdictions. In insolvency proceedings, depending on the circumstances, the Italian Insolvency Code provides for a claw-back period of up to two years (six months in certain circumstances) and a two-year ineffectiveness period for certain other transactions. In the context of extraordinary administration procedures (as described below), the claw-back period may last up to three or five years in certain circumstances. The Italian Insolvency Code distinguishes between acts or transactions which are ineffective by operation of law and acts or transactions which are voidable at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner, as detailed below. - **Acts ineffective by operation of law. Under (i) Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exception, all transactions entered into for no consideration are ineffective _vis-à-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding or in the prior two-year period, and (B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial liquidation declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. - **Acts that may be avoided at the request of the judicial receiver/court commissioner. The following acts and transactions, if done or made during the period specified below, may be clawed back (revocati) _vis-à-vis the debtor as provided for by Article 166 of the Italian Insolvency Code and be declared_ ineffective, unless the non-insolvent party proves that it had no actual or constructive knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into: (1) onerous transactions carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year, where the value of the debt or the obligations undertaken by the debtor exceeds 25% of the value of the consideration received by and/or promised to the debtor; ----- (2) payments of debts, due and payable, made by the debtor which were not paid in cash or by other customary means of payment which were carried out after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the previous year; (3) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the year prior, in order to secure pre-existing debts which were not yet due at the time the new security was granted; and (4) pledges and mortgages granted by the debtor after the filing followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or in the six months prior in order to secure pre-existing debts which had already fallen due at the time the new security was granted. Furthermore, payments of debts that are immediately due and payable and any onerous transactions and/or granting of priority rights/security interests for debts simultaneously created (event those of third-parties) may be clawed back (revocati) and declared ineffective, if the judicial receiver proves that the other party knew of the debtor’s state of insolvency and if made by the debtor after the filing of the petition followed by the opening of the judicial liquidation or during the prior six months. The following transactions are exempt from claw-back actions: (1) payments for goods or services made in the ordinary course of business according to market practice; (2) a remittance on a bank account, provided that it does not materially and permanently reduce the entity’s debt towards the bank; (3) the sale, including an agreement for sale registered pursuant to Article 2645-bis of the Italian Civil Code, in force as the date of this offering memorandum, made for a fair value and concerning a residential property that is intended as the main residence of the purchaser or the purchaser’s family (within three degrees of kinship) or a non-residential property that is intended as the main seat of the enterprise of the purchaser; provided that, as at the date of the insolvency declaration, the activity is actually exercised therein or the investments for the commencement of such activity have been carried out therein; (4) transactions entered into, payments made or guarantees granted with respect to the debtor’s goods, provided that they concern the implementation of a piano attestato di risanamento (see “Out-of-court reorganization plans (piani attestati di risanamento) pursuant to Articles 56 or _284 of the Italian Insolvency Code” above);_ (5) a transaction entered into, payment made or guarantee or security interests granted in the context of a court supervised composition with creditors (concordato preventivo), of a restructuring plan subject to homologation (piano di ristrutturazione soggetto ad omologazione) provided for pursuant to Article 64-bis of the Italian Insolvency Code or of sanctioned debt restructuring agreements with creditors (accordi di ristrutturazione dei debiti omologati) and/or transactions entered into, payments made and security interests legitimately granted by the debtor after the filing of the application for a _concordato preventivo or of an_ _accordo di ristrutturazione dei _debiti (see above);_ (6) remuneration payments to the entity’s employees and consultants concerning work carried out by them; and (7) payments of a debt that is immediately due, payable and made on the due date, with respect to services necessary for access to a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring framework (see below under “pre-judicial liquidation restructuring frameworks (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e _dell’insolvenza della società)”) or to other insolvency procedures provided for pursuant to the_ Italian Insolvency Code. Pursuant to Article 170 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the limitation period for initiating claw-back action proceedings is three years from the opening of the judicial liquidation procedure or, if earlier, five years from the act or transaction to be clawed back. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor be declared ineffective within the ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria) provided for by the Italian Civil Code. In this respect, under Article 2901 of the Italian Civil Code, a creditor may demand that transactions whereby the entity disposed ----- of its assets prejudicially to such creditor’s rights be declared ineffective with respect to such creditor, provided that the debtor was aware of such prejudice (or, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, that such transaction was fraudulently entered into by the debtor for the purpose of prejudicing the creditors) and that, in the case of a transaction entered into for consideration with a third person, the third person was aware of such prejudice (and, if the transaction was entered into prior to the date on which the claim was originated, such third person participated in the fraudulent design). The burden of proof is entirely with the receiver. The Italian Insolvency Code provides special regimes on preferences and avoidances of intra-group transactions. Under Article 290 of the Italian Insolvency Code the limitation period of initiating intra-group claw-back actions (referring to acts and transactions entered into by companies belonging to the same group that jeopardize the creditors’ interest) is extended to five years from the filing for judicial winding-up declaration. Law 132/2015 also introduced new Article 2929-bis to the Italian Civil Code, providing for a “simplified” clawback action for the creditor with respect to certain types of transactions put in place by the debtor with the aim to subtract (registered) assets from the attachment by its creditors. In particular, the creditor can now start enforcement proceedings over the relevant assets without previously obtaining a Court decision clawing back/ nullifying the relevant (fraudulent) transaction, to the extent that such transaction had been carried out without consideration (e.g., gratuitous transfers, or creation of shield instruments such as trusts or the so called _fondo _patrimoniale or “family trust”). In case of gratuitous transfers, the enforcement action can also be carried out by_ the creditor against the third-party purchaser. Finally, as noted above, the Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. - **Adequate organizational, administrative and accounting corporate structures. One of the main novelties included in the Italian Insolvency Code concerns the definition of the organizational, administrative and accounting structures of a company which are deemed to be adequate under Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, required by the applicable regulations for the purpose of timely detection of the state of crisis and the undertaking of suitable initiatives by the debtor. Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code requires the entrepreneur to adopt an appropriate organizational structure in accordance with Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, for the purpose of timely detection of the crisis of the company as well as the timely undertaking of suitable initiatives to overcome the crisis and recover business continuity. However, neither the aforementioned Article 3, in its current wording, nor Article 2086 of the Italian Civil Code, as amended by the Italian Insolvency Code, contains a precise description of the parameters, conditions and characteristics that are deemed to be necessary/needed for the definition and especially for the identification of “adequate structures.” In this regard, Article 3 of the Italian Insolvency Code precisely enunciates, on the one hand, the purposes to which the measures and structures must aim in order to be considered as adequate for the timely detection of the crisis and, on the other hand, the relevant warning signs in relation to the same. In this respect, it is stipulated that, for the purpose of the timely detection of the company’s state of crisis, the measures and structures deemed to be adequate should make it possible to: (1) detect any imbalances of an equity or economic-financial nature, related to the specific characteristics of the company as well as to the business activity carried out by the debtor; (2) verify the non-sustainability of debts and the absence of prospects for business continuity for the next twelve months as well as the warning signs identified by Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code; and (3) derive the information necessary to follow the detailed checklist and conduct the practical test for the reasonable pursuit of the debtor’s financial recovery. For the sake of completeness and as set out above, it should also be noted that Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code provides an exact indication of the warning signs, identified, inter alia, as follows: (1) the existence of payroll debts overdue for at least 30 days equal to more than half of the total monthly payroll amount; (2) the existence of receivables owed to suppliers that are at least 90 days past due in an amount greater than the amount of receivables that are not past due; ----- (3) the existence of exposures to banks and other financial intermediaries that have been past due for more than 60 days or have exceeded the limit of credit facilities obtained in any form for at least 60 days provided that they represent in the aggregate at least 5% of the total exposures; and (4) the existence of one or more exposures to certain public institutions listed under Article 25novies of the Italian Insolvency Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

To be eligible, companies must be insolvent although able to demonstrate serious recovery prospects, have employed at least 200 employees in the previous year preceding the commencement of the procedure, and have debts equal to at least two-thirds of its assets as shown in its financial statements and two-thirds of its income deriving from sales and services during its last financial year. The procedure may be commenced by petition of the creditors, the debtor, a court or the public prosecutor. The same rules set forth for judicial winding-up proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to an extraordinary administration proceeding. Preferential payment is granted to those credits (even unsecured) accrued to allow the conduct of the company’s business activity. Extraordinary administration procedures involve two main phases—a judicial phase and an administrative phase. Judicial Phase. In the judicial phase, the court determines whether the company meets the admission criteria and whether it is insolvent. It then issues a decision to that effect and appoints up to three judicial receivers (commissario giudiziale) to investigate whether there are serious prospects for recovery via a business sale or reorganization. The judicial receiver submit(s) a report to the court (within 30 days) together with an opinion from the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (the “Ministry”). The court has 30 days to decide whether to admit the company to the procedure or place it into judicial winding-up. Administrative Phase. If the company is admitted to the extraordinary administration procedure, the administrative phase begins, and the extraordinary commissioner(s) appointed by the Ministry prepare a restructuring plan. The plan can provide either for the sale of the business as a going concern within one year (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Disposal Plan”) or a reorganization leading to the company’s economic and financial recovery within two years (unless extended by the Ministry) (the “Recovery Plan”). It may also include a composition with creditors (concordato). The plan must be approved by the Ministry within 30 days from submission by the extraordinary commissioner(s). In addition, the extraordinary commissioner draws up a report every six months on the financial condition and interim management of the company and sends it to the Ministry. The procedure ends upon successful completion of either a Disposal Plan or a Recovery Plan; however, should either plan fail, the company will be declared insolvent.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

It is complementary to the Prodi-bis procedure and, except as otherwise provided, the same provisions apply. The Marzano procedure is intended to work faster than the Prodi-bis procedure. For example, although a company must be insolvent, the application to the Ministry can be made before the court commences the administrative phase. The Marzano procedure only applies to large insolvent companies which, on a consolidated basis, have at least 500 employees in the year before the procedure is commenced and at least €300 million of debt (including those from outstanding guarantees). The decision whether to open a Marzano procedure is taken by the Ministry following the debtor’s request (who must also file an application for the declaration of insolvency). The Ministry assesses whether the relevant requirements are met and then appoints the extraordinary commissioner(s) who will manage the company. The court also decides on the company’s insolvency. The extraordinary commissioner(s) has/have 180 days (or 270 days if the Ministry so agrees) to submit a Disposal Plan or Recovery Plan. The restructuring through the Disposal Plan or the Recovery Plan must be completed within, respectively, one year (extendable to two years) and two years. If no Disposal or Recovery Plan is approved by the Ministry, the court will declare the company insolvent and open judicial winding-up proceedings. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

It is irrelevant whether these companies belong to the public or the private sector. A compulsory administrative winding-up is special insolvency proceedings in that the entity is liquidated not by the court but by the relevant administrative authority that oversees the industry in which the entity is active. The procedure may be triggered not only by the insolvency of the relevant entity, but also by other grounds expressly provided for by the relevant legal provisions (e.g., in respect of Italian banks, serious irregularities concerning the management of the bank or serious violations of the applicable legal, administrative or statutory provisions). The effect of this procedure is that the entity loses control over its assets and a liquidator (commissario liquidatore) is appointed to wind up the company by the relevant governmental authority (e.g., the Bank of Italy or the Ministry of Economic Development, which are competent for the filing of an application for a declaration of insolvency with the subsequent opening of the compulsory administrative winding-up proceeding). The liquidator’s actions are monitored by a steering committee (comitato di sorveglianza). The powers assigned to the designated judge and the court under the other insolvency proceedings are assumed by the relevant administrative authority under this procedure. The effect of the forced administrative winding-up on creditors is largely the same as under insolvency proceedings and includes, for example, a ban on enforcement measures. The same rules set forth for insolvency proceedings with respect to existing contracts and creditors’ claims largely apply to a compulsory administrative winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Among other things, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code and the purposes of a successful restructuring, the plan may provide for “any modification of the articles of association of the debtor company, including capital increases and reductions, including with limitation or exclusion of the option right and other modifications that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights, as well as for mergers, demergers and transformations.” Shareholders, who may no longer have an interest in the company, are prevented from hindering the restructuring or even one of its stages. For this reason, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the shareholders, while retaining a right to information in relation to both the initiation and the progress of the restructuring process, may not remove the directors without just cause, as is the case for the statutory auditors of joint stock companies, also in light of the fact that under the provisions of the Italian Insolvency Code it is not considered as being just cause for directors’ removal, the filing for access to the prejudicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) when the related legal conditions and requirements are met. However, pursuant to Article 120-bis, paragraph 5, shareholders representing at least 10% of the filing company’s corporate capital may make a competing proposal. The plan may provide for the formation of one class of shareholders or several classes if there are shareholders to whom different rights are granted by the by-laws, including as a result of the changes provided for in the plan. The formation of classes is, however, mandatory if the plan provides for changes that directly affect the shareholders’ participation rights and, in any case, for large companies and companies with widespread capital. In this context, special conditions for approval of the arrangement are set out pursuant to Article 120-quater of the Italian Insolvency Code when and if the plan provides for shareholder attributions. Specific rules are then provided to ensure that creditors’ interests are protected in all cases in which the restructuring tool envisages shareholders to retain a participation in the company with a certain value. Article 120-quinquies of the Italian Insolvency Code, regulates the execution phase of such measure. In order to avoid any obstructive attitude of the shareholders towards the approval of the restructuring tool, this provision expressly excludes the necessity for their approval and/or resolution on the implementation of such restructuring tool, by generally attributing the relevant powers to the directors or more specifically to the competent court, in relation to any amendment to the debtor’s by-laws which - being specifically provided for by the plan - do not require any discretionary resolution. Finally, it is stipulated that changes in the corporate structure resulting from the implementation of a pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e ----- _dell’insolvenza) shall not be considered as and constitute cause for the termination or amendment of any_ agreement entered into by the debtor with third parties. Articles 284 and ff. of the Italian Insolvency Code contain specific rules regarding (i) the access of a group to one of the pre-judicial liquidation restructuring tools (strumenti di regolazione della crisi e dell’insolvenza) aiming at unifying – to the extent possible – the relevant proceedings; (ii) liability lawsuits available to the receiver; and (iii) subordination of claims.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

In addition, in certain cases, the judicial receiver can request that certain transactions of the debtor are declared ineffective within the Italian Civil Code ordinary claw-back period of five years (revocatoria ordinaria). Under Italian law, in the event that the relevant guarantor and/or security provider enters into insolvency proceedings, the security interests created under the documents entered into to secure the Collateral and any future security interests or guarantees could be subject to potential challenges by an insolvency administrator or by other creditors of such guarantor and/or security provider under the rules of avoidance or claw-back (revocatoria) provided for pursuant to the Italian Insolvency Code and the relevant law on the non-insolvency avoidance or claw-back of transactions by the debtor made during a certain legally specified suspect period. The avoidance may relate to (i) transactions made by the debtor within the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, at below market value (i.e., to the extent the asset or obligation given or undertaken exceeds by one quarter the value of the consideration received by the debtor), or involving unusual means of payment (e.g., payment in kind) or new security granted with respect to pre-existing debts not yet due at the time the security is entered into after the creation of the secured obligations, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, (ii) security granted during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation with respect to pre-existing debts due and payable, unless the non-insolvent creditor proves that it had no knowledge of the debtor’s insolvency at the time the transaction was entered into, and (iii) payments of due and payable obligations, transactions at arm’s length or security taken simultaneously to the creation of the secured obligations during the suspect period of one year prior to the opening of the judicial liquidation proceeding or occurred after the filing for the opening of the judicial liquidation, if the judicial receiver proves that the creditor was aware of the insolvency of the debtor. In case judicial liquidation is commenced after the filing of a petition to be admitted to any insolvency proceedings, according to Article 170, paragraph 2 of the Italian Insolvency Code, the suspect period is calculated backward from the date in which such petition is filed. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by a Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by a guarantor and/or security provider. If they are challenged successfully, the rights granted under the guarantees or in connection with security interests under the relevant Security Documents may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. To the extent that the grant of any security interest is voided, holders of the Notes could lose the benefit of the security interest and may not be able to recover any amounts under the related Security Documents. It should be noted that: (i) under Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code, subject to certain limited exceptions, all transactions carried out by the debtor for no consideration are ineffective vis-a-vis creditors if entered into by the debtor after the filing to the relevant court followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up procedure or within the two years preceding the opening of such insolvency proceeding. Any asset subject to a transaction which is ineffective pursuant to Article 163 of the Italian Insolvency Code becomes part of the liquidation estate by operation of law upon registration (trascrizione) of the court’s decision opening the insolvency proceeding, without needing to wait for the ineffectiveness of the transaction to be sanctioned by a court. Any interested person may challenge the registration before the delegated judge as a violation of law, and (ii) under Article 164 of the Italian Insolvency Code, (A) payments of receivables falling due on the day of the of the judicial declaration of opening of the judicial liquidation or later, if they were executed by the debtor after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the judicial winding-up proceedings insolvency declaration or in the prior two-year period; and B) payments made by the debtor with respect to any intercompany loan within one year prior to a judicial winding-up declaration (or after the filing of the application followed by the opening of the winding-up proceeding), are ineffective vis-à-vis creditors. In addition, as noted above, the EU Insolvency Regulation contains conflicts of law rules which replace the various national rules of private international law in relation to insolvency proceedings within the European Union. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The two primary aims of the Italian Insolvency Code are to liquidate the debtor’s assets and protect the goodwill of the going concern (if any) for the satisfaction of creditors’ claims. The aim of the “Prodi-bis” procedure or “Marzano” procedure (which remain available to large companies also in the context of the new set of rules, as will be further detailed below), is to maintain employment. These competing aims often have been balanced by ----- the sale of businesses as going concerns and ensuring that employees are transferred along with the businesses being sold. Under the Italian Insolvency Code, the judicial liquidation (liquidazione giudiziale) must be declared by a court, based on the insolvency (insolvenza) of a debtor upon a petition filed by the debtor itself, the public prosecutor and/or one or more creditors. Insolvency, as defined under Article 2, letter (b) of the Italian Insolvency Code, is defined as the state of the debtor, manifested by defaults and/or other external elements evidencing that the debtor is no longer able to regularly meet its obligations as they come due. This must be a permanent, and not a temporary status of insolvency, in order for a court to hold that a debtor is insolvent. The Italian Insolvency Code also introduced a specific concept of crisis (crisi), which is defined under Article 2, letter (a) of the Italian Insolvency Code as the state of the debtor such that it is likely that insolvency will follow, which is manifested by the inadequacy of prospective cash flows to meet obligations in the following 12 months. Both insolvency and crisis are factual situations upon the occurrence of which different instruments provided for by the Italian Insolvency Code may be activated. In cases where a debtor is facing financial difficulties or temporary cash shortfall and, in general, a state of crisis/financial distress, it may be possible for it to enter into out-of-court arrangements with its creditors, which may safeguard the existence of the debtor, but which are susceptible of being reviewed by a court in the event of a subsequent insolvency, and possibly challenged as voidable transactions. The following debt restructuring and insolvency alternatives are available under Italian law for companies in a state of crisis and for insolvent debtors and, in certain cases, also to debtors experiencing an economic or financial imbalance such as to make it likely that a state of crisis and/or distress or their insolvency will occur.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Following an extended period of monitoring inflation rates in Turkey, a consensus has been reached on the existence of conditions indicative of hyperinflation. As a result, the accounting standard IAS 29 ""Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies"" has been applied to translate the accounts of the Turkish subsidiaries. In particular, in accordance with this standard, the restatement of the financial statements as a whole requires the application of specific procedures whereby, with reference to the profit or loss, all items are restated by applying the change in the general price level that occurred between the date on which the income and expenses were initially recognised in the financial statements and the balance sheet date. The Group used the consumer price index (“CPI”), considered the most reliable indicator of changes in general price levels, and normally closest to the concept of the general price index required by IAS 29. The Turkish CPI increased by 15% during the first quarter 2024. With regard to the statement of financial position, monetary items have not been restated as they were already stated at the current measuring unit at the end of the reporting period; instead, non-monetary assets and liabilities have been revalued from the date on which the assets and liabilities were initially recognised to the balance sheet date. The contra-entry for the above-mentioned revaluations was recorded in a dedicated line in the income statement called 'Monetary Net Gain (Loss)'. For the purposes of translating both the profit or loss and statement of financial position as restated above into Euro, the spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period was applied for both profit or loss and statement of financial position balances (instead of the average exchange rate for the period for the latter). - □ □ ----- In accordance with IFRS 8, an operating segment is a component of an entity: a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity); b) whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; c) for which separate financial information is available.

The application of these estimates and assumptions affects the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements, comprising the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated statement of cash flows, as well as the disclosures provided. The actual amounts of the financial statement components, for which estimates and assumptions have been used, may differ from those reported, due to the uncertainty of assumptions and the conditions on which estimates are based. In particular, the uncertainty caused by the current economic and financial crisis has led to the need to make difficult assumptions regarding future business performance as reflected in the Business Plan. Set out below is a listing of consolidated financial statement components that, more than others, require grea ter subjectivity, on the part of the Group, in the application of estimates and, for which, a change in the conditions of underlying assumptions used may give rise to significant risk in relation to the determination of adjustments to the carrying amounts of current assets and liabilities that may have a significant impact on the financial statements of the consolidated companies: - Business combinations (IFRS 3) and measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed: the process of allocation of the cost of a transaction to the assets of TeamSystem Group following a business combination is based on estimates and assumptions derived from Management's professional judgement. Professional judgement is also used to determine the most appropriate methodologies for the measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including contingent assets and liabilities) and, in certain cases, provisional initial recognition has been opted for, as permitted by the applicable accounting standard. - Goodwill and other intangible assets: goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life (none of the latter existed as at the reporting date) are tested annually for impairment and during the course of the year, if there is any indication thereof. Other intangible assets are tested annually for impairment when there are indications that the carrying amount may not be recovered. When value in use needs to be computed, the Directors estimate the cash flows expected from an asset or from the Cash Generating Unit a nd choose a discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. Accordingly, the impairment test for fixed assets is performed using forecasts, which are naturally subject to uncertainty, of cash flow included in business plans approved by the relevant Boards of Directors or in projections prepared by management of the Group companies in periods in which the business plan has not been updated for the insights needed to make strategic choices. - Allowance for bad debts: the allowance for bad debts reflects Management's estimate of the losses pertaining to receivables due from end customers and the sales network. The estimate of the allowance for ba d debts is based on losses expected to be incurred by the Group (also considering the requirements of the new IFRS 9), determined based on past experience with similar receivables, on current and historical past due, on losses and payment collection and on careful monitoring of asset quality and forecasts of economic and market conditions. - Provisions for risks and charges: these provisions relate to liabilities that are certain or probable, the amount of which has not been determined at the reporting date, but the cost of which, as required to meet the obligation, can be reliably estimated by Management. They are recognised in the financial statements in the event of an existing legal or implicit obligation resulting from a prior event and it is probable that the Group will be required to meet the obligation. If the impact is significant, the provisions are measured at discounted present value. - Employee benefits: the cost of employee benefit plans is determined using actuarial assessments. An actuarial assessment requires the application of assumptions with respect to discount rates, the expected yield from investments, future wage increases, mortality rates and future increases in pensions. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, the estimates are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty. - Liabilities to non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries: This represents the estimated liability with respect to put and call options or earn-out agreements relating to non-controlling interests in Group companies.

The adoption of these amendments had no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements. - On 22 September 2022, the IASB published an amendment entitled ‘Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback’.

The amendment will apply from 1 January 2025, but earlier application is permitted. The Directors do not expect a material effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this amendment. - On 25 May 2023, the IASB published an amendment entitled ‘Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements’. The document requires an entity to provide additional disclosures about reverse factoring arrangements that enable users of financial statements to evaluate how supplier finance arrangements may affect the entity's liabilities and cash flows and to understand the effect of those arrangements on the entity's exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024, but earlier application is permitted.

Goodwill consists of the excess of the consideration paid by the shareholders over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The increase in goodwill of € 26,285 thousand, occurred in the first three months of 2024, is due to the acquisitions as described in the following paragraph “Allocation of provisional Goodwill” while “Other movements” are mainly attributable to the change in exchange rates adopted for the preparation of financial statements and to reclassification of part of Goodwill from the Market Specific Solutions CGU to the Cross Segment Products CGU, as described below. During the first three months of 2024, the Group implemented a minor change regarding the operating segments, moving the “Trust solution products” from “Market Specific Solution” business to “HR” business unit. The new business unit resulting from this re-organization has been called “Cross-Segment Products”. As a result of this organizational change, the Group has consistently reclassified the relevant part of Goodwill from the Market Specific Solutions (“MSS”) CGU to the Cross Segment Products (“CSP”) CGU. The Directors believe that this change did not lead to the emergence of indicators of potential losses, in consideration of quantitative and qualitative aspects, including the non-materiality of the amounts subject to reclassification and the significant headrooms at 31 December 2023 for both CGUs, as resulting from the impairment tests carried out as of 31 December 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Finally, it should be noted that the TeamSystem Group, as from September 2023, owns the Mikro Group which operates in Turkey, a country currently characterised by hyperinflation and significant fluctuations in exchange rates.

The maximum theoretical exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the carrying amount of trade receivables as presented in the consolidated financial statements, as well as residual financial receivables recorded in current and non-current financial assets. The tool used by the Group for the classification and control of trade receivables consists of an Ageing List, in which amounts of overdue receivables are summarised by ageing category, from the most recent (0-30 days) to the oldest (over 180 days). The amount of the allowance for bad debts at 31 March 2024 was determined by adopting an expected credit loss approach (as required by the relevant IFRS 9), taking into account both past due receivables, the allowance for which was determined based on a specific analysis of doubtful accounts and receivables that are not yet past due at the reporting date, therefore estimating a generic write-down based on historical data and the past credit loss experience of the Group, adjusted to take into account expected losses from specific debtors and the macroeconomic environment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Changes in fair value, due both to timing and possible changes in estimated indicators that form the basis for the computation of the consideration, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss; the impact recognised in the 2023 consolidated statement of profit or loss arising from the change in the fair value measurement of the liabilities to non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries amounts to a decrease in their measurement of approximately € 13,730 thousand and an increase in their measurement of approximately € 13,016 thousand whereas € 11,964 thousand was recognised as finance costs for the discounting of the liability to noncontrolling shareholders of subsidiaries at the new rate for the period in the item Other IFRS financial charges (see Note 7 Finance Income and Finance Costs and Note 18 Net Cash/Debt).

Changes in fair value, due both to timing and possible changes in estimated indicators that form the basis for the computation of the consideration, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit or loss; the impact recognised in the 2022 consolidated statement of profit or loss arising from the change in the fair va lue measurement of the liabilities to non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries amounts to a decrease in their measurement of approximately € 12,603 thousand and an increase in their measurement of a pproximately € 34.016, whereas € 2,762 thousand was recognised as finance costs for the discounting of the lia bility to noncontrolling shareholders of subsidiaries at the new rate for the period in the item Other IFRS financial charges (see Note 7 Finance Income, Note 8 Finance Costs and Note 18 Net Cash/Debt).

The MPEEM is based on the principle that, since the target company's current income must be allocated in full to the assets identified when allocating the acquisition price, the income pertaining to the strategic (or dominant) asset can be derived by difference by deducting the normal remuneration of all other assets (tangible, intangible and working capital) from the total income. The MPEEM is therefore based on a stratification principle that conceives corporate income as the sum of the normal income that each asset contributes to generate. A necessary and most critical step in the application of MPEEM is the identification of the Contributory Assets that support the dominant strategic asset in generating profit. The most common Contributory Assets are net working capital, property, plant and equipment, other intangibles identified separately from goodwill, and intangibles that are not separable from goodwill but still constitute Contributory Assets (e.g. workforce). The main parameters considered by the Group for the purposes of applying the MPEEM are: revenues, growth rate (""g-rate""), Churn rate, Ebitda margin, Discount rate (WACC + Spread). The amortisation process is distributed over the useful life of the asset, estimated between a maximum of thirteen years and a minimum of eight years. Customer relationship represents the sum total of contractual (supply contracts and service contracts etc.) and noncontractual customer relationships and has been valued based on discounted income flows (Income Approach). Amortisation is recognised over the useful life of the asset, which is estimated to be between a maximum of twelve years (TeamSystem S.p.A.) and a minimum of eight years (other TeamSystem Group companies).",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

The RFR method takes the form of discounting the royalty flows that the market would be willing to pay to the owner of the software in order to license the right to use it. In the absence of precise contractual references, these flows are calculated by applying a royalty rate to the turnover that the company owning the software believes it will realise in a period of time that is considered congruous. The royalty rate is derived from an analysis of market transactions involving comparable assets. In applying this method, any synergies assumed by a third party should be disregarded. The value of the asset is represented by the sum of the present values of the income flows determined as described above. The main parameters considered by the Group for the application of the RFR are: revenues, royalty rate, useful life, discount rate (WACC + Spread). These intangible software assets are amortised over their estimated useful life of five years.

Specifically, debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured subsequently at amortised cost. Despite the foregoing, the Group may make the following irrevocable election/designation at initial recognition of a financial asset: - The Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination in other comprehensive income; and - The Group may irrevocably designate a debt instrument that meets the amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) criteria as measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. In the current year, the Group has not designated any investments in debt instruments that meet the amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria as measured at FVTPL. When an investment in a debt instrument measured at FVTOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. On the other hand, when an equity investment designated as measured at FVTOCI is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is subsequently transferred to retained earnings without going through profit or loss. Debt instruments that are measured subsequently at amortised cost or at FVTOCI are subject to impairment. See (3) below. The main financial assets held by the Group consist of trade receivables, the business model classification of which has not given rise to any changes in measurement. For this class of assets, changes arose, however, in the measurement of impairment. 2) Classification and measurement of financial liabilities An entity recognises a financial liability when it has contractual obligations to make a payment. It is therefore necessary to measure these contractual obligations at initial recognition. All financial liabilities must initially be recognised at fair value, less (in the case of a financial liability that is not at FVTPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the financial liability. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for Liabilities to non-controlling shareholders of subsidiaries, which are measured at FVTPL. 3) Impairment of financial assets In relation to the impairment of financial assets, the Group applies a model based on expected credit losses. The expected credit loss model requires the Group to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the financial assets. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognised. In relation to trade receivables and assets arising from contracts with customers, the Group applies the simplified approach indicated by IFRS 9 for the measurement of the lifetime expected loss allowance. The Group computes the amount of expected credit losses in relation to these elements through the use of a provision matrix, estimated based on historical loss rates applied to outstanding trade receivable balances, adjusted to reflect current conditions and estimates of future economic conditions. Accordingly, the credit risk profile of these assets is presented according to the past due ranges based on the provision matrix. ----- 4) Accounting for hedging transactions. All derivative instruments be measured at fair value both at initial recognition and at the end of each subsequent reporting period. If the fair value measurement is positive, the derivative financial instrument is recognised as a financial asset in the statement of financial position; if the fair value measurement is negative, the derivative represents a financial liability and is classified as a liability in the statement of financial position. The balancing entry for the subsequent measurement of the derivative is generally the statement of profit or loss; for hedging instruments, however, there is the option of representing the hedged item and the hedging instrument directly in the appropriate reserve in the statement of comprehensive income (hedge accounting). Under IFRS 9, a hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting only if all of the following criteria are met: a) the hedging relationship consists only of hedging instruments and hedged items that meet the requirements of IFRS 9; b) at the inception of the hedging relationship there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge; c) the hedging relationship meets all the hedge effectiveness requirements of IFRS 9. The Group uses derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes in order to manage its exposure to risk arising from changes in interest rates. Despite such derivative financial instruments having been entered into solely for hedging purposes and that they could potentially qualify as cash flow hedges, the Group has decided not to exercise the option, provided for by IFRS 9, to use hedge accounting for the recognition of such instruments and, accordingly, recognises changes in fair value of these derivative financial in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

Under IFRS 9, a hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting only if all of the following criteria are met: a) the hedging relationship consists only of hedging instruments and hedged items that meet the requirements of IFRS 9. b) at the inception of the hedging relationship there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. c) the hedging relationship meets all the hedge effectiveness requirements of IFRS 9. The Group uses derivative financial instruments for economic hedging purposes in order to manage its exposure to risk arising from changes in interest rates. Despite such derivative financial instruments having been entered into solely for hedging purposes and that they could potentially qualify as cash flow hedges, the Group has decided not to exercise the option, provided for by IFRS 9, to use hedge accounting for the recognition of such instruments and, accordingly, recognises changes in fair value of these derivative financial in profit or loss. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,651

CGUs have been identified consistently with the management's vision both at the level of monitoring results and at the level of economic-financial planning Goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs identified above is tested for impairment at least annually. Regarding the impairment test conducted as of 31 December 2023, steps have been taken to determine the recoverable amount (enterprise value) of each CGU of TeamSystem Group as a whole that had been identified by Management as the lowest level to which goodwill is allocated for internal management purposes, by means of the application of discounted cash flow methodology. The test was performed by discounting prospective cash flows for 2024-2027 based on amounts included in the 2023-2027 Group Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of TeamSystem Holding S.p.A on 20 March 2023 and updated only for the year 2024 with the 2024 budget. A terminal value was determined beyond the explicit forecast horizon based on operating cash flows (net operating profit less adjusted taxes - NOPLAT) appropriately normalised to reflect normal business operations. In the choice of the growth rate to apply to NOPLAT, it was established that, consistent with the growth envisaged in the Business Plan and with historical growth rates, there was a reasonable expectation of growth of 2.0% (“g rate”). In addition to the assumed g rate, the main assumptions adopted regarded an estimate of the post-tax weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) of 9.2% (Enterprise CGU, Professional CGU, Market Specific Solutions CGU, and HR CGU), 9.8% (Digital Finance CGU) and 9.7% (Micro CGU).

The test was performed by discounting prospective cash flows for 2023-2027 based on a mounts included in the Group Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of TeamSystem S.p.A on 20 March 2023.

The impairment tests performed required a writedown of € 78 million recorded in line item Impairment of non current assets of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022, which was entirely related to the Digital Finance CGU; The impairment loss recognised arose initially from the higher interest rates seen in 2022, which were used to perform the test as at 31 December 2022. These rates were higher than in the previous year and were consistent with the trends in the financial markets. In some cases, this circumstance reduced the cover a ttributed to the Group's various CGUs compared to the previous year's figures, with a major effect for the Digital Fina nce CGU, which had already appeared in the sensitivity analysis performed on the financial statements at 31 December 2021. The new plans approved by the Directors, while still anticipating significant growth for the Digital Fina nce CGU which is expected to expand, have introduced some prudent adjustments to reflect the uncertainty in the markets and the characteristics of the CGU's core business, which is still relatively new for the TeamSystem Group.

IAS 19 - Employee Benefits requires the recognition of actuarial gains and losses arising from the “remeasurement” of liabilities and assets in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The maximum theoretical exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the carrying amount of trade receivables as presented in the consolidated financial statements, as well as residual financial receivables recorded in current and non-current financial assets.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of TeamSystem Holdco S.p.A. in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; ----- 3 ###### obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of TeamSystem HoldCo S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (“TeamSystem Group” or “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at December 31, 2022, the consolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of TeamSystem HoldCo S.p.A. in accordance with the ethical requirements applicable under Italian law to the audit of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Responsibilities of the Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

The Board of Statutory Auditors is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Directors; conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; ----- 3 ###### obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
