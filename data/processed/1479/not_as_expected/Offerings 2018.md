**Notice to certain European investors**

**European Economic Area**

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all
channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any
person subsequently offering, selling, or recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold, or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold, or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes,
a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance
Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

Belgium and may not be considered as being an offer of securities made to the public in Belgium by any initial

instruments and the admission of investment instruments to trading on a regulated market or (ii) to any persons
qualifying as a consumer within the meaning of Book VI of the Belgian Economic Law Code. The Notes offered

**Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements**

This offering memorandum includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives,
assumptions, or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be,
“forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,”
“projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or
comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They
appear in a number of places throughout this offering memorandum and include statements regarding our
intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial
condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market in which we operate, and development
of the industry in which we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and
depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk factors” section of this offering memorandum. Those
factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this
offering memorandum.

Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made,
we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the markets in which
we operate, and the development of the industries in which we operate, may differ materially from those
described in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition,
even if our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the
markets in which we operate, and the development of the industries in which we operate are consistent with the
forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be
indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering memorandum speak only as of the date
of those statements, and we undertake no obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the
results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of
results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future
performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

**Use of non-IFRS financial measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain non-IFRS measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, and similar measures, which are not required by, or presented in accordance with,
IFRS. As used in this offering memorandum, the following terms have the following meanings:

   - “EBITDA” means profit for the period before financing income and expenses, income taxes,
depreciation, and amortization.

   - “Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA adjusted to (i) eliminate certain non-operating income or expense
items, (ii) eliminate the impact of certain non-cash and other items that are included in profit for the
period and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and
(iii) eliminate certain unusual items impacting results in a particular period. See “Summary—Summary
_historical combined carve-out and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data.”_

   - “Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA, further adjusted to reflect the pro forma
effect of the Transactions, the impact from the future adoption of IFRS 16 “Leases” requiring the
treatment of nearly all operating lease obligations as capital lease obligations and as debt for certain
purposes under the Indenture, the elimination of fees paid to our Sponsors, and cost savings expected to
be achieved within 24 months of completion of the Transactions. See “Summary—Summary historical
_combined carve-out and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data.”_

We believe that EBITDA is a useful indicator of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist
certain investors, security analysts, and other interested parties in evaluating us. We believe that Adjusted
EBITDA is a relevant measure for assessing our performance because it is adjusted for certain items which, we
believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance and thus aids in an understanding of EBITDA.
We believe that Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is a relevant measure for assessing our performance because it
reflects the adjustment for certain items related to cost saving initiatives we expect to implement after the
Transactions and the future adoption of IFRS 16 “Leases”. With respect to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, we
have (i) given effect to the application of IFRS 16 “Leases” because we are required to adopt this standard
effective January 1, 2019, and it is consistent with the treatment of operating leases under our senior secured
credit facilities and under the Indenture, (ii) eliminated fees paid to our Sponsors, and (iii) given effect to
anticipated cost savings expected to be achieved within 24 months of the completion of the Transactions.

The non-IFRS metrics in this offering memorandum are used by different companies for differing purposes and
are often calculated in ways that reflect the particular circumstances of those companies. You should exercise
caution in comparing the non-IFRS metrics reported by us to such metrics or other similar metrics as reported by
other companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as presented here differ from
the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” expected to be contained in the Indenture. None of our non-IFRS
metrics is a measurement of performance under IFRS, and you should not consider those measures as an
alternative to profit for the period determined in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS metrics do not necessarily
indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to meet our cash requirement and may not be indicative
of our historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future results. Our
non-IFRS metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of
these limitations are:

   - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

   - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

   - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debts;

ix


-----

   - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

   - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and

   - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures.

Additionally, we present the following non-IFRS measures in this offering memorandum, which we believe will
be useful to investors: Adjusted EBITDA margin, maintenance capital expenditures, Free Cash Flow, cash
conversion, pro forma cash interest expense, ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest
expense, ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures to pro forma cash interest
expense, pro forma total secured debt, pro forma total debt, pro forma senior secured net debt, pro forma total net
debt, ratio of pro forma senior secured net debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, ratio of pro forma total net debt
to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, revenue variance on a constant currency basis, and contribution margin.

**Financial information**

The combined carve-out financial statements of the Specialty Chemicals business as of December 31, 2015,
2016, and 2017 and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (the “Annual Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements”) and the unaudited interim condensed combined financial statements as of June 30, 2018
and for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, the “Interim Condensed Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements” and, together with the Annual Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, the “Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements”, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, have been derived from the
accounting books that were used when preparing the financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. The Annual
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The unaudited Interim
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements as of June 30, 2018 and for the six-month periods ended June 30,
2017 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the standard adopted by the European Union
applicable to interim financial reporting. The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Starfruit Finco B.V.
as of June 30, 2018 and for the period from March 19, 2018 (inception) to June 30, 2018, together with the notes
thereto, are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The Specialty Chemicals business historically did not exist as a separate legal and reporting group but functioned
as part of the larger group of companies controlled by Akzo Nobel N.V. Accordingly, the financial information
included in this offering memorandum has been prepared on a carve-out basis whereby the assets and liabilities
in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been reflected on a historical cost basis, as included in the
historical consolidated balance sheets of Akzo Nobel N.V. Further, the combined statements of income include
allocations for certain corporate overhead services performed by Akzo Nobel N.V., including but not limited to,
executive oversight, information management, legal, treasury, pensions, control and accounting, human
resources, taxes, and investor relations. These expenses have been allocated to the Specialty Chemicals business
on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on allocation drivers
management of Akzo Nobel N.V. believes to be reasonable. Accordingly, the historical financial information in
this offering memorandum may not reflect what our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows would
have been had we been a standalone company during the periods presented and may not be indicative of what our
results of operations, financial position, or cash flows will be in the future. As a result, you will have limited
information on which to evaluate our business and to make your investment decision. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to the Acquisition—We have not operated as a standalone company before, and the historical and pro_
_forma financial information presented in this offering memorandum is not necessarily representative of the_
_results that we would have achieved as a standalone company and may not be indicative of future results.”_

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Dutch Co-Issuer presented in this
offering memorandum has been derived by the application of pro forma adjustments to the historical combined
financial statements of the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Specialty Chemicals business included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum. These pro forma adjustments give effect to the Transactions as described in “The
_Transactions,” including the completion of this offering, as if all such Transactions had occurred on January 1,_
2017, in the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statements, and as of June 30, 2018, in
the case of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. See “Unaudited pro forma condensed
_combined financial information” for a complete description of the adjustments and assumptions underlying the_
pro forma condensed combined financial information included in this offering memorandum.

We track intercompany sales of a product line within such product line’s product family and to other product
families. We also track intercompany sales of a product family to other product families. In this offering
memorandum, (a) when we present sales of a product line as a percentage of such product line’s product family
revenue or our total revenue, such percentage includes the intercompany sales of such product line within such
product line’s product family and to other product families and (b) when we present sales of a product family as a
percentage of our total revenue, such percentage includes the intercompany sales of such product family to other
product families. However, when we present sales of a particular product family into a particular geography, such
sales exclude intercompany sales.

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of our company, the terms of this
offering, and the financial and other information included herein.

**Market and other data**

Throughout this offering memorandum, we refer to our market position and market share in various markets and
regions, the size of certain markets, and anticipated growth rates of the markets for our products. These
statements are generally based on publicly available independent market research reports published by Nexant,
Inc., a consultant offering energy and chemicals advisory services, which speaks as of December 31, 2016 (the
“Nexant Reports”) and/or estimates of our management, which estimates are in turn based on, and informed by,
our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate, reports by market research
firms, including the Nexant Reports, as well as information obtained from surveys, customers, distributors,
suppliers, trade and business organizations, and/or other contacts in the markets in which we operate.

By their nature, many of these statements, including those with respect to anticipated growth rates of the markets
for our products, are forward-looking statements that inherently involve risks and uncertainties because they
relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. See “Cautionary statement
_regarding forward-looking statements.”_

There are no precise definitions for our markets. We have presented our markets in this offering memorandum in
a manner that is consistent with the way our management views, organizes and operates our business. However,
third-party reports may define our markets differently and our competitors may do the same.

We confirm that the information in this offering memorandum that is based on statistical information from the
Nexant Reports has been accurately reproduced and that, so far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from
information published by publicly available sources and other publications, no facts have been omitted which
would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Industry publications, reports and other
published data generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to
be reliable, but we cannot assure you that the information contained in the Nexant Reports, and therefore the
information contained in this offering memorandum that is derived therefrom, is accurate or complete. The
information in the Nexant Reports may prove to be inaccurate because information cannot always be verified
with complete certainty due to the limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the

xi


-----

data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties. Moreover, the information in the Nexant Reports
is generally in respect of the year ended December 31, 2016 and therefore the information derived therefrom
included in this offering memorandum is based on information from the year ended December 31, 2016. While
we believe such information remains accurate, there can be no certainty that there have not been changes in the
markets described therein in light of the passage of time. As a result, although we believe the Nexant Reports are
reliable and we are not aware of any misstatements regarding the data included herein derived therefrom, neither
we nor the initial purchasers have independently verified such information and cannot guarantee its accuracy and
completeness.

**Enforceability of civil liabilities against foreign persons**

The Dutch Co-Issuer is a Dutch entity, the Swedish Co-Issuer is a Swedish entity and many of the guarantors of
the Notes are organized outside of the United States. In addition, our and certain of our guarantors’ officers and
directors are, and will continue to be, non-residents of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for
you to effect service of process within the United States on us, our non-U.S. guarantors or our and their
respective officers and directors. Furthermore, it may not be possible for you to enforce against us or them
judgments obtained in U.S. courts because most of our assets are located outside the United States. For more
information, see “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer” and
“Service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities.”

We own or have rights to trademarks, service marks, or trade names that we use in connection with the operation

**Our company**

We are a leading global specialty chemicals manufacturer that provides essential chemistries for a diverse
portfolio of products, end-markets, customers, and geographies. We hold the #1 or #2 leadership position in
product lines that represent over 80% of our revenues. Our products are mission critical building blocks for
applications that serve diverse end-markets, including agriculture, cleaning, construction, food, fuels, oil and gas,
personal care, pharmaceuticals, plastic applications in automotive, and pulp and packaging. We expect our
end-markets to benefit from favorable long-term secular trends including agriculture intensification, automotive
light-weighting, energy efficiency in buildings, and demand for environmentally friendly products. We are
headquartered in the Netherlands, with sales in over 130 countries and key offices in Chicago, the Gothenburg
area (Sweden), and Shanghai. We have a 400-year history and function as a largely independent company within
AkzoNobel.

Our business is highly diversified, manufacturing approximately 10,000 discrete products across 21 different
product lines under the umbrella of five product families: Industrial Chemicals (“IC”), Surface Chemistry
(“SC”), Pulp and Performance Chemicals (“PPC”), Polymer Chemistry (“PC”), and Ethylene and Sulfur
Derivatives (“ESD”). Each product family holds leadership positions in key product lines and has a strong
presence across the geographic regions in which it operates. Our products are sold in well-structured markets
where incumbents have sustainable competitive advantages, including transportation limitations and the need for
specialized know-how given production and product handling complexity. Our stable cost structure and margins
are in large part due to favorable raw material pass-through dynamics. We also bolster our reliability of supply
through various points of integration within and across product families. For example, in our IC product family,
we are significantly backward integrated across the value chain, and our ESD product family supplies a key
feedstock to our SC product family. Additionally, central functional groups support each product family,
allowing for shared best practices across the portfolio.

**Our business strategies**

**_Leverage existing product portfolio and global footprint to expand market share and capitalize on growth_**
**_trends_**

We intend to leverage our leadership positions in attractive applications and geographies to expand our market
share and capture new high margin opportunities. For example, in our IC product family, we expect to gain
market share as a result of targeted investments to grow with contracted customer demand, such as the addition
of chlor-alkali capacity at our facility in Rotterdam and the expansion of our salt production capacity in Delfzijl,
the Netherlands. In our SC product family, our focus on higher value products, as well as our strong innovation
pipeline, is expected to help us drive growth with new and existing customers. In our PPC product family, we are
the largest sodium chlorate producer in the Brazilian market, which is one of the fastest growing pulp markets
globally, and we are well positioned to capture the region’s superior growth potential. In our PC product family,
our organic peroxides manufacturing footprint has positioned us to capture higher growth in China and North
America, as well as in niche applications such as HPMO. Finally, in our ESD product family, we are focused on
our biodegradable and micronutrient product offerings, allowing us to capture share in the growing automatic
dishwashing detergent and fertigation markets.

**_Continue to pursue innovation and leverage our customer and end-market expertise as key growth drivers_**

Our ability to innovate has not only contributed to growth in the last several years, but will also enable us to
further grow share with both new and existing customers. We believe that our focus on innovation will enable us
to outpace overall market growth. Our RD&I organization and facilities are best-in-class, with employees
dedicated to individual product families, and in some cases working alongside our customers. As a result, we are
able to leverage know-how, assets, and infrastructure across our product families, as well as share knowledge and
expertise regarding end-markets and customers’ needs. In addition, we seek outside opportunities to further our
innovation pipeline, including through collaboration and innovation with universities and start-ups. We intend to
leverage our close customer relationships and RD&I collaboration to react quickly to changing market dynamics
and to better serve and tailor solutions for our customers.

Our focus on new products and application development has enabled us to increase our share of revenue derived
from recently introduced products from 8% in 2013 to 12% in 2017. Compared to the rest of the portfolio, these
sales generally capture higher margins and higher growth, and we expect to maintain or grow our current pace of
innovation going forward. Innovation, customer intimacy, and end-market expertise have been important
components of our historical success and as we enter a new chapter in our history with Carlyle as our partner, we
intend to continue our commitment to these principles, positioning us well to meet the needs of our customers
and achieve growth.

**_Realize operational and commercial improvement opportunities as a standalone company_**

As a standalone company, and in connection with our new ownership, we plan to expand and accelerate a number
of cost-saving initiatives already underway, as well as focus on additional commercial improvement
opportunities. We intend to enhance our business processes, including further centralizing procurement activities,
improving manufacturing productivity, and reducing maintenance expense through predictive rather than reactive
maintenance. We expect to realize approximately €51 million of these cash cost savings within 24 months of the
Closing Date.

We also believe that there is potential to realize additional material benefits from commercial excellence
initiatives. We believe we can improve sales force efficiency by reviewing the key account management
infrastructure, re-evaluating and improving sales incentives mechanisms, reviewing pricing processes and
governance, and deploying tools to provide support to our sales teams. We expect that such initiatives will
increase both revenue and margins.

**_Emphasize free cash flow generation to facilitate deleveraging_**

One of our primary goals is to generate cash flow to facilitate deleveraging. To achieve this goal, we will place
significant management emphasis on cash generation, efficient capital spending, and working capital
management, including linking a portion of management’s compensation to cash flow generation. Historically,
we have been able to generate strong cash flow while meeting the capital requirements of our business, and we
believe we are well positioned to continue improving free cash flow. In the past few years, we have made
significant investments focused on technology efficiency and capacity growth. This has resulted in a wellinvested asset base with lower on-going capital requirements. Our separation from AkzoNobel will provide us
with more flexibility for efficient capital allocation and is expected to enable our management to further drive the
business to reach its potential as a standalone company.

**Our product families**

**_Industrial Chemicals (IC)_**

_Business Overview_

Our Industrial Chemicals product family is a leading producer and supplier across the energy-salt-chlorine value
chain. We produce (i) chlorine and caustic soda (together referred to as chlor-alkali) used as inputs into products
serving end-markets and applications including construction (PVC, coatings), textiles, paper, packaging, resins,
detergents, and oil and gas; (ii) industrial salt used in the production of chlor-alkali, de-icing products, and salt
specialties, with exposure to agriculture, food, and pharmaceuticals; and (iii) chlorine derivatives, such as MCA
and chloromethanes, used in agriculture, food thickeners, cosmetics, hair styling, and pharmaceuticals. In the
LTM Period, our IC product family generated €1,340 million of revenue, or 26% of total revenue.


11

-----

Industrial Chemicals operates nine manufacturing facilities and six joint ventures: 11 in Europe, three in Asia,
and one in North America. In addition, IC utilizes our multi-product-family RD&I site in Deventer, the
Netherlands. As of December 31, 2017, IC had approximately 1,800 employees.

_Industry and End-Markets_

Our Industrial Chemicals product family has an estimated aggregate addressable market size of approximately
€8.0 billion. Our key addressable markets include the chlor-alkali market in Western Europe, which has an
estimated market size of approximately €5 billion and the industrial salt market in Western Europe, which is
estimated to have a market size of approximately €800 million. The chlor-alkali industry is regional due to strict
regulations and safety requirements related to the transportation of chlorine. We hold the #1 market share of
merchant chlorine in Western Europe and the #2 market share of merchant caustic soda in Western Europe.

Our Industrial Chemicals product family benefits from a number of sustainable competitive advantages,
including IP related to complex technological processes, reliable access to attractively priced raw materials and
utilities, capital intensity significant expertise required to handle hazardous chemicals, and high switching costs
for customers due to integrated infrastructure. These characteristics have historically driven a high degree at
consolidation in our industry. For example, in chlorine, the top five producers collectively account for
approximately 67% of capacity in Western Europe (including non-merchant capacity), and in MCA, the top three
producers collectively account for approximately 68% of capacity globally.

The market for our products in the IC product family is expected to experience stable growth going forward. The
chlor-alkali market in Western Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.0% from 2016 through
2022. We sell chlor-alkali into a wide range of end-markets with various industrial and chemical uses; therefore,
we expect demand for our chlor-alkali to remain largely insulated from any single end-market and to grow in line
with global GDP. Chlorine is a significant input into PVC and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”), with
both largely used in construction end-markets. However, MDI is used in faster growing applications, including
energy efficient insulation, and its demand is expected to grow faster than PVC demand as a result of legislation
mandating improvements in the energy efficiency of buildings. A greater portion of our chlorine is used in the
production of MDI as compared to the rest of the market as a result of our customer mix.

There are three main chlor-alkali production technologies: membrane, diaphragm, and mercury cell. Due to
environmental concerns and poor economics, the capacity utilizing the diaphragm and mercury cell technologies
is declining, and as a result, overall capacity for chlor-alkali production has tightened in the last several years. In
addition, stringent regulations required the complete phase-out of mercury-based production by the end of 2017
in the European Union. Our competitors collectively retired approximately 7% of installed chlor-alkali capacity
in Western Europe in response to these regulatory changes. We have been the industry leader in the conversion,
and all of our mercury chlor-alkali facilities have been converted to membrane technology.

The shift to the membrane process is also expected to have important impacts on the industrial salt industry. The
Western European industrial salt market is estimated to be approximately €800 million and largely serves
electrolysis-based chemical transformation applications, particularly chlor-alkali production using the membrane
process. Other key applications are non-electrolysis chemical transformation, de-icing, and specialties (used in
water treatment or food processing). Different salt grades and salt sources exist, with electrolysis applications
requiring higher salt purity levels. The salt market is largely regional, given high relative transportation costs.
Demand for most applications has historically been characterized by stability and predictability. Overall, the
industrial salt market in Western Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 1.1% from 2016
through 2022 (excluding de-icing to which we have minimal exposure).

Conversion to the membrane process for chlor-alkali, which requires higher purity salt than the mercury process
it replaces, is expected to increase demand for higher salt grades, creating a need for capacity expansion. We

formulation expertise, and joint product development initiatives, with our top three customers having an average
relationship length of 25 years.

Surface Chemistry operates 13 manufacturing facilities: six in North America, three in Europe, three in Asia and
one in South America and four major RD&I sites in Brewster, New York; Bridgewater, New Jersey;
Stenungsund, Sweden; and Songjiang, China. As of December 31, 2017, SC had approximately 1,600 employees.

_Industry and End-Markets_

The global surfactant and personal care polymer market has an estimated aggregate market size of €34 billion.
We focus on the approximately €12 billion specialty surfactant market within the broader €29 billion global
surfactant market, and the approximately €1 billion hairstyling market within the broader €5 billion personal care
polymer solutions market.

Specialty surfactants are utilized in end-markets and applications such as agriculture, asphalt, mining, oilfield,
organoclay, cleaning, intermediates, fuels and lubes, fabric softener, and water treatment. Speciality surfacants
are often unique formulations tailored to provide specific functionality depending on a customer’s requirements,
yielding higher margins than non-specialized surfactants. Our Surface Chemistry product family benefits from a
number of sustainable competitive advantages, including (i) IP related to complex technology and processes,
surface applications, and regulatory know-how, (ii) high level of customer intimacy given co-development of
formulations, and (iii) customers’ need for global, reliable supply supported by a strategic manufacturing
footprint. As a result, the competitive landscape has been stable over time with limited large capacity additions
expected in future years.

The global specialty surfactant market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2016 through 2022, driven
by surfactant demand growth in the oilfield, agrochemicals, and fuels and lubes end-markets, with CAGRs of
4.6%, 3.7%, and 5.0% from 2016 through 2022, respectively. Our personal care polymers primarily serve the
market for hair styling agents, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 1.3%, over the same period.

**_Pulp and Performance Chemicals (PPC)_**

_Business Overview_

Our Pulp and Performance Chemicals product family is a leading supplier of bleaching chemicals and silicabased performance chemicals. Bleaching chemicals consist of sodium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide, both
primarily used to bleach pulp. Performance chemicals consist of highly specialized chemical products including
expandable microspheres, colloidal silica, and separation products. Our bleaching chemicals are primarily used in
pulp and packaging, and following the disposal of our paper chemicals business in 2015, we have significantly
reduced our exposure to the declining printing and writing paper market. Our performance chemicals serve more

On March 27, 2018, the Dutch Co-Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Seller, pursuant to
which the Dutch Co-Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will, directly or indirectly, acquire, through one or more
separate acquisitions, all of the equity interests of the Specialty Chemicals Entities.

The Acquisition Agreement provides that the total consideration to be paid for Specialty Chemicals Entities will
be €9,860 before certain purchase price adjustments, which will be determined pursuant to the Acquisition
Agreement. For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
_proceeds.”_

The purchase price will be financed through:

   - €3,380 million in cash, which will be contributed to us as common equity by the Sponsors;

   - our borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities; and

   - the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby.

The Specialty Chemicals business may make certain dividends and distributions to the Seller prior to the Closing
Date in connection with the Transactions, which could be material.

The Acquisition Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants with respect to the
conduct of the Specialty Chemicals Entities prior to the Closing Date and various closing conditions. In addition,
the Seller has agreed to take certain actions to facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis, including,
subject to certain exceptions, providing, among others, the following Transitional Services: (i) the operation,

All notifications and filings with the relevant governmental authorities required to be made under the Acquisition
Agreement in connection with Acquisition have been made and the relevant approvals, consents or clearances in
connection therewith have been received as of the date hereof. Notice has been delivered to the Seller that such
approvals, consents and/or clearances have been received and the related condition to closing under the
Acquisition Agreement has been satisfied.

Further, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Seller has agreed that, for the three-year period following
the Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries will undertake in any capacity any research and development,
production, marketing, sale, or distribution of specialty chemicals worldwide, as carried on immediately prior to
January 1, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) solely by the Specialty Chemicals Entities (or as contemplated,
immediately prior to the Effective Date, solely by the Specialty Chemicals Entities, to be carried on by the
Specialty Chemicals Entities) or any activity which is of the same or similar type thereto and which is or is likely
to be in competition therewith. Similarly, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Dutch Co-Issuer has
agreed that, for the three-year period following the Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries will undertake in
any capacity any research and development, production, marketing, sale, or distribution of paints and coatings
worldwide, as carried on immediately prior to the Effective Date (or contemplated, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, to be carried on) by Seller and its affiliates, excluding any activity carried on immediately prior to
the Effective Date (or contemplated, immediately prior to the Effective Date, to be carried on) by the Specialty
Chemicals Entities or any activity which is of the same or similar type thereto and which is or is likely to be in
competition therewith. The Seller has also agreed that, for a one-year period following the Closing Date, it shall
not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not knowingly solicit for employment certain employees of the Specialty
Chemicals Entities, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Dutch Co-Issuer has also agreed that, for a

one-year period following the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not knowingly solicit
for employment certain employees of the Seller and its affiliates, subject to certain customary exceptions.

This offering may close prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the initial purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds from the sale
of each series of Notes into escrow accounts pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered into by the Issuers,
the Trustee and an escrow agent with customary size and capability for transactions of similar size and
complexity to the offering of the Notes, as escrow agent (in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”). The release of
the escrow proceeds will be subject only to the substantially simultaneous closing of the Acquisition . If the
Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside Date or the Issuers notify the Escrow Agent in writing that the
Acquisition Agreement has terminated prior to the Outside Date, each series of Notes will be subject to a special
mandatory redemption, at a price equal to (x) with respect to the Dollar Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of
the Dollar Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date, to, but not including, the date of such
special mandatory redemption and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the Euro
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date, to, but not including, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. Each series of Notes may also be redeemed at our option, in whole but not in part, at any
time prior to the Outside Date, if, in our reasonable judgment, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the
Outside Date, at a redemption price equal to (x) with respect to the Dollar Notes, 100% of the initial issue price
of the Dollar Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date, to, but not including, the special
mandatory redemption date and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the Euro
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date, to, but not including, the special mandatory
redemption date. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of each series of Notes, together with
any earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid
interest on each series of Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. An affiliate
of Carlyle will issue an irrevocable equity commitment letter to the Dutch Co-Issuer, for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Dutch Co-Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment
of accrued and unpaid interest on each series of Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus
certain fees and expenses. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and our indebtedness—In the event that
_the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the Dutch Co-Issuer notifies the Escrow_
_Agent that the Acquisition Agreement has terminated prior to the Outside Date, the Notes will be subject to a_
_special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._

guarantees will be unsecured.

date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with this offering), the
Notes, and the guarantees of such Notes will be the Issuers’ and the
guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and will:

                      - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually
senior in right of payment to all of the Issuers’ and the guarantors’
future subordinated indebtedness;

                       - rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuers’ and the
guarantors’ existing and future senior indebtedness;

obligations, €263 million of operating lease obligations that we are
treating as capital lease obligations and debt for certain purposes
under the Indenture, and including €5,115 million of senior secured
term loans under our new senior secured credit facilities, to which
the Notes would have been effectively subordinated to the extent of
the value of the assets securing such debt;

- the Issuers would have had an additional €750 million of
borrowing capacity under our new revolving credit facility (without
giving effect to a de minimis amount of outstanding letters of credit
expected to be issued under our new revolving credit facility) to
which the Notes would have been effectively subordinated, if
borrowed, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
debt;

- the Issuers would have had the option to increase our new term
loan facilities and/or our new revolving credit facility or raise
additional term loan facilities or revolving credit facility
commitments by an amount not to exceed the sum of (x) the greater

adjustment events and calculated as if any increase in revolving
credit facility commitments or any incremental revolving credit
facility were fully drawn on the effective date thereof but without
giving effect to the cash proceeds of such incremental facility then
being incurred), (a) for any such debt that is secured by the
collateral on a pari passu basis with our new senior secured credit
facilities, the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, in each case
on a pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if
any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection
with a permitted investment, the consolidated first lien net leverage
ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt; (b) for any
such debt that is secured by the collateral on a junior basis to our
new senior secured credit facilities, the consolidated senior secured
net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not
exceed either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to
debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted investment, the
consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to
the incurrence of such debt; (c) for any such debt that is secured by
assets that do not secure our new senior secured credit facilities, the

consolidated total net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma
basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50:1.00 or (ii) if any such request
is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted
investment, the consolidated total net leverage ratio immediately
prior to the incurrence of such debt; and (d) for any such debt that
is unsecured, either (x) the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in
each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50:1.00
or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in
connection with a permitted investment, the consolidated total net
leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt or
(y) the fixed charge coverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma
basis, is not less than either (i) 2.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request
is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted
investment, the fixed charge coverage ratio immediately prior to
the incurrence of such debt plus (z) an amount equal to all (i)
voluntary prepayments and repurchases of pari passu term loans
borrowed under the credit agreement governing our new senior
secured credit facilities and (ii) voluntary prepayments of revolving
loans borrowed under the credit agreement governing our new
senior secured credit facilities to the extent accompanied by a
corresponding permanent reduction in the commitment therefor,
subject to certain conditions; and

                     - our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries would have represented a limited
minority of our total liabilities, all of which would have been
structurally senior to the Notes.

See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and our indebtedness—
_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of all of_
_our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.”_

**Optional redemption . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Each series of Notes will be redeemable at the Issuers’ option, in
whole or in part, at any time on or after, 2021, at the
applicable redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum,
together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the date of redemption.

At any time prior to, 2021, the Issuers may also redeem

In connection with any offer to purchase all or any of each series of
Notes (including a Change of Control Offer and any tender offer), if
holders of no less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
Notes of such series validly tender their Notes, the Issuers are entitled
to redeem any remaining Notes of such series at the price offered to
each holder.

See “Description of Notes—Optional redemption.”

**Additional amounts; redemption for**
**taxation reasons. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If payments made by the Issuers or any Guarantor Subsidiary are
subject to any withholding of taxes by certain relevant tax
jurisdictions (generally other than the United States or any of its
political subdivisions), subject to certain exceptions, the Issuers and
such Guarantor Subsidiary are required to pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amount received by the holders of the Notes
after the withholding is not less than the amount that they would have
received in the absence of the withholding. In the event that certain
changes in the tax law of any relevant tax jurisdiction would impose
withholding taxes on payments on the Notes, the Issuers may redeem
the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price
of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for taxation
_reasons” and “Description of Notes—Withholding taxes.”_

**Escrow of proceeds; special**
**mandatory redemption . . . . . . . . . . . .** This offering may close prior to or concurrently with the
consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuers will enter into the
Escrow Agreement and, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement, the initial purchasers will deposit the gross proceeds of
this offering into escrow accounts. An affiliate of Carlyle will issue
an irrevocable equity commitment letter to the Dutch Co-Issuer, for
the benefit of the trustee and the holders of each series of Notes, to
transfer to the Dutch Co-Issuer an amount necessary to fund the
payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on each series of Notes in
the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and
expenses. The escrow accounts will not include cash to fund any
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be payable in the
event of a special mandatory redemption. At such time and until the
Escrow Release Condition is satisfied, the Notes will not be
guaranteed and will be secured by a first-priority security interest in
the escrow account in funds held in the escrow account. See
“Description of Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory
_redemption.”_

In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated by the Outside
Date or the Issuers notify the Escrow Agent in writing that
Acquisition Agreement has terminated prior to the Outside Date, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, at a

issue price of the Dollar Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from
the issue date, to, but not including, the date of such mandatory
redemption and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the initial
issue price of the Euro Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from
the issue date, to, but not including, the date of such mandatory

option, in whole but not in part, at any time if, in our reasonable
judgment, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Outside
Date, at a redemption price equal to (x) with respect to the Dollar
Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the Dollar Notes plus accrued
and unpaid interest from the issue date to, but not including, the
redemption date and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the
initial issue price of the Euro Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest
from the issue date to, but not including, the redemption date. The
escrowed funds would be applied to pay for any such special
mandatory redemption. At such time, the Issuers would be required to
pay the accrued and unpaid interest payable to holders of each series
Notes plus certain fees and expenses, which an affiliate of the
Sponsor will have committed to fund. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to the Notes and our indebtedness—In the event that the_
_Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the_
_Dutch Co-Issuer notifies the Escrow Agent that the Acquisition_
_Agreement has terminated prior to the Outside Date, the Notes will be_
_subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may_
_not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.” and “Description of_
_Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” Upon_
delivery to the Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that the
sole condition to the release of the proceeds from escrow are satisfied,
the escrowed funds will be released and utilized as described in “The
_Transactions,” “Use of proceeds” and “Description of Notes—Escrow_
_of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” The escrowed funds_
will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a
Default or Event of Default (each as defined in the Indenture) has
occurred and is continuing (or would have occurred had the Issuers
(after giving effect to the Acquisition) been subject to all of the
provisions of the Indenture as of the date of consummation of this
offering).

**Activities of the Issuers prior to the**
**Closing Date . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition,
the Indenture will require that, prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Issuers’ activities be restricted to issuing the Notes,
issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions,
performing their obligations with respect to the Notes under the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement and their obligations under or
related to the Acquisition Agreement, releasing the escrowed
proceeds and consummating the Acquisition, conducting such other
activities as are necessary, advisable, or appropriate to carry out the
activities related to the foregoing or related to the Transactions, and

redeeming the Notes, if applicable. Prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Issuers may not own, hold or otherwise have any
interest in any assets other than the escrow accounts, subject to
certain exceptions.

**Change of control offer . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change in control, you will
have the right, as holders of the Notes, to cause the Issuers to
repurchase some or all of your Notes at 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding,
the repurchase date. However, a change of control offer will not be
required if a change of control is a “Specified Change of Control
Event.” See “Description of Notes—Change of control” and
“Description of Notes—Certain definitions—Specified Change of
_Control Event.” The Issuers may not be able to pay you the required_
price for Notes you present to us at the time of a change of control
because:

                      - the Issuers may not have enough funds at that time; or

                       - the terms of our new senior secured credit facilities or other debt
facilities may prevent the Issuers from making such payment.

See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and our indebtedness—
_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control_
_or pursuant to an asset sale offer and we will not be required to_
_purchase the Notes upon a Specified Change of Control Event.”_

**Asset disposition offer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If the Issuers or any of their restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under
certain circumstances, the Issuers will be required to use the net
proceeds to make an offer to purchase the Notes at an offer price in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Certain covenants—
_Asset sales.”_

**Covenants . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The Indenture will, among other things, limit the ability of the Issuers
and our restricted subsidiaries to:

                      - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

                      - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or
repurchase or redeem, our capital stock;

                      - prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt;

                       - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;

                     - make loans and investments;

                        - sell assets;

                       - incur liens;

**Summary historical combined carve-out and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data**

The following table sets forth the summary historical combined carve-out financial information of the Specialty
Chemicals business and the summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data of the Dutch
Co-Issuer for the periods and dates indicated.

The balance sheet information as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 and the statement of income and cash
flows information for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017 have been derived
from the audited Annual Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the Specialty Chemicals business
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The balance sheet information as of June 30, 2018 and the statement of income and cash flows information for
the six month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 have been derived from the unaudited Interim Condensed
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the Specialty Chemicals business included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum.

The unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared on the same
basis as the audited Annual Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements and, in the opinion of management of the
Specialty Chemicals business, include all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the information set forth herein. The results of operations included in the
unaudited Interim Condensed Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year or any future reporting period.

The summary unaudited pro forma financial information of the Dutch Co-Issuer for the LTM Period has been
derived from the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements of the Dutch Co-Issuer included
elsewhere in this offering memorandum and has been calculated by adding the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined statement of income (loss) information for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to the unaudited
pro forma condensed combined statement of income (loss) information for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2017 and then subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income (loss) information
for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined
statements of income (loss) information have been adjusted to give effect to the Transactions as if these events
occurred on January 1, 2017. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet information
has been adjusted to give effect to the Transactions as if these events occurred as of June 30, 2018.

(3) Free Cash Flow is, for periods other than the LTM Period, Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures, and, for the LTM
Period, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures.
(4) Cash conversion is, for periods other than the LTM Period, Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures divided by
Adjusted EBITDA, and, for the LTM Period, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA less maintenance capital expenditures divided by Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA.
(5) Pro forma cash interest expense is interest expense less amortization of estimated original issue discount related to our new senior
secured credit facilities and capitalized financing costs for the LTM Period. The actual cash interest expense will depend upon the
interest rates payable on the Notes and our new senior secured credit facilities. See “Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
_information.”_
(6) Gives effect to our new senior secured credit facilities and the Notes offered hereby. It also gives effect to the application of IFRS 16
“Leases” and therefore includes approximately €263 million of estimated capitalized lease obligations as of June 30, 2018. As of
June 30, 2018 we have not adopted IFRS 16 as this standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2019. We have estimated the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 based on a preliminary analysis of our historical
lease payments. Our estimate is not a full reconciliation and is subject to significant simplifications and estimates. The effects of an
actual adoption of IFRS 16 at such earlier time may have differed from the effects presented here, including the application of different
interest rates, renewal periods, and other simplifications employed in our estimate. The actual amount of capitalized lease obligations
may differ from the estimate presented herein and such differences may be material. Under IFRS 16, lessees will recognize a lease
liability (and corresponding lease asset) for almost all lease contracts. A lease contract is the acquisition of a right to use an underlying
asset and having to pay the purchase price in installments. The lessee recognizes the lease liability and the right-of-use asset initially at
the commencement date. At the commencement date, the lessee measures the lease liability at an amount equal to the present value of the
lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements and the unaudited pro
forma condensed combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum do not reflect this expected impact.
Certain financial metrics under the Indenture are measured as if we have adopted IFRS 16. Also includes €25 million of historical
capitalized lease obligations before our adjustment for IFRS 16.
(7) Represents our pro forma total secured debt and our pro forma total debt less pro forma cash and cash equivalents of €300 million. See
“Capitalization.”

**Risk factors**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described_
_below and all of the information contained in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to invest in the_
_Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our_
_business operations. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations would suffer and you could lose all or part of your original investment in the Notes. The risks_
_discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ materially from those_
_discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking_
_statements.”_

**Risks related to our business**

**_Volatility and cyclicality of the global chemicals markets and changes in economic conditions in customer_**
**_industries or end-use markets may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and_**
**_results of operations._**

We are a global business with 67 manufacturing sites worldwide and market our products on an international
basis. Due to the international nature of our business, we are exposed to local and global changes in economic
conditions. We sell our products in markets that are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions,
particularly the building and construction end-use market and certain industrial end-use markets such as oil
drilling and mining. A downturn in general economic conditions could adversely affect the demand for our
products, resulting in downward pressure on the prices, volumes, and margins achieved or achievable going
forward. A decline in demand or a shift to lower-margin products resulting from deteriorating economic
conditions could adversely affect our sales of products and profitability.

Factors affecting economic conditions in the geographic areas in which we operate may have a material impact
on our business. China has accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in Asia. However in recent years,
the growth of China’s GDP has gradually slowed. In addition, production overcapacity could lead to continued
price pressure impacting global profitability. The slowdown of growth in China has affected and may continue to
affect the economic growth of other geographies into which we sell our products, such as Brazil, Russia, and the
Middle East. Current regional tensions and conflicts in energy-producing nations, including continuing instability
throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa, ongoing military action in Afghanistan and Syria and political
tension concerning Iran and the Korean peninsula, may cause increases in raw material costs, particularly of
natural gas and crude oil-based feedstocks, which are important to our operations.

Customers of specialty chemicals companies typically adapt their procurement activities to the expected growth
rates of their business. In a downturn, customers generally try to reduce their working capital and inventories. In
times of recovery, customers tend to increase their inventories, leading to increased demand for specialty
chemicals products. These destocking and restocking activities amplify the impact of changes in underlying
growth rates. Thus, order volumes for specialty chemical products have tended to be volatile in recent periods.
Certain product lines within our IC and ESD product families are more prone to experience periods of volatility,
such as prices of our ethylene amine product lines, which are primarily driven by supply-demand balances. For
example, the announcement of the increased ethylene amine capacity by Sadara had a negative price impact years
before production started.

The correlation of the global chemicals markets with general global economic conditions, together with weak or
declining growth in customer industries or end-user markets, could lead to a reduction in prices and sales
volumes and thus affect sales growth, capacity utilization, and cost absorption, which in turn may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If conditions in the global economy or in the key markets in which we operate deteriorate, it may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

41

**_We face competition from other specialty chemicals companies, which could place downward pressure on_**
**_prices and margins of our products and our failure to compete successfully in product development may have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We operate in competitive industries, in particular with respect to product differentiation, product performance,
customer service, new product development and introduction and the development of integrated systems and
applications that address business challenges faced by our customers. The relative importance of these factors
differs across the geographic markets and product areas in which we serve. Our markets, in particular those with
higher profit margins, may become more competitive, which could lead to pricing and margin pressure. If we are
not in a position to effectively compete with regard to these factors in relevant markets, such failure may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We compete with global, regional, and local companies. Some of our competitors are sophisticated companies
that, in some cases, have significant financial and other resources that may allow them to develop superior
products and services or may allow them to adapt more quickly to new technologies, evolving customer
requirements or general economic and industry changes. Our ability to successfully compete with these
companies highly depends on our ability to keep pace with technological changes in the markets that we serve. If
we fail to anticipate, develop, or do not have sufficient financial resources to respond to these competitive
pressures or technological developments, such failure may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

New competitors may enter our markets and existing competitors may try to expand their product range or
geographical reach. Competitors from emerging markets, particularly China and India, are entering some of our
markets. Competitors in regions such as the U.S. and the Middle East may be better positioned to increase market
share with the customer base located in those regions and compete on price by exporting to customers outside of
these low-cost raw material regions.

Generally, both new and existing competitors may offer their products at lower prices to defend or gain market
share, which could put pressure on our margins. Changes in exchange rates could adversely affect our cost
position vis-a-vis our competitors. Further, substitute products may become more attractive, for example, due to
a price decrease or greater availability of the substitute product, and lead to reduced demand for our products.

Competitors could benefit from favorable tax regimes or additional governmental grants and subsidies. In
addition, certain of our competitors in various countries in which we do business, including China, may be
owned by or affiliated with members of local governments and political entities. These competitors may receive
special treatment with respect to regulatory compliance and product registration, while certain of our products,
including those based on new technologies, may be delayed or even prevented from entering into the local
market. Additionally, because many of our competitors are small divisions of large, international businesses,
these competitors may have access to greater resources than we do and may therefore be better able to withstand
a change in conditions within our industry and throughout the economy as a whole.

Strategic moves by competitors in the markets in which we operate, such as consolidation of the European
specialty chemicals industry, could affect our performance and stability. We believe we currently have leading
positions for the majority of the product-market combinations in which we operate, resulting in commercial and
operational competitive advantages. A consolidation of competitors in these markets could negatively impact
these competitive advantages.

The materialization of any of the aforementioned risks could have material adverse effects on our market position
and market share, as well as our sales, prices and realizable margins, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Price volatility or interruptions in our supply of input chemicals and raw materials may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We use various chemicals and raw materials to manufacture our products and the cost of these chemicals and raw
materials represents a substantial portion of our operating expenses. The availability and prices for some of these
chemicals and raw materials can be volatile and are affected by cyclical movements in prices, demand for a
variety of products which are produced using these chemicals and raw materials, levels of price competition
among local and global suppliers, the financial stability of our suppliers, suppliers’ allocations to other
purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, general economic conditions, and new laws and regulations.
The ability to pass on higher prices for chemicals and raw materials to our customers is partially dependent on
market conditions. If we are unable to pass on higher costs to our customers, this could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The prices for a number of these raw materials partly follow price trends of, and vary with market conditions for,
crude oil and natural gas based feedstocks, which are often volatile and cyclical. For example, the market for
crude oil and natural gas based feedstocks experienced depressed pricing throughout 2015 and 2016, leading to
favorable prices for the raw materials that we purchased from third parties. Conversely, lower raw material prices
can lead to downward pressure on selling prices for certain of our products, potentially leading to reduced
revenue. In 2017, prices for crude oil and natural gas based feedstocks increased, resulting in a corresponding
increase in cost of our raw materials. However, there is a time lag in the pass-through of these raw material costs
to customers via agreed pricing formulas in customer contracts and the usual price renegotiations and market
dynamics. Any limitation on, or delay in, our ability to pass on increased raw material costs to our customers
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Some of our supply agreements contain minimum volume commitments and occasionally take-or-pay
obligations. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding product price increases, we may not
always be able to raise product prices immediately or at all. Timing differences between raw material prices,
which can change constantly, and contract product prices, which in many cases are negotiated on a periodic
basis, have had and may continue to have a negative effect on our cash flows. Where there is significant price
volatility, such as in the case of sulfur, methanol, and acetic acid, we have, to a significant extent, indexed
finished product prices.

In general, the feedstocks and other raw materials that we require are organic base chemicals that are readily
available at market prices. There are, however, several raw materials for which there are only a limited number
of suppliers or a single supplier. For example, ethylene oxide, which is used in Surface Chemistry in the U.S., is
only available from a limited number of suppliers. We operate ethylene oxide value chains in Sweden and China,
consuming ethylene as the key raw material. Regional disparity in prices for ethylene between these two
countries on the one hand, and the U.S. and the Middle East where other competitors consume ethylene on the
other hand, could negatively impact the competitiveness of these value chains. Supply of tert-butyl
hydroperoxide, which is a key feedstock for the Polymer Chemistry product family is also limited to a few
producers.

If certain of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under present supply agreements, we may be
forced to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary raw materials from other sources and may not be able to
increase prices for our finished products to recoup the higher raw materials costs. Any interruption in the supply
of raw materials could lead to a decrease in production and consequently a loss of customers, an increase in our
costs or a decrease in our revenues. The inability of a supplier to meet our raw material needs could therefore
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

43


-----

**_Volatility in the price and supply of energy may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, and results of operations._**

We consume large quantities of electricity and steam from various sources for use in production facilities,
particularly in relation to our two most energy intensive product families, Pulp and Performance Chemicals and
Industrial Chemicals.

Energy prices are volatile and differ between regions. For example, in regions dependent upon shale gas, the
degree of government involvement in energy markets through measures such as energy and carbon taxation
policies and grid fee exemption schemes can have an impact on energy prices. The risk of volatile energy prices
may also further increase as a result of changes in the E.U. emission trading system price or national carbon
policy interventions.

Energy costs constitute a significant proportion of our total production costs. Our profitability depends on our
ability to pass through increases in energy costs to customers at the time such increased costs arise. Although we
have indexed some finished product prices to prices for energy via long-term customer contracts, primarily with
respect to Industrial Chemicals, we may not fully recoup increased costs from our customers or may do so only
after a certain time lag. The failure to pass on higher energy costs to our customers or to do so in an untimely
manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We depend on certain key suppliers and the termination of the underlying contracts and delivery failures may_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We source from hundreds of suppliers, but also depend on approximately 30 strategic suppliers for key raw
materials and energy, such as certain ethylene derivatives and steam, that are necessary to manufacture certain
products. Although we are significantly backward integrated into salt, electricity, and steam, we source the large
majority of our feedstocks from third party suppliers. Failure to maintain existing relationships with these
suppliers could negatively affect our ability to manufacture our products. Such suppliers could also fail to deliver
raw materials in a timely manner, experience quality problems or financial difficulties. We can provide no
assurance that, as our supply contracts expire, we will be able to renew them or, if they are terminated, that we
will be able to obtain replacement supply agreements on terms favorable to us, secure a replacement supplier in a
timely manner or procure raw materials in the same quality or at competitive prices. The inability to source raw
materials or to pass on increased costs associated with such alternative suppliers to our customers could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations.

**_Our global operations subject us to increased risks._**

We have global operations and, accordingly, our business is subject to risks resulting from differing legal and
regulatory requirements, political, social, and economic conditions, and unforeseeable developments in a variety
of jurisdictions. We have a significant presence in a number of major regions, including certain emerging
markets such as India, Brazil, and China, and we plan to continue such expansion. Our global operations are
subject to the following risks, among others:

   - political instability;

   - acts of terrorism and military actions in response to such acts;

   - unexpected changes in regulatory environments and government interference in the economy;

   - changes to sanctions laws and regulations;

   - varying tax regimes, including with respect to the imposition of withholding taxes on remittances and
other payments or charges by or to our partnerships or subsidiaries;

   - the impact of changes in the U.S. federal tax code as a result of recent U.S. federal tax legislation and
uncertainty as to how some of those changes may be applied;

44


-----

   - differing labor regulations, particularly in the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, and China where we have
a significant number of employees;

   - foreign exchange controls and restrictions on repatriation of funds;

   - fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

   - inability to collect payments or seek recourse under, or comply with, ambiguous or vague commercial or
other laws;

   - difficulty in obtaining export licenses or delay or interruption of the transportation of our products;

   - differing protections for intellectual property rights;

   - increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and cyberattacks from third party and state actors and privacy
violations;

   - difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and employees, or rationalizing our
workforce;

   - increased credit risk and different financial conditions of customers and distributors may necessitate
longer payment cycles of accounts receivable or result in increased bad debt write-offs (including due to
bankruptcy) or additions to reserves;

   - differing business practices, which may require us to enter into agreements that include non-standard
terms; and

   - difficulties in penetrating new markets due to entrenched competitors, lack of recognition of our brand
and lack of local acceptance of our products and services.

Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage
these risks and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so without incurring unexpected costs. If we
are not able to manage the risks related to our international operations, there may be a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business in emerging markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries.
Our overall success as a global business depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed in different legal,
regulatory, economic, social, and political conditions. We may not succeed in developing and implementing
policies and strategies which will be effective in each location where we do business. Furthermore, any of the
foregoing factors or any combination thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We may also face difficulties managing and administering an internationally dispersed business. In particular, the
management of our personnel across several countries can present logistical and managerial challenges.
Additionally, international operations present challenges related to operating under different business cultures
and languages. We may have to comply with unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements,
which could negatively impact our operations and ability to manage our global financial resources. Export
controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets.
Moreover, we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property overseas due
to uncertainty of laws and enforcement in a number of countries relating to the protection and enforcement of
intellectual property rights. See “—Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some
_countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States.” Changes in tax_
regulation and international tax treaties could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign
operations or the magnitude of their contributions to our overall financial performance. In addition, the
interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere
are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux.

**_Chemical manufacturing, storage and transportation is inherently subject to material hazards and could result_**
**_in accidents or incidents that could disrupt our operations or expose us to significant losses or liabilities and_**
**_lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

Although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and limit the risk of disruptions, our
operations are subject to hazards inherent in the use, manufacturing, storage, transportation, disposal, and sale of
raw materials, chemical products, and wastes. These hazards include, but are not limited to, pipeline leaks and
ruptures, explosions, fires, severe weather, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity breaches, mechanical
failures, unscheduled downtimes, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, remediation complications,
chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases, storage tank leaks, and other
risks. These hazards may cause bodily injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property and
equipment, or contamination of the environment, which may in turn result in temporary or permanent suspension
or shutdown of operations, loss of permits or licenses, the imposition of material civil or criminal fines, penalties,
and other sanctions, or cleanup costs and claims by governmental entities or third parties. The costs of such an
event may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. Furthermore, such an event could be detrimental to our reputation and could have a material
adverse effect on our ability to obtain or maintain our existing licenses and key commercial regulator and
governmental relationships. We face the risk that individuals could seek damages for personal injury due to
exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances we use, manufacture, store, transport, dispose, and sell. A
periodic shutdown at one of our facilities supplying inputs internally to other of our product groups, such as ESD
supplying ethylene oxide to SC, could have a temporary impact on our overall ability to fully serve our clients or
on our input costs.

We maintain property, business interruption, and casualty insurance policies which we believe are in accordance
with customary industry practices. Such insurance policies are always subject to policy wording, policy limits,
and sub-limits and may contain exclusions, such as for war, nuclear reaction, gradual pollution, wear and tear,
and corrosion without sudden and accidental damage. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles
or self-insured retentions for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and, in some instances, certain
insurance coverage may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to
incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “ —We are not insured against all potential risks.”

**_Disruptions in production at our or third parties’ manufacturing facilities may have a material adverse effect_**
**_on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

Manufacturing facilities in our industry are subject to planned and unplanned production shutdowns, turnarounds,
outages and other disruptions. Any serious disruption at any of our facilities could impair our ability to use our
facilities and have a material adverse impact on our revenues and increase costs and expenses. Alternative
facilities with sufficient capacity may not be available, may cost substantially more, or may take a significant
time to increase production or qualify with our customers, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Long-term production disruptions may cause
customers to seek alternative supply which could further adversely affect profitability.

Unplanned production disruptions may occur for external reasons including natural disasters, weather, disease,
strikes, transportation interruption, government regulation, political unrest or terrorism, or internal reasons, such
as fire, unplanned maintenance or other manufacturing problems. Any such production disruption could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, we rely on a number of vendors, suppliers, and in some cases sole-source suppliers, service
providers, toll manufacturers, and collaborations with other industry participants to provide chemicals,
feedstocks and other raw materials, along with energy sources and, in certain cases, facilities that are needed to
operate our business. If the business of these third parties is disrupted, some of these companies could be forced

46


-----

to reduce their output, shut down their operations, or file for bankruptcy protection. If this were to occur, it could
adversely affect their ability to provide us with the raw materials, energy sources, or facilities that we need,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Moreover, it could be difficult to find replacements for certain of our business partners without incurring
significant delays or cost increases.

While we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other
events that could disrupt our business, we cannot provide assurances that our insurance and recovery plans would
fully protect us from the effects of all such disasters or from events that might increase in frequency or intensity
due to climate change. See “ —We are not insured against all potential risks.” The materialization of any of
these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_A common feature of the production of many specialty chemicals is the simultaneous production of two or_**
**_more substances in one production step, called joint products, exposing us to the risk that quantities of joint_**
**_products can be adjusted only to a limited extent. Any production shortfalls of products further up in the_**
**_production chain may significantly impact the availability of a large number of products further down the_**
**_production chain and, vice versa, any increase in production of one product could lead to oversupply of_**
**_another product._**

A common feature of the production of many specialty chemicals is the simultaneous production of two or more
substances in one production step, called joint products. We often use an integrated production structure where
we either sell products resulting from one production step or use them in the production of further individual
products. Consequently, a decrease in the production of one of the products at the beginning of the production
chain, whether due to supply shortages, technical problems, labor strikes, or other factors, may significantly
impact the availability of a large number of products further down the production chain. Even if such shortages
may be addressed by the supply of products from other plant sites, there is no guarantee that such fallback
capacities will be available. Conversely, an increase in the production of one co-produced product, for example,
due to increased customer demand for such product could lead to oversupply of another product, causing
downward pressure on prices. We aim to sell all resulting products into the market. In some cases, however, an
imbalance in demand across our co-produced chemistries could require us to dispose of one or more such joint
products thereby incurring additional production costs.

For example, in the chlor-alkali business, chlorine, and caustic soda are produced simultaneously through an
industrial electrolysis manufacturing process at a fixed ratio. Produced chlorine is typically transported via
pipelines to downstream producers to produce a wide range of products such as MDI, TDI, PVC, and epoxy
resins. An increase in chlorine demand could lead to oversupply of caustic soda. If sufficient demand for caustic
soda does not exist we may be unable to sell caustic soda at favorable prices, or at all, resulting in increased costs
of storage or disposal.

The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

**_Investments in production facilities expose us to the risk of misallocating resources and any delay or_**
**_interruption in making these investments may result in the failure to meet customer demand, which may have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We may make considerable investments in additional production capacity in order to implement our growth
strategy in our Specialty Chemicals business. Production facilities in the specialty chemicals industry generally
require high initial capital expenditures and continuous investment in modernization and expansion measures.

Our success relies to a certain degree on our ability to pursue a strategy of expanding our operational
manufacturing capacity in markets which we believe have the greatest growth potential. For example, as part of

47


-----

our current expansion program, we plan to expand our capacity for organic peroxides in Ningbo, China which is
expected to become operational at the end of 2018 and plan to construct a new organic peroxides plant in Tianjin,
China which is due to be operational in 2020. In addition, we have also begun construction on a new MCA
facility and partnership with Atul Ltd in India.

Any delay or interruption to the construction of planned additional capacity could have an effect on this
additional capacity coming available in order to meet customer requirements. This could result in customers
sourcing products from our competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. This is particularly true with respect to our new organic peroxides plant that
is being built in Tianjin, China. If the new plant is not operational before closure of the current plant in Tianjin,
this will result in loss of income and could lead to loss of customers and market share and reputational damage.
The current Tianjin site is required to relocate to a dedicated chemicals zone due to its proximity to the
expanding city center and associated change in land use rights.

We may require additional financial resources to fund our planned investments in the medium to long term,
which may be difficult to obtain or result in higher costs and additional covenants. For instance, the availability
and cost of financing is strongly influenced by the macroeconomic environment and other factors influencing the
capital markets. Moreover, we may not be able to find the required management expertise or sufficient highlyskilled personnel to execute our growth strategy, including these investments. Furthermore, it takes time for
newly constructed facilities to become fully operational, as supply chains need to be established, logistics need to
be built up, potential customers need to audit production quality and customer relationships need to be
established. As new facilities add significant fixed costs to our cost base, they may reduce our margin and
profitability to the extent such facilities are unable to reach and maintain a sufficiently high rate of utilization.

If we misjudge market developments or the life cycles of products, or if we underestimate the rate at which our
competitors are expanding their production capacity, we may create excess production capacity that cannot be
utilized as planned. Any such excess of supply over demand may have negative consequences on product pricing
or volumes sold.

In addition, investments in production capacity may be unsuccessful if the products turn out to be uncompetitive
or if research and development expenditures fail to generate anticipated results. Any unnecessary increase in
production capacity and any inefficiencies resulting from the expansion of our production capacity could
materially decrease our margins and require substantial impairments.

Any of these risks, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

**_We spend significant resources on research, development and innovation and depend on our development of_**
**_new, improved, or more cost-effective materials, methods, and technologies. If we are not able to identify and_**
**_adapt to changing technologies in a timely manner, it may have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_financial condition, and results of operations._**

Our success depends on the sustainable retention and growth of our business through research, development, and
innovation. If we are unsuccessful in commercializing research and development efforts and in developing new,
improved, or more cost-effective materials, methods, and technologies in a timely manner, there could be a
material adverse effect on our competitive position and our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Our business is subject to constant and rapid technological change, product obsolescence, price erosion, evolving
standards, short product life-cycles, raw material price fluctuations, and changes in product supply and demand.
The specialty chemicals industry is currently being affected by globalization and a shift in customers’ businesses.
The trends and characteristics in these industries may cause significant fluctuations in our results of operations

48


-----

and cash flows and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Our growth and success depend
upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and
services to keep pace with such changes and developments and to meet changing customer needs and
preferences. If new types of materials or technologies with more favorable characteristics are developed, if
existing materials or technologies are improved by other producers or if technological developments or
improvements in processes result in competitors being able to offer products at lower prices than our products,
there is a risk that customers could replace our products with materials or technologies offered by competitors.
Additionally, our newer products or services may not achieve market acceptance if current or potential customers
do not value the benefits of using our products, do not achieve favorable results using our products, use their
budgets for different products or experience difficulties using our products. If these newer products and services
do not achieve market acceptance, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations and our profitability could decline. Additionally, changes, including technological
changes, in our customers’ products or processes may make our specialty chemicals unnecessary or reduce the
quantity of our specialty chemicals needed for a given product, which would reduce the demand for those
chemicals. We have had, and may continue to have, customers that find alternative materials or processes and
therefore no longer require our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Competition and product standardization in some of our markets increases the importance of research and
development in supporting overall margins, as we must offer more specialized products that are intended to offer
higher value to customers in order to maintain or increase profitability. Recently introduced products typically
have higher profitability margins than “old” products and tend to have higher customer retention. However, we
may not be able to successfully expand or improve our product portfolio or may lack the capacity to invest the
required level of human or financial resources in the development of new products. In addition, although we seek
to maintain close and cooperative relationships with our customers, our relationships could deteriorate in the
future. Any such deterioration would make it more difficult for us to identify customer needs and to develop
customized solutions.

We dedicate extensive resources to research and development, including €106 million of research and
development expenses in fiscal 2017, €105 million of research and development expenses in fiscal 2016, and
€98 million of research and development expenses in fiscal 2015. However, we may commit errors in planning
and misallocate resources, develop products that require large investments in research and development and
capital expenditures but are not commercially viable, fail to anticipate the impact of new and emerging
technology or changes in trends, fail to accurately determine market demand for new products and services,
experience cost overruns, delays in delivery or performance problems and create market confusion by making
changes to our existing products and services. If we are not successful in obtaining any required regulatory
approval or acceptance for new products or services, demand for our products and services may decline and/or
we may not be able to grow our business or growth may occur more slowly than we anticipate.

In addition, the market for a newly developed product may be smaller than expected or cease to exist.
Investments in research and development for future products could also result in higher costs without a
proportional increase in revenues. The most research and development-intensive business is Surface Chemistry
which has several large new products and co-development projects with customers in or close to
commercialization phase. There is no assurance that any of our future research and development projects will be
successful or completed within the anticipated timeframe or budget or that we will receive the necessary
approvals from relevant authorities, customers or prospective customers for the production of new products, or
that these newly developed products will achieve commercial success. The materialization of any of these risks
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Our profitability could suffer if our cost management strategies are unsuccessful or our competitors develop_**
**_competitive advantages that we cannot match._**

Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully manage our costs.
Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our offerings
and our resource capacity and maintaining or improving our sales and marketing and general and administrative
costs as a percentage of revenues. If our cost management efforts are not successful, our efficiency may suffer
and we may not achieve desired levels of profitability. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in
response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to absorb or pass on increases in the compensation
of our employees, we may not be able to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned
rates of growth, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

It may be possible for our current or future competitors to gain an advantage in product technology,
manufacturing technology or process technology, which may allow them to offer products or services that have a
significant advantage over our offerings. Advantages could be in price, capacity, performance, reliability,
serviceability, industry standards or formats, brand and marketing, or other attributes. If we do not compete
successfully by developing and deploying new cost effective products, processes, and technologies on a timely
basis and by adapting to changes in our industry and the global economy, our business, results of operations, and
financial condition could be adversely affected. Similarly, our chemicals are used by manufacturers of
component parts for a variety of industries. To the extent these industries become more sensitive to input costs,
we may face price pressure. Our ability to respond to such pressures depends on the strength and viability of our
internal cost management and pricing programs. Any failure of these programs could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, trade secrets, innovations, and know-how, there could be_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

Our success relies to a certain extent on our ability to protect and preserve intellectual property and other
proprietary information and know-how, including processes, apparatuses, technology, trade secrets, trade names,
and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods, and compounds. The failure to protect such rights could harm
our competitive position with respect to the manufacturing of some of our products, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that any of our patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or otherwise rendered
unenforceable. Furthermore, if any of our pending patent applications do not result in an issued patent, or if
patents are issued, but such patents do not provide meaningful protection of our intellectual property, our ability
to compete may be adversely affected.

In addition to patented intellectual property, we depend on non-patentable trade secrets and confidential
know-how or unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise and continuing technological innovation,
particularly in relation to technically sophisticated products. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality
agreements with certain employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property. However, these
confidentiality agreements may be breached, may not provide meaningful protection for trade secrets or
proprietary know-how or adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or
disclosure of trade secrets and know-how. This risk is particularly prevalent in countries where the laws do not
afford comprehensive protection of such proprietary rights or where the ability to recoup monetary damage for
violations of such proprietary rights is limited. See “—Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less
_effective in some countries where intellectual property rights are not as well protected as in the United States.”_
In addition, others could obtain knowledge of trade secrets through independent development or other access by
legal means.

In addition, we rely on trademarks to protect our brands. We can provide no assurance that our pending
trademark applications will be approved. Failure by us to adequately maintain the quality of our products and

50


-----

services associated with our trademarks or any loss to the distinctiveness of our trademarks may cause us to lose
certain trademark protection, which could result in the loss of goodwill and brand recognition in relation to our
name and products. In addition, successful third-party challenges to the use of any of our trademarks may require
us to rebrand our business or certain products or services associated therewith. Pursuant to the Corporate Brand
License, we have the right to use the AkzoNobel name and brand for 24 months following Closing, and must stop
using the AkzoNobel name and brand worldwide thereafter. There is a risk that we will not successfully stop
using the AkzoNobel brand worldwide in the 24 months following Closing, in which case we will face financial
penalties. We have developed our own name and corporate brand. We plan to implement our new name and
brand before we stop using the AkzoNobel brand and trademarks. We also cannot guarantee our new name and
brand will be protected globally, and we cannot guarantee that our new name and brand will have the same
strength as the AkzoNobel name and brand.

The use of our intellectual property and other proprietary information and know-how by an unauthorized third
party could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage that we have developed and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, there could be a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties’ intellectual property rights. Although we check
freedom to operate with respect to third party intellectual property rights for new products and processes,
competitors or other third parties may obtain patents that restrict or preclude our ability to lawfully produce or
sell our products in a competitive manner, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit,
could: (i) require significant expenditures and time to defend, and we may not be successful in doing so;
(ii) cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
(iii) require us to redesign, reengineer, or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; (iv) divert
management’s attention and resources; (v) require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to
obtain the right to use a third party’s intellectual property or (vi) result in significant monetary damages. Any
royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover,
the scope of our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from designing around such rights,
which could materially adversely affect any competitive advantage we have stemming from those products and
technologies.

**_Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected._**

We believe that our product development, brand recognition and reputation, and the technological and innovative
skills of our personnel are essential to establishing and maintaining our leadership position. We rely on a
combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret rights, confidentiality procedures, technical measures,
and contractual agreements with our customers and employees to establish and protect our intellectual property
(“IP”) rights in our products and services. If we fail to protect our IP rights, our competitive position could suffer,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We may be forced to initiate litigation to protect our IP rights. Litigating claims related to the enforcement of IP
rights is very expensive and can be burdensome in terms of management time and resources, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Moreover, the scope of our IP rights
may not prevent competitors from designing around such rights.

In some cases, we rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise, continuing technological
innovation, and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. While we generally will
enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property, our
confidentiality agreements could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or

51


-----

proprietary manufacturing expertise. In addition, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of
unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise. Violations by others of our
confidentiality agreements and the loss of employees who have specialized knowledge and expertise could harm
our competitive position and cause our sales and operating results to decline as a result of increased competition.

In addition, we rely on both registered and unregistered trademarks to protect our name and brands. Failure by us
to adequately maintain the quality of our products and services associated with our trademarks or any loss to the
distinctiveness of our trademarks may cause us to lose certain trademark protection, which could result in the loss
of goodwill and brand recognition in relation to our name and products. In addition, successful third-party
challenges to the use of any of our trademarks may require us to rebrand our business or certain products or
services associated therewith.

The failure of our patents, applicable intellectual property law or our confidentiality agreements to protect our
intellectual property and other proprietary information, including our processes, apparatuses, technology, trade
secrets, trade names, and proprietary manufacturing expertise, methods, and compounds, or if we are
unsuccessful in our judicial enforcement proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive
advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, and could require us to devote resources advertising and marketing these new brands. Further, we
cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to
enforce our trademarks.

From time to time, competitors challenge the validity of our patents, and we challenge the validity of their
patents. We cannot be certain of either successfully defending the validity of our patents or of invalidating
patents of our competitors.

**_Our efforts to protect our intellectual property may be less effective in some countries where intellectual_**
**_property rights are not as well protected as in the United States._**

The laws of some countries regarding trademark, patent, copyright, and other intellectual property rights do not
protect proprietary rights to the same degree as the laws of the United States and there is a risk that our ability to
protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate in these countries. Many companies have encountered
significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights against copying or infringement in such countries,
some of which are countries in which we intend to operate or to sell our products. In particular, the application of
laws governing intellectual property rights in China is uncertain and evolving and could involve substantial risks
to us. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in China or elsewhere, there could be
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our
competitors in China and these other countries may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our
products, even if unauthorized, which could potentially reduce our sales in these countries and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products, processes, and services
in certain jurisdictions. While we generally consider applying for patents in those countries where we intend to
make, have made, use, or sell patented products, we may not accurately assess all of the countries where patent
protection will ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may
be precluded from doing so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that our pending patent
applications will not be challenged by third parties or that such applications will eventually be issued by the
applicable patent offices as patents. We also cannot assure you that the patents issued as a result of our foreign
patent applications will have the same scope of coverage as our U.S. patents. It is possible that only a limited
number of the pending patent applications will result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems, and any non-availability of our critical_**
**_information technology systems or unauthorized access through cybercrime or other events could have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We rely on IT systems across our operations, including for management, supply chain, and financial information
and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the
security, reliability, and capacity of these systems. IT system failures, network disruptions or breaches of security
could disrupt our operations, cause delays or cancellations of customer orders, impede the manufacture or
shipment of products, result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies or disrupt the reporting of financial
results. An attack or other circumstance beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages,
systems failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, and viruses affecting our systems could also result in the
disclosure of proprietary information about our business or confidential information concerning our customers or
employees, which could result in significant damage to our business and reputation. Current employees have, and
former employees may have, access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could
be disclosed to competitors or otherwise used to harm us.

Further, our IT systems, including those managed by third-party service providers, may be subject to computer
viruses, malicious software, attacks by hackers and other forms of cyber intrusions or unauthorized access, any of
which can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. In addition, a
security breach that leads to disclosure of information protected by privacy laws could compel us to comply with
breach notification requirements under state, national, and federal laws and regulations, potentially resulting in
litigation or regulatory action, or otherwise subjecting us to liability under laws that protect personal data.

During spring of 2017, we faced a short disruption in parts of our SAP and Manufacturing Execution System,
related to our migration to a new hardware provider. Due to our business continuity and contingency plans, we
were able to effectively avoid significant business losses, but in cases of longer or more extensive disruptions to
our IT systems, our business continuity and contingency plans may not be sufficient to fully avoid all business
loss.

We could be required to incur significant additional costs to respond to IT issues or to protect against threatened
or actual security breaches. We may not be able to implement measures that will protect against all of the
significant risks to our IT systems. Our insurance policies include a cyber-security coverage which covers
specific IT-related business interruption losses, however some risks could result in losses in excess of our
insurance coverage. We also attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including
monitoring and testing of our security controls, employee training, and maintenance of protective systems and
contingency plans. Further, our contractual arrangements with service providers aim to ensure that third-party
cybersecurity risks are appropriately mitigated. Nonetheless, it is impossible to eliminate all cybersecurity risk
and thus we remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats. Information security risks have
generally increased in recent years because of the increased proliferation, sophistication, and availability of
complex malware and hacking tools to carry out cyber-attacks. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be
required to expend additional resources to mitigate new and emerging threats while continuing to enhance our
information security capabilities or to investigate and remediate security vulnerabilities.

We will be partly relying on the IT systems of the Seller and its direct and indirect subsidiaries for a transitionary
period of generally 12 to 21 months after the Internal Separation Date. During the transition period, we will
gradually migrate all systems from the Seller’s platform to an independent IT platform. Certain aspects of the
migration will be complex with the risk of disruptions, which may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Loss of customers or renegotiation of contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition, and results of operations._**

We have long-term contractual agreements with approximately one quarter of our customers which typically
include pricing formulas or periodic renegotiation of prices. Due to our diversified business portfolio, we do not

53


-----

have a high degree of customer concentration or exposure to individual customers. However, our largest
customers represent a significant value for us and there is a risk these customers could switch suppliers at the end
of the contract period or renegotiate the contract on terms that are less favorable to us, which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A large portion of our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders from customers, especially for
those products that have a limited degree of technical differentiation. Therefore, these customers may have
flexibility in their choice of preferred supplier at any given time and can cease to buy products from us at any
time and for any reason. If multiple customers elect not to purchase products or purchase fewer products from us
and we are unable to replace the sales volumes generated by such customers, there may be a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, motivate and retain our senior management team and_**
**_qualified personnel may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

The success of our business and the completion and execution of our strategies depend on certain of our key,
highly skilled employees and on the expertise of key personnel such as our executive directors, heads of product
families, regional sales and marketing teams, operations teams, and research and development teams. If we lose
any of such key, highly skilled employees or members of our senior management team, we may not be able to
effectively manage our transition or our current and future operations.

In addition, our business depends on our ability to continue to attract, motivate, and retain a large number of
skilled employees across all of our business lines and we may not be able to retain key employees or to recruit
and train qualified individuals. There is a limited pool of employees who have the requisite skills, training, and
education. We compete with many businesses and organizations that are seeking skilled individuals, particularly
those with experience in technology and the sciences and those with PhDs in technical fields. Competition for
professionals across our entire business can be intense, as other companies seek to enhance their positions in the
markets we serve. In addition, competition for experienced talent in our faster growing geographic areas outside
of Europe continues to intensify, requiring us to increase our focus on attracting and developing highly skilled
employees in our most strategically important locations in those areas of the world. As competition for
experienced talent grows, we may be forced to increase spending on employee salaries which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Future organizational changes, including the Acquisition and the implementation of our cost savings initiatives,
could also cause our employee attrition rate to increase and also may result in significant costs to us in
connection with implementing such initiatives. In addition, we may be perceived as a less attractive employer as
a standalone company. If we are unable to continue to identify or be successful in attracting, motivating, and
retaining appropriately qualified personnel, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be exposed to adverse developments in labor unions and employee relationships, which may cause_**
**_business disruptions or increase personnel costs._**

Due to mandatory law and collective bargaining agreements, we are subject to restrictions on our ability to
terminate or modify agreements with certain employees, which limit our flexibility regarding restructuring
initiatives. We are often required to consult with employees and/or their representatives prior to implementing
restructuring plans. A unionized workforce has in the past, and may in the future, interfere in our restructuring
efforts, which could lead to delays in the implementation of our restructuring plans and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

For example, in 2014, production at our production site in Rotterdam, the Netherlands was disrupted for two
months following a dispute with employees over salary increases. The dispute was resolved upon the conclusion

54


-----

of a collective agreement. In 2014, there also were four one-day strikes over a four week period at our Polymer
Chemistry production site in Deventer, the Netherlands in protest of the announced closure of the site. These
strikes had an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A substantial number
of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

The Company is in the process of negotiating a new collective labor agreement with the unions in the
Netherlands. Negotiations experienced difficulties due to an unfounded request from the unions for financial
support to the Dutch pension fund in the amount of €400 million. These negotiations recently led to a one-day
strike at one of our Dutch plants and a related reduction in production. We cannot make any assurances that the
negotiations will not lead to additional work stoppages or strikes.

We are exposed to potentially adverse developments in labor unions and employee relationships, which may
cause severe business disruptions and/or increase personnel costs and could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be exposed to changes in laws and regulations, or changes in their interpretation or enforcement, and_**
**_may as such not always be in compliance with all laws and regulations or may be exposed to additional costs_**
**_or changes in operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results_**
**_of operations._**

We are subject to extensive laws, regulations, and industry standards in the various jurisdictions where we
operate and market and distribute our products, including environmental, health and safety, product regulatory,
financial, accounting, and tax laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The regulatory
environment for our business activities is continuously changing at international and national levels, including as
a result of technological progress, the public’s increasing awareness with respect to environmental protection and
sustainable development and our customers’ increased demands regarding product quality and specifications.

Testing and other risk evaluation activities have been, and will continue to be, necessary to establish the safety of
our products in relation to evolving scientific standards, such as, for example, pertaining to endocrine disruption.
These evolving standards also have resulted, and will continue to result, in restrictions (and possibly even bans)
on certain chemicals that we manufacture, process, use, or sell as products. Aside from formal laws and
regulations, sustainability programs and societal norms also have been affecting our customers’ preferences,
which may require us to modify or discontinue some of our products and to develop new ones. For example,
some customers have set expectations and/or standards requiring increased biobased content and biodegradability
and for decreased use of plastics or fossil fuel-based feedstocks. This trend toward greater sustainability and
“green chemistry” could cause us to incur additional direct costs or to discontinue certain product lines and to
reformulate others, make changes to our operations and inputs in order to comply with any new regulations and
customer requirements.

Compliance with this complex and frequently changing array of laws, regulations and standards imposed on our
products, services and operations is difficult and may require significant capital and operating expenditures or
lead to additional manufacturing, servicing and quality control measures. There can be no assurance as to the
amount or timing of future expenditures to comply with laws or regulations, and actual future expenditures may
be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. In addition to increasing our costs and liabilities, legal or
regulatory changes could lead to product recalls or impact our ability to manufacture and sell existing products or
develop new products. A material change in applicable laws and regulations, or in their interpretation or
enforcement, may require us to alter our business strategy, leading to additional costs or loss of revenue, which
may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The legal environment in some of the countries in which we operate is different from and may be less stable than
that in Western Europe and North America. In particular, our operations and growth in emerging markets require
us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions within legal and regulatory systems that are less developed

55


-----

and less well-enforced than those in industrialized countries. In addition, the adoption of protectionist measures
in certain countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Due to the complexity and uncertainty of applicability and enforcement of laws and regulations, we cannot
ensure that we have always complied with all applicable national or international rules and regulations (including
but not limited to labor, health and safety, product regulatory, competition and antitrust, criminal, and anticorruption laws). Furthermore, we may be exposed to adverse changes in applicable laws and changes in the
application of certain laws by authorities. Such changes may even have retroactive effects. To the extent we have
failed in the past or fail to fully comply with applicable rules and regulations, such violation could expose us to
civil, criminal and administrative fees, fines, penalties or interruptions in our operations which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Compliance with extensive environmental, health and safety, and product regulatory laws and regulations_**
**_could require material expenditure, changes in our operations, or site remediation, which may have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

We use, and have used in the past, materials, chemicals, organic and inorganic compounds, some of which are
hazardous, and generate by-products and wastes in our product development and manufacturing operations.
Consequently, as a specialty chemicals manufacturer, we are subject to extensive environmental, health and
safety laws and to chemical approvals, registrations and regulations around the world, including the European
Union Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation, and Restriction of Chemicals (“E.U. REACH”) regulation and, in
particular, its Substances of Very High Concern (“SVHC”) program, the Toxic Substances Control Act
(“TSCA”) in the U.S., and similar requirements in China, Korea, Taiwan, Brazil, Canada, and other countries.
Such laws and regulations govern, among other things:

   - our manufacturing processes;

   - the storage, handling, treatment, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances and waste;

   - water discharge;

   - air and noise pollution;

   - occupational health and safety requirements;

   - certain products manufactured by us and certain raw materials used in the production of these products;
and

   - the sale, use, and end-of-life waste management of our products.

These laws and regulations, and their enforcement, may become increasingly stringent in the future and could
require us to incur substantial expenditures relating to regulatory compliance or litigation and could result in
other consequences, such as restrictions or prohibitions on our products. These laws and regulations may affect
production at one or more sites and the marketability of our products and could also restrict or eliminate the use
of, or require us to make modifications to, our products, packaging, manufacturing processes and technology.
The implementation of such rules or regulations, such as E.U. REACH, Regulation (EU) No 528/2012
concerning biocidal products (“BPR”), the 2016 amendments to TSCA and similar rules and regulations in other
jurisdictions, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Compliance with environmental, health and safety and product regulatory laws generally increases the costs of
transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products, as well as the costs of storage and disposal of
wastes.

In July 2017, China implemented additional regulations with respect to waste water. Strict limitations on waste
water were introduced and, as a result, our facility at Ningbo was unable to operate at its intended capacity.

56


-----

Several plants located on the site were completely shut down for seven days from August 10, 2017 to August 18,
2017. Thereafter, production resumed but with strict allocations to the allowable waste water discharge. Further
investments and innovations to mitigate the effect of such regulations are under way across the site. Further,
changes or tightening of environmental protection laws and regulations in China may also have adverse effect on
our business, including by adversely impacting operations efficiency, restricting the scope of our operations,
increasing costs associated with the transportation of chemicals, and resulting in higher costs for environmental
protection taxes and other expenditures.

In addition, our production facilities require permits, such as environmental, operating, and product-related
permits and import/export permits, which are subject to renewal and, in some circumstances, revocation. We may
not obtain the necessary permits, existing permits may be discontinued, and any newly issued permits may
contain significant and costly new requirements. If a permit for a production facility would not be renewed or
would be revoked, the facility may need to be closed temporarily or permanently, which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Global climate change legislation could negatively impact our results of operations or limit our ability to_**
**_operate our business._**

We operate 67 sites in approximately 20 countries across four continents. In many of the countries in which we
operate, legislation has been passed or is being considered to limit greenhouse gases through various means,
including the capping and trading of emissions credits. Greenhouse gas regulation in the jurisdictions in which
we operate could negatively impact our future results of operations through increased production costs. We may
be unable to pass such increased costs on to our customers, or may be unable to do so in a timely manner, which
may decrease our gross profit and negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In
addition, the potential impact of climate change regulation on our customers is highly uncertain and may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may incur material costs relating to environmental and health and safety requirements or liabilities, which_**
**_could result in costs, civil or criminal sanctions or disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

As an international manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals and systems, we are subject to extensive
federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other
things, emissions to the air, discharges to land, surface, subsurface strata, wastewater and storm water discharges,
and the generation, use, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other
materials. We are also required to hold numerous environmental permits related to our operations in various
jurisdictions. Our operations bear the risk of violations of those laws and permits and many of our current and
former sites have an extensive history of industrial chemical processing, storage and related activities, and some
of our buildings have in the past contained and may still contain asbestos or other harmful substances.

As is typical for such businesses, soil and ground water contamination has occurred in the past at various sites of
ours and may occur, or be discovered, at our current and former sites in the future. In addition, we have been, and
in the future could be, responsible for cleanup costs relating to disposal of hazardous wastes at third-party waste
disposal sites. We use technologically advanced control measures for handling chemicals and disposing of waste
and believe that the risk of new contamination has declined over time. Nonetheless, although we believe that we
are largely aware of historic contamination, there is a risk that we will discover historic contamination of which
we are currently unaware, that future contamination could arise, or that historic contamination may be more
extensive than expected. Moreover, although it is our policy to comply with such laws, permits, and regulations,
it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements. Many
of our products are inherently hazardous and our research and development, manufacturing, formulation, and
packaging activities involve the use of hazardous materials and the generation of hazardous waste. Furthermore,
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination, discharge, or injury resulting from these materials.

57


-----

As a result, we could in the future incur significant liabilities, including cleanup costs, fines and sanctions, and
third-party claims for property or natural resource damages or personal injuries, any of which could be material.
There are proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of chemicals or waste
materials into the air, water, or soil, pending against us in various countries. In some cases, these proceedings
concern sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past.

Liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be joint and several and imposed
retroactively, regardless of fault or the legality of the activities that gave rise to the contamination. There is
historic soil and groundwater contamination at several of our current and former sites that will require
investigation, remediation and long-term monitoring expenditures by us or our predecessors for the foreseeable
future. For example, in connection with the production site in Bohus, Sweden, parts of the site are contaminated
with heavy metals and dioxins. Due to the contamination, the Swedish regulatory authorities required
remediation of unused areas of land. In a judgment dated April 5, 2013, the Swedish court approved the plan
relating to the execution of the soil remediation consisting of excavation and the establishment of a barrier to
protect the river next to the site. According to the judgment, the remediation work should be finalized in 2026,
however, additional investigations and remediation could be required as additional areas of the site become
vacant.

In accordance with International Accounting Standards, provisions for environmental obligations are recognized
when an outflow of economic benefits is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated. The provisions in
the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements for environmental costs (including costs for investigation,
remediation, and monitoring) amounted to €105 million in fiscal 2017, €133 million in fiscal 2016, and
€163 million in fiscal 2015. We believe that the provisions established are appropriate to meet our present
environmental obligations at our current and former sites, as well as for retained liabilities in connection with
divested businesses. However, such provisions may prove insufficient as they are based on current obligations
and certain assumptions and estimates that may prove incorrect and additional environmental costs and liabilities
may need to be incurred in the future in excess of these provisions.

Environmental liabilities can change substantially, including due to the emergence of additional information on
the nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, the necessity of employing particular
methods of remediation, discontinuation of activities, changes in laws and regulations, actions by governmental
agencies or private parties, or other factors. Provisions for additional environmental liabilities could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In Hengelo, the Netherlands where we face possible enforcement proceedings by the Dutch supervisor of mines
(Staatstoezicht op de Mijnen) relating to the historic leakage of oil from inactive wells at a salt mining field as
well as brine leaking incidents in the horizontal water and brine pipeline network. In addition, the Dutch
prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation into the incident reporting process for the inactive well leakage.
Currently, it is unknown if any remediation measures will be required as the contamination occurred very deep
underground and does not pose a risk to human health. Should remediation be required and should we be held
responsible for all or any part of it, the costs of remediation of wells and for pipeline repairs could be substantial
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Another example of possible contingent liability concerns the disposal of barrels with production waste in the
Gulf of Bothnia in the period between 1952 and 1964 which may be contaminated with mercury. In 2015, the
County Administrative Board of Västernorrland in Sweden concluded that Akzo Nobel Bygglim AB and a
Swedish third party company were jointly liable to perform further investigations with respect to the possible
contamination. We believe that a divested predecessor company is responsible for the liability, if any, but are
voluntarily cooperating with the preliminary investigation that will be conducted by the County Administrative
Board.

Liabilities or lawsuits related to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations and could, in addition, harm our reputation and customer relations.

58


-----

**_We may be subject to indemnity claims or liable for other payments relating to businesses that have been_**
**_divested._**

The Seller and its affiliates have provided various indemnities and warranties in respect of past divestments of
Specialty Chemicals business activities to the relevant purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable).
Liabilities in relation to divested Specialty Chemicals business activities, including any pending claims, have
been allocated to us, with the exception of the former chemicals activities of a previously acquired business that
were no longer part of the activities of such business at the time of its acquisition on January 2, 2008 and the
residual part of such business’ activities that were divested by the Seller in 2008 and 2010.

The Seller has received various claims under such indemnities and warranties, mainly relating to environmental
matters. In some instances, the Seller has been named as a direct defendant despite the divestments. The claims
received so far have not had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We may,
however, receive claims under indemnities and warranties in the future which may require us to pay damages
which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We are not insured against all potential risks._**

To the extent available, we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is customary in our industry. Such
insurance does not, however, provide coverage for all liabilities, including certain hazards incidental to our
business, and we can provide no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may
arise or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. For example, the
occurrence of a significant business interruption in the operation of one or more of our key facilities, countries,
partners, or systems could result in liability to us that is not insured and therefore could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our products are used in or integrated with
many high-risk end products and therefore if such products were involved in a disaster or catastrophic accident,
we could be involved in litigation arising out of such incidents and susceptible to significant expenses or losses.

In addition, insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other
disasters. In areas prone to frequent natural or other disasters, insurance may become increasingly expensive or
not available at all. Furthermore, some potential climate-driven losses, particularly inundation due to rising
sea-levels, may pose long-term risks to our physical facilities such that operations cannot be restored in their
current locations.

**_Violations of anti-trust laws, anti-corruption laws, export controls and international sanctions laws or data_**
**_privacy laws of the United States and various international jurisdictions may have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

As a global business, we are exposed to several regulatory regimes including anti-trust laws, anti-corruption
laws, export controls and international sanctions laws, data privacy laws, and human rights laws.

In recent years, anti-trust claims have been made against chemical companies, including the Seller. For example,
the Seller was, together with others, involved in civil proceedings initiated by Cartel Damages Claims HP SA/
NV before the Dortmund Court in Germany in relation to the hydrogen peroxide infringement in the 1990s. This
claim, related to the Specialty Chemicals business, was settled in June 2017. In addition, an appeal by the Seller
was pending with the European Court of Justice against the ruling of the General Court on the decision by the
European Commission to impose fines in the total amount of approximately €40 million on certain subsidiaries
of the Seller for violations of E.U. competition laws regarding heat stabilizers in the 1980s and 1990s. The
European court ruled against the Seller in April 2017. The outstanding portion of the fine in the amount of
approximately €10 million has been paid and the matter is closed.

There can be no assurance that we will not be exposed to additional claims and proceedings relating to violation
of anti-trust laws. Due to increasingly active scrutiny by regulators and our global presence, including in certain

59


-----

markets where the risk of non-compliance with antitrust laws is perceived to be relatively high, we remain
exposed to non-compliance with anti-trust laws. Anti-trust law violations, allegations of such violations and
related investigations may lead to fines, legal proceedings, damages, or harm to our reputation, and could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our international operations require us to comply with international and national laws and regulations regarding
anti-bribery and anti-corruption, imposed by governments around the world with jurisdiction over our operations,
including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (“UK Bribery Act”),
as well as the laws of the countries where we do business. These laws and regulations may restrict our operations,
trade practices, investment decisions, and partnering activities. The FCPA and the UK Bribery Act prohibit us
and our officers, directors, employees and business partners acting on our behalf, including agents
(“representatives”), from corruptly offering, promising, authorizing, or providing anything of value to foreign
government officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or
otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The UK Bribery Act also prohibits non-governmental commercial
bribery, soliciting or accepting bribes, and “facilitation payments,” or small payments to low-level government
officials to expedite routine approvals. We also are subject to the jurisdiction of various governments and
regulatory agencies around the world, which may bring our personnel and representatives into contact with
foreign government officials responsible for issuing or renewing permits, licenses, or approvals or for enforcing
other governmental regulations. We operate in parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption
to some degree, including in high-risk markets in Asia and Africa. Some of the international locations in which
we operate lack a well-developed legal system, and others are perceived to have elevated levels of public
corruption. Our global operations expose us to the risk of violating, or being accused of violating, anti-corruption
laws and regulations. For example, our employees frequently interact with government officials with respect to
specialty chemicals projects. We also use third parties in high-risk markets, which pose an inherent risk to strict
compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.

Foreign companies, including some that may compete with us, may not be subject to the prohibitions listed
above, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. We maintain policies and procedures reasonably
designed to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws and regulations. However, there can be no guarantee
that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives for which
we may be held responsible. Our failure to successfully comply with these laws and regulations may expose us to
reputational harm as well as significant sanctions, including criminal fines, imprisonment, civil penalties,
disgorgement of profits, injunctions, and debarment from government contracts, as well as other remedial
measures. Investigations of alleged violations can be expensive and disruptive.

Export control laws and sanctions regimes imposed by governments, including those imposed by the E.U., the
U.S. and its Office of Foreign Assets Control, or other countries or international bodies prohibit us from
engaging in trade or financial transactions with certain countries, businesses, organizations and individuals. Our
operations in certain countries, the products we handle, and the services we render could bring us within the
scope of such export controls and sanctions regimes. For example, we currently have customers in Iran, Cuba,
and the Crimea region of Ukraine, which are subject to comprehensive trade and economic sanctions under U.S.
and E.U. law. However, we expect to cease all sales into Cuba prior to the Closing Date and all sales into Iran by
November 1, 2018. The legislation, rules, and regulations which establish export controls and sanctions regimes
are often broad in scope, and in recent years, governments have increased and strengthened such regimes. A
violation of European, U.S. or international sanctions or export control laws may result in fines or other penalties
that may have a negative impact on our reputation and the ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions or
access the U.S. or international capital markets. Any export controls and sanctions regime may, even without it
being violated directly, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We are also subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations of the E.U. and other jurisdictions regarding
the collection, retention, sharing, and protection of data from and concerning our customers, employees, and third

60


-----

parties. The interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and
elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. For example, the European Union’s General Data
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, created a range of new compliance
obligations and increased financial penalties for noncompliance. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted
and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices, which could result in government-imposed
fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices. Complying with these various laws could cause us to
incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner that may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We make use of innovative products and services that give rise to increased risk of non-compliance under the
legal data protection frameworks. We are subject to E.U. data protection laws in certain jurisdiction but may
process (or have third party service providers process) personal data in other jurisdictions that do not offer a
similar level of data protection, which may lead to an increased risk of non-compliance with E.U. data protection
legislation. Security breaches may lead to unlawful use of personal data for which we are responsible, as well as
notification obligations towards data protection authorities or individuals, damage to our reputation and claims
from individuals. Any failure to comply with privacy laws and regulations or data protection policies may lead to
fines and may undermine our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We have implemented a program to address compliance with anti-trust laws, anti-corruption laws, export
controls, and international sanctions laws and data privacy laws, including raising awareness via training and
communication campaigns. However, our compliance program and internal control policies and procedures have
not always and, in the future, may not always protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our
employees or agents. See “—Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including
_noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, internal codes of conduct and/or insider trading_
_prohibition.” In addition to the risks set out above, violation of anti-trust laws, anti-corruption laws, export_
controls and international sanctions laws, and data privacy laws could result in a default under our existing or
future debt instruments, which may cause cross-default or cross-acceleration, causing debt to become due and
payable. Our assets and cash flows may not be sufficient to fully repay such debt in all circumstances.

**_Our financial results may be affected by tariffs or border adjustment taxes or other adverse trade restrictions._**

We have global operations, including a significant presence in a number of major regions, including markets
such as the European Union and China. We cannot predict whether the countries in which we operate, or may
operate in the future, could become subject to new or additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States
or other governments, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. The United States
government is contemplating and has imposed various actions regarding trade with China, including levying
various tariffs on imports from China. There is increased uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the
United States and other countries. Trade restrictions, including increased customs restrictions and tariffs or
quotas or the imposition of additional duties and other charges on imports and exports, as well as labor strikes,
work stoppages or boycotts, could increase our costs or impede the timely delivery of our products and have an
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with_**
**_regulatory standards and requirements and internal codes of conduct._**

We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include
intentional failures to comply with applicable regulations, provide accurate information to U.S. or other
regulators, comply with manufacturing standards we have established, comply with federal and state fraud and
abuse laws and regulations in the United States and other countries or jurisdictions, report financial information
or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. It is not always possible to identify and deter
employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in

61


-----

controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other
actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations, including
applicable environmental laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not
successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_The results of the United Kingdom’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a_**
**_negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business._**

We have material business operations in Europe. Following a national referendum in which a majority of voters
in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union, the government of the United Kingdom
formally initiated the process for withdrawal pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty on March 29, 2017. The
terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the initiation
date. Nevertheless, the proposed withdrawal has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship
between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and has given rise to calls for the governments of other
European Union member states to consider withdrawal.

These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had, and may continue to have, a
material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and could
significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain
financial markets. Asset valuations, foreign currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the Euro and the
British pound in particular, and credit ratings may be especially subject to increased market volatility. Lack of
clarity about future United Kingdom laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European
Union laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal could depress economic activity and restrict our
access to capital before, during, and after the period of negotiation. The impact of the withdrawal, if any, will
depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, immigration, and other negotiations between the
United Kingdom and the European Union. If the United Kingdom and the European Union are unable to
negotiate acceptable withdrawal terms or if other European Union member states pursue withdrawal, barrier-free
access between the United Kingdom and other European Union member states or among the European Economic
Area overall could be diminished or eliminated. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be liable for damages based on product liability claims, including claims brought against our_**
**_customers in end-use markets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,_**
**_and results of operations._**

We produce and use hazardous chemicals, the handling and use of which requires appropriate procedures and
care. As a result of the hazardous nature of some of the products we produce and use, we may face claims
relating to incidents that involve our customers’ improper handling, storage, and use of our products.

In addition, many of our products provide critical performance attributes to end products whose users who could
potentially bring product liability suits related to such end products. The sale of our products involves the risk of
product liability claims, including class action lawsuits that claim liability for death, injury, or property damage
caused by products that we manufacture or that contain our products. If a person were to bring a product liability
suit against one of our customers, this customer may attempt to seek contribution from us. A person may also
bring a product liability claim directly against us. We have insurance coverage against product liability claims,
but a product liability claim or series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage. See “ —We are not insured
_against all potential risks.” A successful product liability claim or series of claims against us in excess of our_
insurance coverage, for which we are not otherwise indemnified, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a successful product liability claim or series
of claims could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, especially if the claim relates to bodily injury or
loss of life. While we endeavor to protect ourselves from such claims and exposures in our contractual

62


-----

negotiations, we can provide no assurance that our efforts in this regard will ultimately protect us from any such
claims.

**_We are involved in or may become involved in legal proceedings._**

We are involved in and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and claims, including those
arising in the ordinary course of business, relating to such matters as product liability, environmental pollution or
non-compliance, competition issues, disputes with tax authorities and intellectual property infringements,
employment matters, breach of contract, and other commercial matters. See “Business—Legal proceedings.”
While the outcome of pending claims and disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final
outcome will not materially affect our consolidated financial position. However, due to the inherent uncertainty
in the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could result in changes to our products
and business practices and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations. There can also be no assurance that we will not be exposed to additional claims and legal
proceedings in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Litigation can be expensive and time-consuming, regardless of the merits of any claim, and could divert
management’s attention from operating the business. Specifically in relation to intellectual property litigation, if
we were to discover that our processes, technologies, or products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of
others, we might need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer products in order to avoid
infringement. See “—If third parties claim that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights, there could be
_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” We may not be able to_
obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer products successfully.
Moreover, if we are sued for infringement and loss, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be
prevented from using or selling the infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to
incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products.

We make provisions if a cash outflow with respect to legal proceedings is probable and the amount can be
estimated reliably. However, such provisions may prove insufficient. In addition, it is possible that judgments
could be rendered against us that exceed our insurance coverage or are not otherwise subject to third party
indemnities.

For example, we have reserved $7.5 million in connection with a claim from the ultimate owners (the
“Goldschmidt Group”) of a pine forestry company (“Pino Camby”) and a resins company (“International Pine
Products”) that sold their IPP resins business but not their crude pine forest business to a former affiliate in 2000.
In a mutually exclusive supply agreement, entered into as part of the acquisition, it was agreed that IPP would
source crude pine resin for its business from Pino Camby. It appeared that Pino Camby was incapable of meeting
its supply obligations in spite of substantial pre-payments and IPP was obliged to procure crude pine resin from
other sources. Not long afterwards, Pino Camby filed for bankruptcy. It further appeared that under ownership of
the Goldschmidt Group, IPP had provided undisclosed guarantees to banking creditors of Pino Camby and IPP
then filed for “chapter 11-like” protection. In 2005 the bankruptcy liquidator of Pino Camby filed a claim in
arbitration alleging breach of contract causing Pino Camby to enter into bankruptcy, seeking lost profits for the
original contract period of 20 years in the amount of $120 million. By a 2006 decision of the tribunal Pino
Camby’s claims were dismissed. However in 2008, two other companies of the Goldschmidt Group called
“Damela Establishment (Damela)” and “Harz und Derivate (HuD)”, as former shareholders of Pino Camby, filed
a claim with another tribunal (the General Arbitration Tribunal of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange), making
similar claims and alleging damages significantly in excess of the original claim for lost commissions and lost
profits plus interests for an indefinite period of time, which amounts are alleged by the plaintiffs to far exceed the
value of the underlying contract. On May 6, 2017 the Permanent Arbiters of the General Arbitration Tribunal
awarded Damela $4.6 million plus interest as of 2004 for certain withheld payments and dismissed all other
claims. Damela and HuD have appealed the decision in the National Chamber of the Commercial Appellate

63


-----

Court of Buenos Aires (the “Appellate Court”) seeking annulment of the 2017 decision by the Arbitration
Tribunal. While we have also filed an appeal, we have nevertheless reserved the amount owed in connection with
the arbitration tribunal’s award including interest. We do not believe the Damela and HuD claims or their
methodology for calculating damages have any merit. However, it is impossible to predict how the Appellate
Court will rule and there is a remote possibility that the Appellate Court will rule in favor of Damela and HuD
for a material sum. In that event we will appeal such decision to the Supreme Court of Argentina. Even if we
prevail in the pending Appellate Court proceedings, there can be no assurance that Damela and HuD will not
appeal the decision, and if they do, there can be no assurance that other courts will not rule in their favor and
award them damages for a material sum. If the court does not rule in our favor, it could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Any of the foregoing circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

**_We are exposed to the movement of foreign currency exchange rates, predominantly versus the Euro._**

We are engaged in an international business that operates in, and makes sales into, countries utilizing currencies
other than our reporting currency, the Euro. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks in
the ordinary course of our operations. We are primarily affected by movements in foreign currency exchange
rates in two ways: (i) through translation of foreign currency financial statements into Euro during consolidation
(“translation risk”) and (ii) through transactions by our subsidiaries in currencies other than their own functional
currencies (“transaction risk”).

Translation risk arises during the preparation of our combined financial statements (including the Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum). We present our combined
financial statements in Euro, while the functional currency of each of our subsidiaries varies geographically. As a
result of our global operations, we have a number of subsidiaries located outside the Eurozone and with a
functional currency other than the Euro. In preparing the combined financial statements, the assets and liabilities
of foreign non-Euro operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are
translated to Euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are
translated to Euro at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Accordingly, movements in foreign currency
exchange rates against the Euro may result in an adverse change in the reported income or balance sheet items
from non-Euro operations. Examples of translation risk to which we may be exposed include:

   - translation exposure of net income in foreign operations. Our income from operations is sensitive in
particular to movements in the U.S. dollar (including currencies pegged to the U.S. dollar) and a wide
range of other currencies from developed and emerging markets. A weakening of the U.S. dollar and
Chinese renminbi would generally have a negative impact on our income from operations.

   - translation exposure of foreign-currency intercompany and external debt and deposits. We generally
carry foreign-currency intercompany and external debt and deposits on the balance sheet of our foreign
operations. Movements in foreign currency rates may have an adverse impact on the value of such
balance items when translated into Euro; and

   - translation exposure to equity interests in non-functional-currency investments in associates and
available-for-sale financial assets.

Transaction risk arises when our subsidiaries conduct transactions in currencies other than their own functional
currency. We are therefore exposed to foreign currency risks in connection with scheduled payments and receipts
in multiple currencies. Examples of transaction risk to which we may be exposed include transaction exposures
related to sales and purchases in currencies other than the functional currency and the on-balance-sheet
receivables/payables resulting from such transactions. In particular, we have significant manufacturing
operations in Sweden resulting in manufacturing spending denominated in Swedish Krona while the products

64


-----

produced in Sweden are largely sold in transactions denominated in Euros and U.S. dollars. In addition a
significant part of the products produced in South America, and part of the products produced in the Eurozone, is
sold in U.S. dollars. This means that we have a net short position in Swedish Krona and a net long position in
U.S. dollars.

It is our policy to reduce the year-to-year volatility caused by foreign-currency movements on our net earnings
by hedging the anticipated net exposure of foreign currencies resulting from foreign-currency sales and
purchases. Our policy requires significant committed foreign currency exposures to be fully hedged, generally
using forwards. Consequently, most of our committed foreign currency exposure is fully hedged. However, not
every foreign currency can or will be hedged as there may be regulatory barriers or prohibitive hedging cost
preventing us from effectively or efficiently hedging our currency exposures. As a result, hedging activities
cannot and will not eliminate all currency risks for transaction exposures. In addition, our hedging strategies may
be based on estimates for future transactions denominated in a foreign currency or other assumptions.

However, to the extent our currency exposure is not or not effectively hedged, an appreciation of those currencies
may result in a relative increase in our reported costs of goods sold as compared to competitors that incur costs
and generate sales in the same currency. As a result, we may be forced to offer our products only at a
comparatively higher price or to accept lower gross margins if foreign currency exchange rates develop
unfavorably.

Any of the foregoing foreign currency exchange rate related risks may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may be adversely affected by regulatory restrictions on cross-border payment flows or currency_**
**_conversions._**

We sell our products on a worldwide basis and supply markets from manufacturing locations in various
countries. This requires us to make regular cash payments from markets where our products are sold to the
jurisdictions where our products are manufactured. We operate a global network of bank accounts to centralize/
pool cash and provide intercompany funding to certain foreign subsidiaries. We face cash payment and currency
conversion restrictions in China and, to a lesser extent, in certain countries in South America. Such regulatory
restrictions on foreign currency conversions or cross border payments may adversely affect our ability to conduct
our regular business and block our unrestricted access to and use of our cash resources, which may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We have pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans in a number of countries. The funded status_**
**_and the cost of maintaining these plans are influenced by variable factors which may have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations._**

Following the Internal Separation, certain defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, and other postretirement benefit plans were allocated to us. As of fiscal 2017, the largest defined benefit plans are in Germany
and the United States, which together account for 77% of our defined benefit retirement obligations and 65% of
our plan assets. The plans in Germany are largely unfunded. Other defined benefit pension plans include the
plans in Belgium, Sweden, and Switzerland. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of
service and employees’ compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in
the countries of establishment.

Almost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members, although in many plans, long-serving
employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the United States, the benefit accrual is frozen and employees
participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where plans are closed, new employees
are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement.

65


-----

The accounting for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make estimates on discount rates,
inflation, longevity and expected rates of compensation. Movements, including macroeconomic changes, in these
assumptions can have a significant impact on the defined benefit obligations, pension cost, and cash
contributions. A negative performance of the financial markets may have a material impact on the value of
defined benefit plan assets and create or increase the need for us to provide immediate or delayed cash funding.

The expenses of all plans accounted for as defined contribution plans and allocated to us totaled €68 million in
fiscal 2017, €71 million in fiscal 2016, and €60 million in fiscal 2015.

In addition to pension plans, we also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees,
mainly in the United States and Belgium. These healthcare plans expose us to potential risks, including the risk
of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the cost of maintaining the plans. In addition,
the plans expose us to the risk of a further decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and
longevity risk as the plans generally pay lifetime benefits.

Management has assessed the accounting treatment (defined benefit or defined contribution) for each postretirement benefit plan on the basis of applicable accounting rules, existing legal, and regulatory requirements,
funding agreements, and any other available facts or circumstances. Future changes in legislation or regulations,
accounting rules, or other facts or circumstances may require us to reassess this accounting classification and
subsequently recognize or de-recognize defined-benefit obligations on our balance sheet.

Various factors, such as changes in actuarial estimates and assumptions (including in relation to life expectancy
and rate of return on assets) as well as actual return on assets, can increase the expenses and liabilities of the
defined benefit pension plans. The assets and liabilities of the plans must be valued from time to time under
applicable funding rules, and as a result we may be required to increase the cash payments in relation to these
defined benefit pension plans. To the extent any of these plans are or become in the future underfunded or
unfunded, the liabilities in relation to these plans will need to be satisfied from our operating reserves as they
mature. The risks related to pension plans and post-retirement benefit plans mentioned above could result in
higher pension liabilities and consequently may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

For more information see Note 17 “Post-retirement benefit provisions” to the Annual Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_We conduct our business in multiple jurisdictions and are exposed to the tax laws of such jurisdictions,_**
**_including risks in connection with challenges to our tax position. In addition, we are exposed to a number of_**
**_different fiscal uncertainties which may have a significant impact on local tax results._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the
international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to
intercompany pricing laws, including those relating to the flow of funds between our companies pursuant to, for
example, purchase agreements, licensing agreements, or other arrangements. Given that tax laws and regulations
are subject to frequent change, including changes following from implementation of the anti-Base Erosion and
Profit Shifting project of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, from the
implementation of the E.U. Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive, and from the recent U.S. tax reform legislation, and
that the meaning of these tax laws and regulations may be ambiguous, our tax positions are sometimes based on
our interpretations of such laws and regulations. We cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be
questioned by the relevant authorities. The tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the
positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our
transactions, including the tax treatment or characterization of our indebtedness. We can also not guarantee that
any advance pricing agreements and advance tax rulings concluded with local authorities will, upon expiry, be
extended on the same terms. Further, the authorities may not agree with the tax advice that we receive from our

66


-----

outside tax advisors. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions, it could result in the disallowance of deductions, the imposition of
withholding taxes, the reallocation of income or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In addition, in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly in emerging markets, the legal systems
are in varying stages of development. This creates an uncertain business and investment environment and related
additional risks. More generally, any failure to comply with the tax laws or regulations applicable to us may
result in reassessments, late payment interest, fines, and penalties. In addition, as a global business, our effective
average tax rate from period to period will be affected by many factors, including changes in tax legislation,
global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill
impairments, acquisitions and dispositions, adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions, and
changes in valuation allowances. Any significant increase in our tax burden and any adverse developments in
these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of
these laws or regulations in any applicable jurisdiction above is may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

There has, in recent years, been an increased interest by governments, political parties, the media, and the public
in the tax affairs of companies. This increased interest may also apply to our tax policy or the tax affairs of our
customers. Changes as to what is perceived by governments or by the public to be appropriate, ethical or
sustainable behavior in relation to tax may lead to a situation where our tax policy is in line with all applicable
tax laws, rules and regulations, but, nevertheless, comes under public scrutiny. These developments may lead to
reputational damage and damage to our brand.

We may also face certain tax risks in relation to the Acquisition. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the
_Acquisition.”_

**_We own less than 100% in certain companies and this ownership structure carries certain risks._**

In addition to our wholly-owned subsidiaries, we hold participating interests in certain companies. From time to
time, we enter into joint ventures with strategic partners. A key purpose of foreign joint ventures is to develop
international markets, since we may not have the necessary expertise to access the relevant market. In addition,
we may enter into joint ventures in order to gain access to relevant know-how or raw materials on preferential
terms. As of December 31, 2017, our most material joint ventures were Delamine B.V. relating to Industrial
Chemicals, Eka Chile SA relating to Pulp and Performance Chemicals and Fort Amanda Specialties LLC relating
to Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives.

Owning less than a 100% interest carries certain risks, especially if such interest does not represent a controlling
influence. These risks include:

   - Conflicts between the policies or objectives adopted by our partners and those adopted by us or
non-compliance by such partner with the policies or objectives adopted by us;

   - Disagreement with our partners over the performance of their obligations;

   - Disputes as to the scope of each party’s responsibilities;

   - Financial difficulties encountered by our partners affecting their ability to perform their obligations;

   - Financial or other obligations of joint ventures, which may be partially guaranteed by us in certain
locations; and

   - Exposure to liabilities due to non-compliance by the joint venture or the partner with our management
and operating standards, controls, and procedures.

67


-----

These and other risks may result in management difficulties and an inability to distribute profits or make further
necessary investments. In some cases, we may receive less information on the business activities of these
companies than it would on one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and we will typically not have full control over
the companies’ conduct of business. If such conflicts or problems arise, they could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In some cases, our partners may provide a large portion of the capital investment for a project and/or provide
materials, real estate, or other services. In the corresponding agreements, we may agree with the joint venture
partners or the joint ventures to provide materials or to perform certain services for the project. If we fail to
fulfill, or if a partner alleges that we have failed to fulfill, our obligations under these contracts, either in whole or
in part, this may lead to claims for damages, contractual penalties, or termination of the joint venture by the
partner or by the joint venture.

The success of a joint venture requires that the respective partners constructively pursue the same goals. The
successful implementation of a project may therefore be jeopardized or impaired due to management difficulties,
a breach of contract by a partner or the joint venture or through other unforeseen events. We may lack sufficient
control over, and information regarding, our joint venture. This is especially true for joint ventures in regions
where we are a new market entrant. Illegal or unethical activities by the joint venture partner may have negative
consequences for our reputation, business standing and may result in legal disputes, fines, or other adverse
consequences. In addition, technology and know-how may also be revealed or required to be revealed to joint
venture partners and, particularly in countries with comparatively less stringent intellectual property protection.
These partners may use this technology and know-how for their own purposes outside the scope of the relevant
project. Non-competition undertakings in joint venture agreements may prevent us from rendering services or
producing, marketing and distributing the relevant products for our own account in certain markets. Moreover,
we may not be able to exit a joint venture in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all.

In the event of the loss of a joint venture partner, we may be required to make a compensation payment to such
partner, and considerable resources may need to be invested in a new partnership. Alternatively, we may decide
to leave the relevant country, in which case we may not be able to recover the investments we made there. In
addition, conflicts with our partners or the failure of one of our joint ventures or joint undertakings could lead to
the loss of the respective investment and prevent us from implementing our strategy. In many cases, joint venture
agreements are subject to foreign laws, the effect of which might be difficult to predict. Potential disputes with
joint venture partners may fall under the jurisdiction of foreign courts or arbitral tribunals, which might lead to
unforeseen obstacles or results.

The occurrence of one or more of the specified factors may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

**Risks related to the Acquisition**

**_Our inability to transition successfully to being a standalone company may have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation._**

We have historically been a part of the operations of AkzoNobel, which provided us with operational, financial,
and other support. As a result of the Transactions, we will become a standalone company and, accordingly, must
develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support our current and future business. We
cannot assure you that we will make the transition successfully. For example, historically, certain of our
accounting and information technology systems have been a part of AkzoNobel’s larger operations. There can be
no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, or other related issues resulting from the transition to a
standalone company and adjustments to associated business processes or that we will be able to fix any error or
issue. Any such errors or issues could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. Any delays in implementing required systems may lead to increased operating
expenses.

68


-----

The Transitional Services, which the Seller has agreed to provide to facilitate our ability to operate on a
standalone basis, cover such services as, among others, telecom, information technology, facilities management,
mail, sourcing, financial, accounting, human resource activities and data management. These services will
generally be provided for a minimum duration of six months, and will continue until terminated by AkzoNobel
upon six months’ notice, or by us upon three months’ notice. However, generally, if AkzoNobel terminates a
service prior to June 30, 2019, and after using commercially reasonable efforts we cannot replace such service,
then we will have the right extend services until June 30, 2019. The Transitional Services include certain IT
services which are provided pursuant to third-party vendor contracts. These services will require the vendor
consent to extend the term of the underlying agreement past the Closing Date, and thereafter will have to be
renegotiated with the IT vendor. We may not be able to successfully transition these systems to our standalone
operations in a timely manner, or at all, or may have underestimated the costs required to do so. Any delays in
implementing required functionalities and systems may lead to increased operating expenses.

We will also incur costs in the future that have historically been part of AkzoNobel’s larger cost structure,
including costs associated with health and welfare benefits for our employees, as well as internal legal, tax,
regulatory and treasury services. In particular, we will need to bear the cost of hiring additional employees,
including in the legal, finance, and human resources areas. We will incur costs searching for and hiring
individuals to fill the positions, and we may not be able to find qualified candidates at a reasonable cost, or at all.
Additionally, as part of AkzoNobel, we benefited from certain economies of scale, including with respect to our
relationships with our suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or build the independent
relationships that are necessary for us to continue to benefit from such economies of scale or operate our business
successfully.

Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs to operate as a standalone company will be consistent
on a forward-looking basis. Any failure to transition successfully within the terms of the applicable Transition
Services Agreements, or to otherwise transition successfully to a standalone company, may cause us to incur
substantial expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs, and would have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Further, becoming a standalone company will require a significant amount of management’s time and effort,
which may divert management’s attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or
all of the benefits that are expected from becoming a standalone company, or do not achieve them in the time
frame expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

**_Our current systems and the new systems and services that we will establish after the consummation of the_**
**_Transactions may fail to support our operations._**

In connection with the Transactions, we and AkzoNobel have entered into agreements by which AkzoNobel
provides certain Transitional Services to the Specialty Chemicals business until such time as the services are
terminated. See “The Transactions.” If we do not have the capacity to provide these services when they are
terminated, we may not be able to operate our business effectively. As discussed above, we have put into place or
we are in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties to provide, systems and services to replace
many of the systems and services that AkzoNobel has historically provided and currently provides to us.
However, we may not be successful in implementing these systems and services or in transitioning data from
AkzoNobel’s systems to ours, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

**_We may be unable to achieve some or all of the operational cost improvements and other benefits that we_**
**_expect to realize as a result of the Transactions._**

We believe that, after giving effect to the Transactions, we will be able to, among other matters, better focus our
financial and operational resources on our business, growth profile and strategic priorities, design and implement

69


-----

corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic priorities, streamline our
processes and infrastructure to focus on core strengths, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to
meet our specific needs, and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, we may not be able to
realize all of the cost savings we expect to achieve. Our Sponsors have estimated that we will be able to achieve
additional annual cost savings by pursuing a number of improvements identified during diligence and certain
other restructuring initiatives we plan to undertake. Our Sponsors cannot assure you that we will be able to
successfully realize the expected benefits of these initiatives or that the costs to achieve these cost savings will
not be higher than anticipated. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected
benefits. These risks include, among others, higher than expected standalone overhead expenses, delays in the
anticipated timing of activities related to such initiatives, increased difficulty, and cost in establishing ourselves
as a standalone company, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with
operating our business, inability to eliminate duplicative back-office overhead or redundant selling and general
and administrative functions and inability to avoid labor disruptions in connection with any integration of the
foregoing. Our ability to successfully manage organizational changes is important for our future business
success. In particular, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed if employee morale, engagement,
or productivity decline as a result of organizational or other changes.

Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance, and our estimated
cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as a
result, we cannot assure you that we will realize these cost savings. We expect to incur one-time restructuring
costs of approximately €46 million to achieve the annual cost savings we expect to realize in the next 24 months.
If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are less than our estimates, or our improvement initiatives adversely
affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove
inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.
These actions may not provide the expected benefits and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or
inability to recruit key personnel, decline in employee productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or
procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships.

**_We have not operated as a standalone company before, and the historical and pro forma financial information_**
**_presented in this offering memorandum is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have_**
**_achieved as a standalone company and may not be indicative of future results._**

The historical combined financial information we have included in this offering memorandum has been derived
from the historical accounting records of AkzoNobel and may not reflect what our results of operations, financial
position or cash flows would have been had we been a standalone company during the periods presented and may
not be indicative of what our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows will be in the future. As a
result, you will have limited information on which to evaluate our business and to make your investment
decision. This is primarily a result of the following factors:

   - as part of AkzoNobel, AkzoNobel provided us with certain limited services and allocated expenses for
those services to us in amounts that may not have been the same as the expenses we would have
incurred had we performed or acquired those services ourselves; and

   - our historical combined financial information does not reflect other events and changes that will occur
as a result of our separation from AkzoNobel, including the establishment of our capital structure, the
incurrence of debt and changes in our expenses as a result of our debt and new employee, tax, and other
structures and matters.

Because we historically operated within AkzoNobel, the historical Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of
the Specialty Chemicals business included in this offering memorandum have been prepared on a carve-out basis
from AkzoNobel, which required certain assumptions and estimates based on accounting data extracted from
accounting books that were used when preparing the combined financial statements of AkzoNobel. For additional
information about the past financial performance of our business and the basis of presentation of the consolidated

70


-----

financial statements see “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations”
and the audited and unaudited condensed combined financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

Other significant changes may occur in our cost structure, management, financing, and business operations as a
result of operating as a standalone company. Additionally, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA contained in this offering memorandum is not made in accordance with IFRS or with a view
towards compliance with published guidelines of the SEC. We cannot assure you that any anticipated cost
savings will be achieved or that our estimates and assumptions will prove to be accurate.

Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant costs we expect to incur in
order to achieve such cost savings, and there can be no assurance that such costs will not be materially higher
than presently contemplated. We expect to incur one-time restructuring costs of approximately €46 million to
achieve the annual cost savings we expect to realize in the next 24 months. If our cost savings are less than our
estimates or our cost savings initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement
than we project, or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our results will be lower than we anticipate. In
addition, our pro forma financial information does not reflect what our financial condition and results of
operations would have been as a standalone company and is not necessarily indicative of our future financial
condition or future results of operations. For example, the tax rate used in our pro forma financial information
will likely vary from the actual effective rate in periods subsequent to the Acquisition and any such variances
may be material. For additional information about the past financial performance of the business and the basis of
presentation of the historical combined financial statements of the Specialty Chemicals business and the
unaudited pro forma Condensed Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of our business, see “Unaudited pro
_forma condensed combined financial information,” “Selected historical financial information,” “Management’s_
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and the historical financial statements_
and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_AkzoNobel’s historical and future actions, or failure to comply with its indemnification obligations, may_**
**_materially affect our business and operating results._**

Although we will be a standalone company as a result of the Transactions, AkzoNobel’s historical and future
actions may still have a material impact on our business and operating results. In connection with the
Transactions, we have entered into certain agreements with AkzoNobel, including the Acquisition Agreement
and the Transitional Services Agreements. AkzoNobel’s failure to comply with any portion of the Transitional
Services Agreements, including any indemnities therein, for any reason could inhibit us from operating or
expanding our business in the future and/or result in significant additional costs to us. In addition, AkzoNobel
has, subject to certain exceptions, limitations, and exclusions, agreed to indemnify us under the Acquisition
Agreement for certain liabilities. We could incur material additional costs if AkzoNobel fails to meet its
obligations or if we otherwise are unable to recover costs associated with such liabilities.

For example, if AkzoNobel fails to provide necessary Transitional Services, we may not be able to operate our
business effectively until we are able to perform these services on our own, which may have a material impact on
our operating results during that time, and, if our inability to operate effectively impacts our ability to meet
customer expectations, we may have longer-lasting adverse effects on our business and financial results. See
“The Transactions.” Additionally, pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, AkzoNobel has agreed to indemnify
us for certain liabilities. However, third parties could also seek to hold us directly responsible for any of the
liabilities that AkzoNobel has agreed to retain, and there can be no assurance that the indemnity from AkzoNobel
will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that AkzoNobel will be able to fully
satisfy its indemnification obligations.

**_from AkzoNobel or its affiliates to us, or otherwise require the delivery of waivers, consents, approvals or_**
**_assignments by third parties, and any failure to renegotiate or obtain these waivers, consents, approvals, or_**
**_assignments, as applicable, could increase our expenses or otherwise reduce our profitability._**

The Acquisition Agreement provides that a number of contracts are to be assigned from AkzoNobel or its
affiliates to us or our affiliates. Certain of these contracts may require the counterparty’s consent to such an
assignment or will require us to renegotiate the contracts with such counterparty. It is possible that some of these
counterparties may not provide such consent or may use the consent requirement to seek more favorable
contractual terms from us. If we are unable to obtain relevant waivers, consents, approvals, or assignments, or
renegotiate the contracts, we may be unable to obtain some or all of the benefits, assets, and contractual
commitments that are intended to be allocated to us as part of the Acquisition. If we are unable to obtain these
waivers, consents, approvals, or assignments or renegotiate the same terms, the loss of these contracts or
renegotiation of their existing terms could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

**_After the Acquisition, certain of our executive officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of_**
**_interest because of their equity interests in AkzoNobel._**

Because of their former positions with AkzoNobel, certain of our expected executive officers and directors will
own AkzoNobel common stock. Even though our expected executive officers who are currently employees of
AkzoNobel will cease to be employees of AkzoNobel upon the separation, continuing ownership of AkzoNobel
common stock by our expected executive officers and some of our expected directors could create, or appear to
create, potential conflicts of interest if we and AkzoNobel pursue the same corporate opportunities or face
decisions that could have different implications for us and AkzoNobel. Potential conflicts of interest could also
arise if we enter into any new commercial arrangements with AkzoNobel in the future.

**_We may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed_**
**_assets._**

We expect to have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets as a result of the
Transactions. We are required to test goodwill and any other intangible asset with an indefinite life for possible
impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment.
We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are
indicators of a possible impairment.

There is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible
assets, and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the
markets in which we operate or impairment in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair
value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired.
An impairment charge would be recorded if the estimated fair value of the assets is lower than the carrying value
and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

**_Any change resulting from our operations as a standalone company, whether real or perceived may negatively_**
**_impact our customer and supplier relationships._**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, some of our customers, prospective customers, suppliers, or
other companies with whom we conduct business may prefer to work with larger companies or different
management teams. They may also need assurances that our financial stability on a standalone basis is sufficient
to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. Any failure of parties to be
satisfied with our management or financial credibility could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

**_The Sponsors will own the majority of our equity, and their interests may not be aligned with yours._**

After giving effect to the Transactions, the Sponsors will indirectly own the majority of the fully diluted equity of
Parent and, therefore, will have the power to control our affairs and policies. The Sponsors will also control, to a
large degree, the election of directors, the appointment of management, the entry into mergers, sales of
substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions. The directors so elected will have authority,
subject to the terms of our debt (including the Notes), to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase
programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. The interests of the Sponsors could conflict with your
interests. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the
interests of the Sponsors and certain of their affiliates as equity holders might conflict with your interests as a
holder of the Notes. The Sponsors may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings, or
other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investment, even though such transactions
might involve risks to you as a holder of the Notes. For example, the Sponsors may desire that we sell assets
pursuant to the “distributable asset sale” and other provisions of our new senior secured credit facilities and the
Indenture governing the Notes for the purpose of taking a dividend or distribution that would benefit the
Sponsors but would not benefit you as a holder of the Notes. Additionally, the Sponsors are in the business of
making investments in companies, and currently have and from time to time in the future may acquire, interests
in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or
customers of ours.

In addition, the Sponsors may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete, directly or
indirectly, with us. The Sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our
business and, as a result, these acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.

Additionally, investment funds advised by entities affiliated with the Sponsors may purchase Notes in this
offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this offering
memorandum. The purchase agreement among the Issuers and the initial purchasers will not restrict the ability of
the funds and the affiliates of the Sponsors to buy or sell the Notes in the future, and as a result, these investment
funds and affiliates of the Sponsors may buy or sell Notes in open market transactions at any time following the
consummation of this offering.

**Risks related to the Notes and our indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to raise_**
**_additional capital to fund our operations, and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes and_**
**_our other indebtedness._**

After this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, we will have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As a result of our substantial indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions, a
significant amount of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding
indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowings
available under the new revolving credit facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the Notes, or
to fund our other liquidity needs. As of June 30, 2018, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we

73


-----

would have had total indebtedness of €6,788 million, including €25 million of historical capital lease obligations,
€263 million of operating lease obligations that we are treating as capital lease obligations and debt for certain
purposes under the Indenture and including the Notes and borrowings under the new term loan facility, and we
would have had unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility available to us of €750 million.
After giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, our estimated cash interest expense for the LTM Period would
have been €380 million, based on the assumed weighted-average interest rate utilized in the “Unaudited pro
_forma condensed combined carve-out financial information.”_

Subject to the limits contained in the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities, the
Indenture and our other debt instruments, we may incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance
working capital, capital expenditures, investments, or acquisitions or for other purposes. If we do so, the risks
related to our high level of debt would further increase. Specifically, our high level of debt could have important
consequences to us and the holders of the Notes, including:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt;

   - limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures,
acquisitions, or other general corporate requirements;

   - requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of
other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and market conditions;

   - exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under the new senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete and
to changing business and economic conditions;

   - restricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;

   - impairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;

   - preventing us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the
occurrence of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event of
default under the Indenture;

   - placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors and affecting our ability to
compete; and

   - increasing our cost of borrowing.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service all of our indebtedness,_**
**_including the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness,_**
**_which may not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations, including the Notes, depends on
our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive
conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory, and other factors beyond our control. We might not
be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if
any, and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to
dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our

74


-----

indebtedness, including the Notes. As a standalone company, we will have a different credit profile than
AkzoNobel and we may not be able to obtain loans or other debt financings on commercially reasonable terms or
at all. Even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service
obligations. The credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities and the Indenture will restrict
our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to
raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. Because of these
restrictions, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient
to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business, financial position,
and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes. See “Management’s
_discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Financial condition, liquidity, and_
_capital resources.”_

Additionally, if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt we will be in default, and holders of the Notes
could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the new senior
secured credit facilities could terminate their commitments to loan additional money to us, the lenders could
foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. All
of these events could result in your losing all or a part of your investment in the Notes.

In addition, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries, some of which will not be
guarantors of the Notes or our other indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness, including the
Notes, is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash
available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Certain of our subsidiaries will not become guarantors
of the Notes. Unless they are guarantors of the Notes or our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any
obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose.
Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make
payments in respect of our indebtedness, including the Notes. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under
certain circumstances, legal, and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our
subsidiaries. While the Indenture and the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities will
limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or
make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the
event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal
and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_Each of the Issuers is a holding company with no operations and may not have access to sufficient cash to_**
**_make payments on the Notes._**

Each of the Issuers is a holding company and has limited direct operations. Their most significant assets are the
equity interests that they directly and indirectly hold in their subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon
dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our outstanding debt
service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law or the instruments governing our
indebtedness, including the Indenture, the agreements governing our new senior secured credit facilities or other
agreements of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to
make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. In addition, our subsidiaries are
separate and distinct legal entities and, except for our existing and future subsidiaries that will be the guarantors
of the Notes, any payments on dividends, distributions, loans, or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be
subject to legal and contractual restrictions on dividends. In addition, payments to us by our subsidiaries will be
contingent upon our subsidiaries’ earnings. Additionally, we may be limited in our ability to cause any future
joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us. Subject to certain qualifications, our subsidiaries are permitted
under the terms of our indebtedness, including the Indenture, to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict

75


-----

payments from those subsidiaries to us. We cannot assure you that agreements governing the current and future
indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit those subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient cash to fund
payments of principal, premiums, if any, and interest on the Notes when due.

**_We will need to repay or refinance borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities prior to maturity_**
**_of the Notes. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon us._**

We expect that the new term loan facilities and new revolving credit facility will mature in 2025 and 2024,
respectively, each of which is prior to the maturity of the Notes offered hereby. As of June 30, 2018, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had the U.S. dollar equivalent of
€3,325 million of term loan borrowings outstanding under the new dollar term loan facility, €1,790 million of
term loan borrowings outstanding under the new euro term loan facility and no anticipated borrowings
outstanding under the new revolving credit facility, with €750 million of availability. See “Use of proceeds,”
“Capitalization,” and “Description of new senior secured credit facilities.”

Consequently, prior to the maturity of the Notes, we will need to repay, refinance, replace, or otherwise extend
the maturity of the new senior secured credit facilities. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace, or extend will be
dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of
the financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay, refinance,
or replace indebtedness outstanding under the new senior secured credit facilities, we could be forced to
undertake alternate financings, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of the new senior secured credit
facilities or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay
indebtedness under the new senior secured credit facilities. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all.
Our failure to repay, refinance, replace, or otherwise extend the maturity of the new senior secured credit
facilities could result in an event of default under the Indenture and the new senior secured credit facilities, which
could lead to an acceleration or repayment of substantially all of our outstanding debt.

**_Despite our level of indebtedness after the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries may still incur substantially_**
**_more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above and impair our_**
**_ability to operate our business._**

We and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture and
the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities will contain restrictions on the incurrence
of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, including
with respect to our ability to incur additional senior secured debt. The additional indebtedness we may incur in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally
with the Notes, subject to collateral arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with you
(or, in the case of pari passu secured debt, senior to you, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness) in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or other winding up of our company. This could reduce the amount of proceeds paid to you. These
restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. In addition, as
of June 30, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the new revolving credit facility
would have provided for unused commitments of €750 million. Additionally, pursuant to the new senior secured
credit facilities we have the option to increase our new term loan facilities and/or our new revolving credit facility
or raise additional term loan facilities or revolving credit facility commitments by an amount not to exceed the
sum of (x) the greater of the U.S. dollar equivalent of €1,025 million and Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the credit agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities), (y) an unlimited amount so
long as on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of any such incremental loans or increase in our
new revolving credit facility commitments and/or our new term loan facilities (and after giving effect to any
acquisition consummated concurrently therewith and all other appropriate pro forma adjustment events and
calculated as if any increase in revolving credit facility commitments or any incremental revolving credit facility

76


-----

were fully drawn on the effective date thereof but without giving effect to the cash proceeds of such incremental
facility then being incurred), (a) for any such debt that is secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis with our
new senior secured credit facilities, the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis,
does not exceed either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection
with a permitted investment, the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such debt; (b) for any such debt that is secured by the collateral on a junior basis to our new senior secured credit
facilities, the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed
either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted
investment, the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt;
(c) for any such debt that is secured by assets that do not secure our new senior secured credit facilities, the
consolidated total net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50:1.00 or
(ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted investment, the
consolidated total net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt; and (d) for any such debt
that is unsecured, (x) the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed
either (i) 6.50:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted
investment, the consolidated total net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt or (y) the
fixed charge coverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, is not less than either (i) 2.00:1.00 or (ii) if any
such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted investment, the fixed charge
coverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt plus (z) an amount equal to all (i) voluntary
prepayments and repurchases of pari passu term loans borrowed under the credit agreement governing our new
senior secured credit facilities and (ii) voluntary prepayment of revolving loans borrowed under the credit agreement
governing our new senior secured credit facilities to the extent accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction
in the commitment therefor, subject to certain conditions. Such incremental facilities would be secured
indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase,
including the risk that we will be unable to repay the Notes. See “Description of new senior secured credit
_facilities” and “Description of Notes.”_

**_The terms of the Indenture and the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities will_**
**_impose restrictions that may limit our current and future operating flexibility, particularly our ability to_**
**_respond to changes in the economy or our industry or to take certain actions, which could harm our long-term_**
**_interests and may limit our ability to make payments on the Notes._**

The Indenture and the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities will contain a number
of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to
engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of
our subsidiaries to:

   - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

   - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;

   - make certain restricted payments and investments;

   - create or permit to exist certain liens;

   - transfer, lease, or sell certain assets;

   - merge or consolidate with other entities;

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

   - designate restricted and unrestricted subsidiaries;

   - prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain subordinated indebtedness; and

   - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities.

77


-----

As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:

   - limited in how we conduct our business;

   - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business
downturns; or

   - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategies.

With respect to the new revolving credit facility, we will also be required by a springing financial covenant to
maintain a maximum first lien net leverage ratio to be tested commencing with the third full fiscal quarter after
the Closing Date, at the end of any quarter when more than 35% of the new revolving credit facility (excluding
letters of credit (whether cash collateralized or not), any amounts drawn to fund certain original issuance
discount or upfront fees, and certain ordinary course ancillary facilities incurred under the revolving credit
facility, and further reduced by up to $100 million of cash on our balance sheet that is the result of certain equity
overfunding on the Closing Date, the proceeds of which have not otherwise been utilized to make distributions or
dividends) is utilized at such date. Our ability to meet the financial covenant could be affected by events beyond
our control.

A breach of the covenants under the Indenture or under the credit agreement governing the new senior secured
credit facilities could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured
or waived, may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other
debt that is subject to an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default
under the credit agreement governing the new senior secured credit facilities would permit the lenders under the
new senior secured credit facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the new senior
secured credit facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the new
senior secured credit facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. In
the event our lenders or holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries
may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations_**
**_to increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest
rate risk. Interest rates are currently at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, our debt service
obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed may remain the
same, and our profit and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will
correspondingly decrease. Assuming that the new revolving credit facility is undrawn (and to the extent that
(i) LIBOR is in excess of the 0.00% floor rate of the new dollar term loan facility and (ii) EURIBOR is in excess
of the 0.00% floor rate of the new euro term loan facility), each one-eighth percentage point change in interest
rates would result in a €6 million change in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under the new senior
secured credit facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating
for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, it is possible that we will not
maintain interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness. Alternatively, any swaps we
enter into may not fully or effectively mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_Claims of the senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to their security over the claims of_**
**_holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes will not be secured by any of our assets. As such, the Notes and each Notes guarantee will be
subordinated to any senior secured liabilities (including obligations with respect to the new senior secured credit

78


-----

facilities and any other indebtedness that is allowed to rank pari passu with such new senior secured credit
facilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In the event of any foreclosure,
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration, or other bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of the Issuers or any guarantor that has secured obligations (including obligations with respect to the
new senior secured credit facilities), holders of senior secured liabilities will have prior claims to the assets of
such entities that constitute their collateral, and the proceeds from the sale of assets securing any senior secured
liabilities will be available to repay obligations on the Notes only after all obligations under any senior secured
liabilities have been paid in full. As a result, holders of Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of senior
secured liabilities of the Issuers or relevant guarantor or if the holders of such senior secured indebtedness are not
paid in full, may not recover any amount at all.

In addition, in the case of a default or event of default under the new senior secured credit facilities and the
Indenture, holders of senior secured liabilities may be faster to make claims under the guarantees than the holders
of Notes. Since there is no intercreditor agreement, if the holders of senior secured liabilities accelerated and
made claims under the guarantees prior to the holders of Notes, the relevant guarantor could honor such claim
first and the claims by the holders of Notes would only be satisfied with any remaining funds. As a result, holders
of Notes may receive less than holders of senior secured liabilities or may not recover any amount at all.

As of June 30, 2018, on a pro forma basis to reflect the Transactions, we would have had an aggregate principal
amount of approximately €5,403 million of senior secured liabilities outstanding, consisting of borrowings under
the term loan facility, including €25 million of existing capital lease obligations and €263 million of estimated
capitalized lease obligations derived from our operating leases that will be treated as capitalized lease obligations
for certain purposes under the Indenture upon the application of IFRS 16 “Leases.” We also would have up to
€750 million available for additional borrowings under the new revolving credit facility. In addition, the
Indenture will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured
indebtedness.

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of all of our existing and future subsidiaries that_**
**_do not guarantee the Notes._**

After the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be guaranteed by certain of our existing and
subsequently acquired or organized subsidiaries that are obligors or guarantors under our new senior secured
credit facilities or certain capital markets debt, subject to certain exceptions. Our subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to
make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan, or other payment. The
Notes will be subordinated to our new senior secured credit facilities and structurally subordinated to all
indebtedness and other obligations of our Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries such that, in the event of insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution, or other winding up of any such Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, all of that
subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to payment in full out of that subsidiary’s
assets before we would be entitled to receive any dividend from that subsidiary.

For fiscal 2017, our subsidiaries that are anticipated to be Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries accounted for
approximately 25% of our revenues and 20% of our earnings before interest and taxes, before giving effect to
carve-out adjustments reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. As of December 31, 2017, our
subsidiaries anticipated to be Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries accounted for approximately 30% of our assets, before
giving effect to carve-out adjustments reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. On a pro
forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our Guarantor Subsidiaries will account for the substantial
majority of our liabilities, including the liabilities associated with the Notes and our new senior secured credit
facilities. Accordingly, our consolidated financial information may be of limited use in assessing the financial
position of the guarantors of the Notes.

79


-----

In addition, the Indenture will, subject to some limitations, permit Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to incur additional
indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on the amount of liabilities other than indebtedness, such as
trade payables, that may be incurred by these Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

Further, our subsidiaries that provide, or will provide, guarantees of the Notes may be released from those Notes
guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events. If any subsidiary’s Notes guarantee is released, no holder of the
Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be structurally
senior to the claim of any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

**_Guarantees to be granted by certain guarantors may not be in place at the Closing Date._**

In certain jurisdictions, primarily as a result of financial assistance “whitewash” procedures, local law,
constitutional documents, rules and regulations, and certain other practical limitations, certain of our non-U.S.
subsidiaries may not be able to grant guarantees of the Notes until after the Closing Date or at all. Such
guarantees may not be granted until such procedures have been completed or such other corporate or regulatory
approvals have been obtained in accordance with the applicable law in those jurisdictions. As a result, if there is
a default under the terms of the Notes prior to the date that such subsidiaries have entered into Notes guarantees,
the Notes may not be guaranteed by all anticipated guarantors. Additionally, the collateral agent under the new
senior secured credit facilities may grant extensions with respect to the addition of certain guarantors and,
therefore, because such entities would not be required to become guarantors in respect of the Notes until such
time as they become guarantors under the new senior secured credit facilities, there may be an extended period of
time after the Closing Date before all anticipated Guarantor Subsidiaries guarantee the Notes.

**_The lenders under the new senior secured credit facilities will have the discretion to release the guarantors_**
**_under the new senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those guarantors_**
**_to be released from their guarantees of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities remain outstanding, any Notes guarantee
may be released without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the Trustee under the Indenture, if
such guarantor is no longer a borrower or guarantor of obligations under the new senior secured credit facilities.
See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” The lenders under the new senior secured credit facilities will have the
discretion to release the guarantees under the new senior secured credit facilities in a variety of circumstances.
You will not have a claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a guarantor, and the indebtedness
and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will effectively
be senior to claims of holders of the Notes.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer and_**
**_we will not be required to purchase the Notes upon a Specified Change of Control Event._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the repurchase date.
Additionally, under the new senior secured credit facilities, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an
event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the credit agreement
governing the new senior secured credit facilities and terminate their commitments to lend. The source of funds
for any repurchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the new senior secured credit facilities would
be available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings,
sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because
we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of
control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due at such time. We may require additional financing
from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or
at all. If we fail to repurchase the Notes in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture. Further,

80


-----

the Issuers’ ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase
the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreement governing the new senior secured
credit facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial
to us.

In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations or the sale of our company to a
public company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a “change of
control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could increase the
level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings, or the value of the
Notes. Moreover, a change of control will be deemed not to have occurred if it constitutes a “Specified Change of
Control Event.” See “Description of Notes—Change of control” and “Description of Notes—Certain
_definitions—Specified Change of Control Event.”_

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset sale
offer, as defined under the Indenture, pursuant to which we will obligated to offer to purchase the applicable
notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See “Description of
_notes—Certain covenants—Asset sales.”_

The exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require us to repurchase the Notes pursuant to a change
of control offer or asset sale offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness,
including future agreements, even if the change of control or asset sale itself does not, due to the financial effect
of such repurchases on us. In the event a change of control offer or asset sale is required to be made at a time
when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such
prohibitions. If we do not obtain consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing
the Notes. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to pay cash
to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have_**
**_the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of change of control in the Indenture includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or substantially
all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law
and the judicial interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and circumstances.
Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a sale,
assignment, lease, conveyance, or other disposition of less than all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a
whole, to another person or group is uncertain. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to
repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_The Issuers may redeem your Notes at any time, which may adversely affect your return._**

As described under “Description of Notes—Optional redemption,” we have the right to redeem each series of
Notes in whole or in part beginning on, 2021, at the applicable redemption prices set forth in this
offering memorandum. At any time prior to, 2021, we may also redeem (1) up to 100% of each
series of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and
accrued interest and (2) up to 40% of each series of the Notes at a redemption price of 100% of the principal
amount plus the annual coupon on the applicable series of Notes and accrued interest using the proceeds of
certain equity offerings so long as the lesser of (i) 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the
applicable series of the Notes or (ii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes (in the case of the
Dollar Notes) or €300 million aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (in the case of the Euro Notes)
remains outstanding. We may choose to exercise this redemption right when prevailing interest rates are
relatively low. As a result, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at
an effective interest rate as high as that of the Notes.

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or the Dutch Co-Issuer_**
**_notifies the Escrow Agent that the Acquisition Agreement has terminated prior to the Outside Date, the Notes_**
**_will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect_**
**_on the Notes._**

This offering may close prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the initial purchasers will deposit the proceeds of this offering in
escrow accounts for the benefit of the holders of each series of Notes. The proceeds of the offering will be used
to fund, in part, the Acquisition. The Escrow Agent will release the escrowed funds to the Issuers at the time of
the consummation of the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum if the
condition described in this offering memorandum are satisfied.

If the Acquisition is not consummated on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum, upon
the earlier to occur of the Outside Date and the termination of the Acquisition Agreement, the Issuers will be
required to redeem all of the outstanding Notes of each series at a redemption price equal to (x) with respect to
the Dollar Notes, 100% of the applicable initial issue price thereof plus accrued interest from the issue date, to,
but not including, the date of such mandatory redemption and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100% of the
applicable initial issue price thereof plus accrued interest from the issue date, to, but not including, the date of
such mandatory redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the
redemption in an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price
greater than the issue price of the Notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently
believe that all conditions to the Acquisition will be satisfied and expect to consummate the Acquisition before
the deadline for the special mandatory redemption, we cannot assure you that the conditions will be satisfied or
waived, that we will in fact close the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this offering
memorandum, or that the Issuers will not otherwise have to redeem the Notes. Many of the conditions to the
closing of the Acquisition are not within our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be
satisfied. If for any reason we believe that the Acquisition will not close before the deadline for a special
mandatory redemption, we have the option to redeem the Notes earlier on the same terms. See “Description of
_Notes—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”_

The funds in the escrow account will be released and utilized as described in “The Transactions” and “Use of
_proceeds” upon delivering to the Escrow Agent an officer’s certificate stating that the condition to the release of_
the proceeds from escrow have been satisfied. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate
the Acquisition even if a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would have occurred had
the Issuers (after giving effect to the Acquisition) been subject to all of the provisions of the Indenture that will
govern the Notes as of the date of consummation of this offering).

**_Fraudulent transfer laws, and similar laws in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions, may permit a court to void the_**
**_Notes and/or the guarantees thereof and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws, and similar laws in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions, may apply to the
issuance of the Notes and/or the incurrence of the Notes guarantees. Under bankruptcy laws and fraudulent
transfer or conveyance laws and other similar laws in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions, which may vary from
state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Notes or the Notes guarantees could be voided as a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance if the Issuers or any or the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the Notes and/or incurred
the Notes guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the Notes and/or incurring the Notes
guarantees and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof:

   - the Issuers or the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the Notes guarantees;

82


-----

   - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the Notes guarantees left the Issuers or any of the
guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the
business;

   - the Issuers or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuers or such guarantor would,
incur debts beyond the Issuers’ or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or

   - the Issuers or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a
judgment for money damages docketed against the Issuers or the guarantor if, in either case, the
judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

As a general matter, under U.S. law, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer
or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A U.S. court would likely
find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its Notes guarantee to
the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of
the Notes.

We cannot be certain as to the standards a U.S. court or any other court would use to determine whether or not
the Issuers or the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses,
whether the Notes or any Notes guarantee would be subordinated to the Issuers’ or any of the guarantors’ other
debt. In general, however, a U.S. court would deem an entity insolvent if:

   - the sum of its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable
value of all of its assets;

   - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

   - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

Each Notes guarantee contains a provision intended to limit a guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it
could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its Notes guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer.
This provision may not be effective to protect the Notes guarantees from being voided under fraudulent transfer
law, or may reduce or eliminate the guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the Notes
guarantee worthless.

If a U.S. court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a Notes guarantee was a fraudulent
transfer or conveyance, the U.S. court could void the payment obligations under the Notes or that Notes
guarantee, could subordinate the Notes or that Notes guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of
the Issuers or of the related guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received
with respect to that Notes guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred,
you may not receive any repayment on the Notes. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or the Notes guarantees
could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in
acceleration of that debt.

Finally, as a court of equity, a U.S. bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the
Notes guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines
that (1) the holder of the Notes or the Notes guarantees engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the
inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of
the Notes, and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code.

Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, in general, applicable fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws,
equitable principles and insolvency laws and limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New
York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the guarantees. Courts may also, in certain
circumstances, avoid the guarantees where any guarantor is close to or in the vicinity of insolvency.

**_Each Note’s guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_**
**_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes guarantee shall provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant guarantor.
However, the Indenture will provide that each Guarantee will only cover those liabilities and will be limited to
the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant guarantor without rendering the relevant Notes
guarantee, as it relates to that guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective, unlawful or limited under applicable
law or causing the directors of such guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate or commercial law.
See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer.”

Enforcement of any of the Notes guarantees against any guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to
guarantors in the relevant jurisdiction. Although laws differ among these jurisdictions, these laws and defenses
generally include those that relate to corporate purpose or benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, financial assistance, preservation of share capital, thin
capitalization, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. Therefore, the Notes guarantees granted by each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries will be subject to any
applicable legal limitation and defenses, including as such limitation and defenses may be embodied in the
Indenture pursuant to so-called “limitation language.” Within the scope of applicability of such “limitation
language,” and if and to the extent one or more of the aforementioned laws and defenses are applicable, a
guarantor may have no liability at all or decreased liability under its Notes guarantee depending on the amounts
of its other obligations and applicable law and, to the extent payment has been made under a Notes guarantee,
may require that the recipient returns the payment to the relevant guarantor or insolvency administrator.
Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could further
limit the enforceability of any Notes guarantee against any Guarantor. For more information, see “Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer” and “Service of process and_
_enforcement of civil liabilities.”_

**_The Notes may not have the benefit of guarantees from guarantors incorporated in Sweden, and they will not_**
**_have the benefit of guarantees from guarantors incorporated in Denmark._**

The Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) limits the ability of entities incorporated in
Sweden to provide guarantees of indebtedness. The obligations and liabilities of a co-issuer incorporated in
Sweden will be limited and the Notes may not have the benefit of guarantees from guarantors incorporated in
Sweden. It is important that you read the disclosures and limitations described in “Sweden—Limitations on
_validity and enforceability of the guarantees and obligation as co-issuer—Sweden.”_

In Denmark, on the other hand, companies are generally prohibited from granting loans, guarantees or security in
connection with the financing or refinancing of the acquisition of their own shares or shares in their parent
companies and any such loan, guarantee or security will be invalid and unenforceable. As a consequence, the
guarantees will contain customary provisions limiting the guarantees granted by Danish companies, among
others, to the extent the guarantees would be in breach of financial assistance rules. As all proceeds of the Notes
are to be applied towards the financing of the Acquisition (and consequently the indirect acquisition of the
Danish Guarantors) and payment of fees and other costs related thereto, the Notes will not have the benefit of
guarantees from the Danish Guarantors.

There may also be certain local law considerations that limit the guarantees by the other Guarantors. See
_“—Each Note’s guarantee will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_laws or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Limitations on validity and_
_enforceability of the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer.”_

**_Insolvency laws of jurisdictions outside the United States may not be as favorable to you as the U.S._**
**_bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due under the Notes._**

The Dutch Co-Issuer is incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, the Swedish Co-Issuer is incorporated
under the laws of Sweden, the U.S. Co-Issuer is organized in the United States, the Guarantor Subsidiaries are
organized in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden, and are parties
to certain key agreements affecting your rights as holders of the Notes and your ability to recover under the
Notes, including the Indenture. The Notes may also be guaranteed in the future by other subsidiaries of ours
organized outside of the United States. The insolvency laws of these non-U.S. jurisdictions may not be as
favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may
be familiar, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to
obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceeding. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of
_the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer” for a description of the insolvency laws in the jurisdictions of the_
Guarantor Subsidiaries, which could limit holders of the Notes from recovering payments due under the Notes
and limit the enforceability of the Notes guarantees.

In the event that any one or more of the Issuers, the Guarantor Subsidiaries, any future guarantors, if any, or any
of our subsidiaries experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Guarantees provided by entities organized in jurisdictions not discussed in this offering
memorandum may also be subject to material limitations pursuant to their terms, by statute or otherwise. Any
enforcement of the guarantees or security after bankruptcy or an insolvency event in such other jurisdictions will
be subject to the insolvency laws of the relevant entity’s jurisdiction of organization or other jurisdictions. The
insolvency and other laws of each of these jurisdictions may be materially different from, or in conflict with,
each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, the ability to void preferential transfers, priority of
governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. The
application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, adversely affect a holder of the Notes’ ability to enforce its rights in these
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that such holder of the Notes may receive.

If the Dutch Co-Issuer becomes subject to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands (which currently include
bankruptcy (faillissement) proceedings or a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling)), under the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), Dutch law may, depending on the way the escrow has been structured,
prevent the trustee under the Indenture from using the escrowed funds to fund the special mandatory redemption.
If the escrowed funds are held in an account in the name of the Dutch Co-Issuer the court appointed bankruptcy
trustee adjudicating the bankruptcy proceedings or administrator adjudicating the suspension of payments will
argue that the escrowed funds are property of the debtor’s estate, despite the fact these were part of an escrow
arrangement. In that case, such bankruptcy trustee or administrator could use or authorize the use of these funds
by or on behalf of the debtor’s estate. Dutch bankruptcy law, however, allows secured creditors (like the trustee
under the Indenture) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the collateral (that secures their claims) as if
there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a stay of execution of a maximum of four
months may be declared by the bankruptcy judge. To the extent escrowed funds are used by the debtor’s estate
during this stay, despite the existence of security over such escrowed funds, the collateral over the escrow
account of the holders of the Notes will be dissipated and the holders of Notes could become unsecured creditors
of the debtor’s estate.

Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a bankruptcy trustee can require the holder of a security right in an asset which
forms part of the bankrupt estate to foreclose such security right within a reasonable period of time and, if such
holder fails to do so, the bankruptcy trustee may sell such assets himself in a manner provided for in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act. the secured creditor will retain his preference over the proceeds of such sale but will share in the
costs of the bankruptcy.

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Notes will be issued by a Dutch entity and a U.S. entity and on or after the Closing Date, a Swedish entity
will become a primary obligor of the Notes and the Notes will be guaranteed by the Guarantor Subsidiaries. The
Notes may also be guaranteed in the future by certain of our subsidiaries organized in other jurisdictions. In the
event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions or
in the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of a future guarantor. Your rights under the Notes and the
Notes guarantees could therefore be subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions, and you may not be able to
enforce effectively your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such
multi-jurisdictional proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial
uncertainty and delay in the enforcement of creditors’ rights. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, foreign
exchange and exchange control regulations, administration and other laws of the various jurisdictions may not be
as favorable to you as, and may be materially different from or in conflict with one another and those of, the
United States, including in respect of creditor’s rights, priority of creditors, registration requirements, the ability
to obtain post-petition interest or to collect in U.S. dollars or Euros and the duration of the insolvency
proceeding. The consequences of the multiple jurisdictions involved could trigger disputes over which
jurisdiction’s laws should apply, which could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect
payment in full under the Notes and the Notes guarantees. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the
_guarantees and obligations as co-issuer.”_

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the United States and non-U.S. courts against us, certain_**
**_of the guarantors or their respective directors, managers and executive officers._**

Certain of our directors, managers, and executive officers are, and will continue to be, non-residents of the
United States. In addition, the Dutch Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer, and certain of the guarantors are
organized outside the United States and most of the assets of these non-U.S. companies are located outside of the
United States. Although we will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any
action relating to the Indenture and/or the Notes, you may not be able to effect service of process on the non-U.S.
resident directors, managers, and officers in the United States or to enforce judgments of a U.S. court including
any such judgment predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States. Moreover, any judgment
obtained in the United States against the non-resident directors, managers, or executive officers, the Dutch
Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer, or any non-U.S. guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment
of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, may not be collectible in the United States. There is also
uncertainty about the enforceability of civil judgments in the courts of certain jurisdictions, whether or not
predicated upon the federal securities laws of the United States. See “Service of process and enforcement of civil
_liabilities.”_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension, or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not
reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein,
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension, or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the
future so warrant, such as adverse changes in our business. A negative change in or an indication of a possible
negative change in any of our ratings could have an adverse effect on the trading and market price of the Notes.
A suspension, reduction, or withdrawal at any time of any credit rating by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings, including the interest rate on
the new senior secured credit facilities, or result in higher borrowing costs. Any future lowering of our ratings
likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit

86


-----

rating initially assigned to the Notes is subsequently lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able
to resell your Notes without a substantial discount.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our_**
**_future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital._**

Upon the closing of the Acquisition, our debt, including the new senior secured credit facilities and the Notes,
will have a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as
adverse changes in our business, warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will
generally affect the market value of the Notes. Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell
the Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the potential effect of risks relating to the structure or
marketing of the Notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain
additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to the Notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell your Notes without a substantial discount.

**_Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will not be applicable during any period when the Notes are_**
**_rated investment grade by two of Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred_**
**_and is continuing._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will not apply during any period when the Notes are rated
investment grade by two of Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing under the Indenture. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur
debt and to enter into certain other transactions such as changes of control. We cannot assure you that the Notes
will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, the Notes will maintain such
ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain actions that would not have
been permitted while these covenants were in force, which actions may conflict with the interests of the holders
of the Notes. Furthermore, the effects of any such actions that we take while these covenants are not in force will
be permitted to remain in place even if the Notes are subsequently downgraded below investment grade and the
covenants are reinstated. Any subsequent lowering, suspension, or withdrawal of such ratings may have an
adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the Notes.

**_Certain jurisdictions may impose withholding taxes on payments under the Notes or Notes guarantees or_**
**_impose foreign exchange restrictions which may alter or reduce the amount recoverable by holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

Payments made under the Notes or Notes guarantees by the Issuers and the guarantors in certain jurisdictions
may be subject to withholding tax, the amount of which may vary depending on the residency of the recipient,
the availability of double-tax treaty relief and the recipient’s legal relationship with the relevant guarantor or
Issuer. In certain circumstances, holders of the Notes may be entitled to receive additional amounts in respect of
such withholding tax. See “Description of Notes—Withholding taxes.” In addition, government or central bank
approvals may be required in order for a guarantor organized under the laws of certain jurisdictions to convert
local currency into foreign currency to remit payments outside that jurisdiction under its guarantee. In addition,
foreign exchange controls applicable in certain jurisdictions may limit the amount of local currency that can be
converted into other currencies, including U.S. dollars, upon enforcement of a guarantee.

**_The Netherlands has announced its intention to introduce an interest withholding tax on intra-group_**
**_payments of interest to residents in a jurisdiction with a low statutory rate or a jurisdiction that is included in_**
**_the E.U. list of non-cooperative jurisdictions._**

Under current law, payments under the Notes are not subject to withholding tax in the Netherlands. In 2017, the
new Dutch coalition government announced its intention to introduce an interest withholding tax in respect of

87


-----

interest payments to ‘‘low tax jurisdictions’’ and in situations which are considered ‘‘abusive.’’ On February 23,
2018, the Dutch State Secretary of Finance published a letter addressing, among other matters, the previously
announced introduction of an interest withholding tax. An important clarification is that the new withholding tax
should only apply to intra-group payments. Payments of interest on, for instance, publicly-held listed securities
are therefore expected to fall outside of the scope of this new withholding tax. In certain circumstances, holders
of the Notes may be entitled to receive additional amounts in respect of such withholding tax. See “Description
_of Notes—Withholding taxes.”_

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the_**
**_Notes under U.S. federal or state securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the_**
**_Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes. The holders of the Notes
will not be entitled to require us to register the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or
resell the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk
of your investment for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer restrictions.” In addition, we will not be
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and holders of Notes will only be entitled to receive
the information about us specified in “Description of Notes—Certain covenants—Reports and other
_information,” including the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act._

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active_**
**_trading market may not develop for the Notes._**

The Notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We expect the Notes
to be eligible for trading by “qualified institutional buyers,” as defined under Rule 144A. We do not intend to list
the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or include the Dollar Notes in any automated quotation system.
Application has been made to list the Euro Notes on the LuxSE Securities Official List, without admission to
trading on one of the securities markets operated by the LuxSE. There are no assurances that the Euro Notes will
be listed on the LuxSE Securities Official List. The initial purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they
intend to make a market in the Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial
purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the Notes and, if commenced, may discontinue their marketmaking activities at any time without notice.

Therefore, an active market for the Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the
market price and liquidity of the Notes. In that case, the holders of the Notes may not be able to sell their Notes
at a particular time or at a favorable price, if at all. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of
the Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

   - the number of holders of Notes;

   - prevailing interest rates;

   - our operating performance and financial condition;

   - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and

   - the market for similar securities.

Even if an active trading market for the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will continue.
Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for the Notes may
experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the

prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes,
our performance, and other factors.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, therefore, will not be required to provide a_**
**_management report of our internal controls._**

Because we will not register the Notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be subject to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the
effectiveness of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Securities Act also requires public companies to have
and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the
effectiveness of those controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of
such internal controls). We will not be required to comply with these requirements and therefore we might not
have procedures comparable to public companies.

We do not currently have an internal audit function. Although we have devoted management and will implement
financial resources to develop and monitor our internal control over financial reporting, all internal controls
systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent limitations. In the course of our internal controls
evaluation, we seek to identify data errors or control problems and to confirm that appropriate corrective action,
including process improvements, are being undertaken. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities
are to monitor our internal controls over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in
this regard is that our internal controls over financial reporting will be maintained as dynamic systems that
change (including with improvements and correction) as conditions warrant. Even those systems determined to
be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and
presentation. Because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. We
cannot be certain that our internal control systems will be adequate or effective in preventing fraud or human
error in the future or that new deficiencies of a material nature will not evolve and which we may be unable to
correct. Any failure in the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could have a material
effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, which could negatively impair
our ability to execute our business strategy and have an adverse impact on the price of the Notes offered hereby.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered with_**
**_the SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were registering
this offering of the Notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering memorandum does not comply with SEC
requirements regarding the presentation of a ratio of earnings to fixed charges, does not contain certain executive
compensation information that would be required in a registered offering and adjusts financial measures that do
not comply with IFRS in a manner that may not be permitted in an SEC filing. See “—We may not achieve all of
_the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and_
_cannot assure you that our actual interest expense will not be materially higher than pro forma cash interest_
_expense as presented in this offering memorandum” and “Use of non-IFRS financial measures.” We urge you to_
consider this factor in connection with your evaluation of your investment in the Notes.

**_We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Pro_**
**_Forma Adjusted EBITDA and cannot assure you that our actual interest expense will not be materially higher_**
**_than pro forma cash interest expense as presented in this offering memorandum._**

We have made adjustments to EBITDA to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. These
adjustments reflect certain items related to our business strategy as well as the closing of the Transactions, and

89


-----

some or all of them may not comply with the SEC’s rules governing the use of non-IFRS financial measures. See
“Use of non-IFRS financial measures” and footnote 1 under “Summary—Summary historical combined carve-out
_and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data.”_

For example, in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we have added back, among other things, certain restructuring
costs and other unusual and/or non-recurring items, and will in the future add back acquisition-related costs. In
calculating our cash interest expense for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements presented in this offering memorandum, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest
rates that would apply to the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions. These adjustments are set forth
in “Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information.”

Our ability to realize the expected benefit or cost savings associated with the adjustments included or permitted
by the Indenture and the new senior secured credit facilities to be included when calculating Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs,
competitors and customers, delays in implementing initiatives, our ability to integrate businesses that we acquire
and general economic or market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in generating
growth, maintaining, or increasing our cash flows or profitability or achieving cost savings in connection with the
items reflected in these adjustments. In addition, the actual interest rates on the debt we will incur at the closing
of the Transactions may differ materially from the assumed interest rates we have used in preparing the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. We cannot assure you that Adjusted EBITDA or
Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA will reflect the actual benefit of the related adjustments or that our actual interest
expense will not be materially higher than interest expense shown in the unaudited pro forma condensed
combined financial statements presented in this offering memorandum.

**_Because each guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero or avoided or released under_**
**_certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the guarantors._**

It is anticipated that the Notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of certain of their subsidiaries. However,
the guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that the guarantors are permitted to guarantee under
applicable law. As a result, a guarantor’s liability under a guarantee could be reduced to zero depending on the
limitations and other requirements of applicable law and/or the amount of other obligations of such entity.
Further, under certain circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or
other applicable laws could void the obligations under a guarantee, or subordinate the guarantee to other
obligations of the guarantor. See “—Fraudulent transfer laws, and similar laws in applicable non-U.S.
_jurisdictions, may permit a court to void the Notes and/or the guarantees thereof and, if that occurs, you may not_
_receive any payments on the Notes,” and “—The Notes may not have the benefit of guarantees from guarantors_
_incorporated in Sweden, and they will not have the benefit of guarantees from guarantors incorporated in_
_Denmark.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain_
circumstances described under “Description of Notes—Guarantees.”

As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee, could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon
the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee
exceeds the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a creditor of an entity or
the insolvency administrator in the case of an insolvency of an entity may contest the validity and enforceability
of the guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or voided.

**_An investment in the Euro Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Euro entails significant risks._**

All payments of interest on and the principal of the Euro Notes and any redemption price for the Euro Notes will
be made in Euros. These risks include the risk that exchange rates may significantly change (including changes
due to devaluation of the Euro or revaluation of the holder’s currency) and the risk that authorities with

90


-----

jurisdiction over the holder’s currency may impose or modify exchange controls. An investment in the Euro
Notes by a purchaser whose home currency is not Euro entails significant risks.

These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic, financial, and political
events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. In the past, rates of exchange between Euro and
certain currencies have been highly volatile, and each holder should be aware that volatility may occur in the
future. Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily
indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of the Euro Notes. An appreciation in the
value of the holder’s currency relative to the Euro would decrease the holder’s currency-equivalent yield on the
Euro Notes, the holder’s currency-equivalent value of the principal payable on the Euro Notes and the holder’s
currency-equivalent market value of the Euro Notes, and, in certain circumstances, could result in a loss to the
holder. See “Exchange rate information.” Governments and monetary authorities may impose (as some have
done in the past) exchange controls that could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, holders
of the Euro Notes may receive less interest or principal than expected, or no interest or principal.

**_The Issuers cannot assure you that the procedures for book-entry interests to be implemented through_**
**_Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of your rights under the Euro Notes._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form are issued in exchange for global notes, owners of book-entry
interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Euro Notes except in the limited circumstances provided
in the indenture governing such Euro Notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its
nominee) will be the sole registered holder of the global notes representing the Euro Notes. After payment to the
common depositary, the Issuer will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal, or
other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest, you must rely
on the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in Euroclear or
Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder under the Indenture governing such Euro Notes. See “Book entry, delivery, and form.”

Unlike the holders of the Euro Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have the direct right to
act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers, or other actions from holders of the Euro Notes.
Instead, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream. There can be no assurance that procedures
implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any request actions on a
timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture governing the Euro Notes, if you own a
book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through Euroclear or Clearstream. We cannot assure you that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely
exercise of rights under the Euro Notes.

**_If we became subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the escrowed funds might be deemed to be property of the_**
**_bankruptcy estate, and the holders of the Notes might become unsecured creditors._**

If we commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case in the United States, or one is commenced against us, U.S.
bankruptcy law may prevent the trustee under the Indenture that will govern the Notes from using the escrowed
funds to fund the special mandatory redemption. The court adjudicating our bankruptcy or reorganization case
might find that the escrowed funds are property of the bankruptcy estate. If it makes such a determination, the
court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is
appointed, with or without restrictions. Although the Issuers have granted a first-priority lien on the escrowed
funds in favor of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, unless otherwise provided with protections in
connection with such use, the holders of the Notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate by
virtue of the Issuers utilizing the escrowed funds during the bankruptcy or reorganization case thereby dissipating

91


-----

the collateral of the holders of the Notes. Under applicable bankruptcy law, unsecured creditors, including the
holders of the Notes while the funds are held in escrow, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or disposing of a
debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval.

If the Dutch Co-Issuer becomes subject to insolvency proceedings in the Netherlands (which currently include
bankruptcy (faillissement) proceedings or a suspension of payments (surseance van betaling)), under the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), Dutch law may, depending on the way the escrow has been structured,
prevent the trustee under the Indenture from using the escrowed funds to fund the special mandatory redemption.
If the escrowed funds are held in an account in the name of the Dutch Co-Issuer the court appointed bankruptcy
trustee adjudicating the bankruptcy proceedings or administrator adjudicating the suspension of payments will
argue that the escrowed funds are property of the debtor’s estate, despite the fact these were part of an escrow
arrangement. In that case, such bankruptcy trustee or administrator could use or authorize the use of these funds
by or on behalf of the debtor’s estate. Dutch bankruptcy law, however, allows secured creditors (like the trustee
under the Indenture) to satisfy their claims by proceeding against the collateral (that secures their claims) as if
there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments. However, a stay of execution of a maximum of four
months may be declared by the bankruptcy judge. To the extent escrowed funds are used by the debtor’s estate
during this stay, despite the existence of security over such escrowed funds, the collateral over the escrow
account of the holders of the Notes will be dissipated and the holders of Notes could become unsecured creditors
of the debtor’s estate.

Under the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a bankruptcy trustee can require the holder of a security right in an asset which
forms part of the bankrupt estate to foreclose such security right within a reasonable period of time and, if such
holder fails to do so, the bankruptcy trustee may sell such assets himself in a manner provided for in the Dutch
Bankruptcy Act. the secured creditor will retain his preference over the proceeds of such sale but will share in the
costs of the bankruptcy.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be obligations only of the_**
**_Issuers_**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the proceeds of each series of Notes is
deposited into escrow, holders of the Notes will not have any recourse to the Specialty Chemicals Entities or any
subsidiaries of the Issuers as the Notes will be the obligations of the Issuers only. The Issuers do not conduct any
operations and have no material assets other than the escrowed proceeds. As a result, the sole recourse of the
holders prior to the consummation of the Acquisition will be to the funds deposited in the escrow accounts.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, between the time of the issuance of the_**
**_Notes and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to modify_**
**_or waive the terms or conditions of such document without the consent of the holders of the Notes._**

Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to
amendments or waivers of, or consents to departures or deviations from, the terms thereof and holders of the
Notes will not have the ability to veto any such actions. Although no such amendment, waiver or consent is
presently contemplated, if the parties to the Acquisition Agreement decide to make changes to the terms thereof
(including to the purchase price) or to waive conditions thereunder, the holders of the Notes will not be able to
prevent the release of the escrowed property to fund the Acquisition as a result of any such action and will not
have any veto or consent rights in respect of any such actions.

**The Transactions**

**Overview**

On March 27, 2018, the Dutch Co-Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Seller, pursuant to
which the Dutch Co-Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries will, directly or indirectly, acquire, through one or more
separate acquisitions, all of the equity interests of the Specialty Chemicals Entities. The Acquisition Agreement
provides that the total consideration to be paid for the Specialty Chemicals business consist of a cash purchase
price of €9,860 before certain purchase price adjustments, which will be determined pursuant to the Acquisition
Agreement. For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
_proceeds.”_

The purchase price will be financed through:

   - €3,380 million in cash, which will be contributed to us as common equity by the Sponsors;

   - our borrowings under our new term loan facilities; and

   - the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby.

The Specialty Chemicals business may make certain dividends and distributions to the Seller prior to the Closing
Date in connection with the Transactions, which could be material.

The Acquisition Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants with respect to the
conduct of the Specialty Chemicals business prior to the Closing Date and various closing conditions. In
addition, the Seller has agreed to take certain actions to facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis,
including, subject to certain exceptions, providing, among others, the following Transitional Services: (i) the
operation, maintenance, and support of the existing telecom network; (ii) certain building infrastructure and entry
logistics; (iii) server hosting and domain controllers in certain locations; (iv) certain mail services; (v) certain
technological services; (vi) internet services in certain locations; (vii) certain miscellaneous network
securitization services, monitoring, and firewalls; (viii) certain file exchanging services; and (ix) assistance
during network migrations. These Transitional Services are generally provided by AkzoNobel for a minimum
duration of six months, and continue until terminated by AkzoNobel upon six months’ notice, or by us upon three
months’ notice. However, generally, if AkzoNobel terminates a service prior to June 30, 2019, and after using
commercially reasonable efforts we cannot replace such service, then we will have the right to cause such service
to be extended until June 30, 2019. Certain IT services are provided pursuant to third-party vendor contracts,
which will require vendor consent to extend past the Closing Date, and thereafter will have to be renegotiated
with the IT vendor.

Further, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Seller has agreed that, for the three-year period following
the Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries will undertake in any capacity any research and development,
production, marketing, sale, or distribution of specialty chemicals worldwide, as carried on immediately prior to
January 1, 2018 (the “Effective Date”) solely by the Specialty Chemicals Entities (or as contemplated,
immediately prior to the Effective Date, solely by the Specialty Chemicals Entities, to be carried on by the
Specialty Chemicals Entities) or any activity which is of the same or similar type thereto and which is or is likely
to be in competition therewith. Similarly, subject to certain customary exceptions, the Dutch Co-Issuer has
agreed that, for the 3-year period following the Closing Date, neither it nor its subsidiaries will undertake in any
capacity any research and development, production, marketing, sale, or distribution of paints, and coatings
worldwide, as carried on immediately prior to the Effective Date (or contemplated, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, to be carried on) by Seller and its affiliates, excluding any activity carried on immediately prior to
the Effective Date (or contemplated, immediately prior to the Effective Date, to be carried on) by the Specialty
Chemicals Entities, or any activity which is of the same or similar type thereto and which is or is likely to be in
competition therewith. The Seller has also agreed that, for a one-year period following the Closing Date, it shall
not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not knowingly solicit for employment certain employees of the Specialty

93


-----

Chemicals Entities, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Dutch Co-Issuer has also agreed that, for a
one-year period following the Closing Date, it shall not, and shall cause its subsidiaries to not knowingly solicit
for employment certain employees of the Seller and its affiliates, subject to certain customary exceptions.

**Conditions to closing**

The closing of the Acquisition is subject to certain conditions, including:

   - the receipt of certain specified antitrust approvals in Brazil, Canada, China, the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Russia, South Africa,
South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States;

   - the required opinion of the Central Works Council of AkzoNobel has been received or the applicable
time period for delivery has passed; and

   - no court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, or entered
any order or law remaining in effect prohibiting the Acquisition and related transactions.

All notifications and filings with the relevant governmental authorities required to be made under the Acquisition
Agreement in connection with Acquisition have been made and the relevant approvals, consents or clearances in
connection therewith have been received as of the date hereof. Notice has been delivered to the Seller that such
approvals, consents and/or clearances have been received and the related condition to closing under the
Acquisition Agreement has been satisfied.

**Indemnification**

The right to bring claims for indemnification with respect to a breach of most representations and warranties
survives until the date that is 18 months after the Closing Date (other than claims with respect to representations
and warranties related to the equity interests acquired in connection with the Acquisition, which survive for 5
years).

AkzoNobel has, subject to certain exceptions and exclusions, agreed to indemnify us for certain losses, including
those associated with:

   - the breach of any representations and warranties made by the Seller in the Acquisition Agreement; and

   - claims in respect of certain designated U.K. pension liabilities.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, there are certain limitations on indemnification by the Seller for breach
of representations and warranties made by them, including:

   - indemnification for breaches of most representations and warranties is subject to a €10,000,000
minimum loss requirement per claim (or series of related claims); and

   - the Seller’s liability for breach of representations and warranties is subject to specific caps, amounting,
depending on the representations and warranties, to: (i) €1 for all representations and warranties other
than those related to the equity interests acquired in connection with the Acquisition, which are mostly
covered by a warranty and indemnity insurance policy providing coverage up to an aggregate liability
cap of €1,000,000,000, or (ii) 1% of the purchase price paid to Seller for the representations and
warranties related to the equity interests acquired in connection with the Acquisition.

The Dutch Co-Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Seller for losses associated with the breach of any
representations and warranties made by the Dutch Co-Issuer in the Acquisition Agreement.

**Ancillary agreements**

At or prior to the Closing Date, we and the Seller will enter into various ancillary agreements.

**Use of proceeds**

The following summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions. The
amounts set forth in the table and the accompanying footnotes will vary from actual amounts on the Closing Date
depending on several factors, including our estimate of purchase price adjustments, working capital, fees and
expenses, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Unless the Acquisition closes concurrently with this
offering, the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby will be deposited into an escrow account
and upon the release of the funds from the escrow account, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered
hereby will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition. You should read the following
together with the information included under the headings “The Transactions” and “Unaudited pro forma

(1) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into a new €750 million multi-currency senior secured revolving credit facility with a
6-year maturity. We do not expect to draw on our new revolving credit facility on the Closing Date other than a de minimis amount of
outstanding letters of credit expected to be issued under our new revolving credit facility. See “Description of new senior secured credit
_facilities.”_
(2) Represents the Euro-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of our new dollar term loan facility. See “Description of new senior

(3) Represents the Euro-equivalent of the Dollar Notes offered hereby.
(4) Represents expected equity contributions from the Sponsors, potential co-investors, and management. The amount of the equity
contributions from the Sponsors and certain of their co-investors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses (including any
financing costs) are greater or less than our current estimate of €345 million or if the purchase price adjustments under the Acquisition
Agreement are greater or less than our current estimate. See “The Transactions.”
(5) Represents the estimated total cash consideration for all the equity interests of the Specialty Chemicals Entities, net of estimated purchase
price adjustments pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement. The total cash consideration also includes the repayment or cash
collateralization of existing debt, including the Renminbi Facility, which we expect to occur after the Closing Date. The actual cash
consideration paid at closing may be higher or lower than our estimates. See “The Transactions.”
(6) Reflects the estimated cash on the balance sheet following the closing of the Acquisition (after giving effect to the anticipated repayment
or cash collateralization of the Renminbi Facility after the Closing Date), which may be greater or less than €300 million depending on
the actual cash on the balance sheet at closing and includes €100 million of cash expected to be funded by the Sponsors to help ensure a
seamless transition as we establish a standalone treasury function, which is permitted to be returned to the Sponsors after the Closing
Date pursuant to the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby. See “Description of Notes.”
(7) Consists of our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including placement fees, initial purchaser discounts,
underwriting, and other financing fees, our estimate of original issue discount, fees paid to the Sponsors, and other transaction costs for
advisory and professional fees. We expect to capitalize €168 million of the fees and expenses that we expect to incur in connection with
our new senior secured credit facilities and the Notes, with the remaining €177 million to be expensed when incurred. All fees, expenses,
and other costs are estimates and actual amounts may differ from those set forth in this offering memorandum.

(3) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes and does not reflect the initial purchasers’ discounts and

(4) Gives effect to the application of IFRS 16 “Leases” and therefore includes €263 million of additional estimated capitalized lease
obligations as of June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2018 we have not adopted IFRS 16 as this standard will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. We have estimated the potential impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 based on a preliminary
analysis of our historical lease payments. Our estimate includes significant simplifications and estimates. The effects of an actual
adoption of IFRS 16 at such earlier time may have differed from the effects presented here, including the application of different interest
rates, renewal periods, and other simplifications employed in our estimate. The actual amount of capitalized lease obligations may differ
from the estimate presented herein and such differences may be material. Under IFRS 16, lessees will recognize a lease liability (and
corresponding asset) for almost all lease contracts. A lease contract is the acquisition of a right to use an underlying asset and an
obligation to pay the purchase price in installments. The lessee recognizes the lease liability and the right-of-use asset initially at the
commencement date. At the commencement date, the lessee measures the lease liability at an amount equal to the present value of the
lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date. The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements and the unaudited pro
forma condensed financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum do not reflect this expected change. Certain

financial metrics under the Indenture are measured as if we have adopted IFRS 16. Also includes €25 million of historical capitalized
lease obligations before our adjustment for IFRS 16. Please see “Description of Notes—certain definitions—Fixed IFRS terms.”
(5) As adjusted total shareholders’ equity represents expected equity contributions from the Sponsors, potential co-investors and
management, less estimated transaction costs, net of taxes, we expect to expense on the Closing Date of the Transactions. The amount of
the equity contributions from the Sponsors and certain of its co-investors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses
(including any financing costs) are greater or less than our current estimate of €345 million or if the purchase price adjustments under the
Acquisition Agreement are greater or less than our current estimate. See “The Transactions.” See also “Unaudited pro forma condensed

**Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information**

The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial information of the Dutch Co-Issuer has been derived
from the financial statements of the Dutch Co-Issuer as of June 30, 2018 and for the period from March 19, 2018
(inception) to June 30, 2018 included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The combined audited financial statements of the Specialty Chemicals business for the year ended December 31,
2017 and the unaudited condensed combined financial statements as of June 30, 2018 and for the six-month
periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2018 are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The unaudited pro
forma condensed combined statements of operations have been adjusted to give effect to the Transactions as if
these events occurred on January 1, 2017. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been
adjusted to give effect to the Transactions as if these events occurred on June 30, 2018.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income (loss) data for the LTM Period have been
calculated by adding the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of income (loss) data for the
six-month period ended June 30, 2018 to the unaudited pro forma combined statement of income (loss) data for
the year ended December 31, 2017 and then subtracting the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement
of income (loss) data for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017.

The pro forma adjustments are based on the available information and certain assumptions that management
believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are
described in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is presented for illustrative and informative
purposes only and is not intended to represent what the results of operations or financial position of the Dutch
Co-Issuer would have been had the Transactions actually occurred on the dates indicated or reflect any dividends
or distributions that the Seller and the Sponsors may agree to prior to the closing of the Transactions. The
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of the Dutch Co-Issuer should be read in
conjunction with the information contained in “The Transactions,” “Selected historical financial information,”
“Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and our audited and
unaudited financial statements included elsewhere herein. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined
financial information also should not be considered representative of the future results of operations or financial
position of the Dutch Co-Issuer.

The Acquisition will be accounted for as an acquisition of the Specialty Chemicals business by the Dutch
Co-Issuer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to the underlying
tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the Specialty Chemicals Entities based on their
respective fair market value, with any excess purchase price allocated to goodwill. The pro forma purchase price
allocation was based on estimates of the fair market value of our tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as
described in notes (a) and (b) of the pro forma balance sheet adjustments in the accompanying notes to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information. As of the date of this offering memorandum, the
valuation studies necessary to determine the fair market value of the assets and liabilities to be acquired and the
related allocations of purchase price are preliminary and prepared based on preliminary forecasts, discount rates,
and limited publicly available information. A final determination of fair values will be based on the actual net
tangible and intangible assets that existed as of the Closing Date of the Transactions. The final purchase price
allocation will be based, in part, on third party appraisals and may be different than that reflected in the pro forma
purchase price allocation, and any differences may be material.

The historical financial statements described above have been adjusted in the pro forma financial statements to
give effect to events that are (1) directly attributable to the Transactions, (2) factually supportable, and (3) with
respect to the unaudited pro forma statements of operations, expected to have a continuing impact on the Dutch

Co-Issuer. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not reflect any
non-recurring charges directly related to the Transactions that have already been incurred or will be incurred
upon closing of the Transactions and also do not include any impact of the future adoption of IFRS 16 “Leases.”
These non-recurring charges are further described in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined financial information and include transaction-related costs (including fees payable to our
Sponsors). The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements.

(c) This adjustment reflects the annual management fee that we will pay to our Sponsors after the completion of

forma condensed combined statement of income (loss) for the twelve-month period ended December 31,

2017 and June 30, 2018. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2018, the annual management
fee included in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income (loss) was pro-rated to
€2 million. See “Certain relationships and related party transactions.”
(d) This adjustment reflects (1) the estimated interest expense on our new senior secured credit facilities and the
Notes issued hereby; (2) amortization expense related to the capitalized debt issuance costs (see note (d) to
the unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet); and (3) elimination of the historical interest expense as a
result of the repayment of the historical interest bearing debt. The pro forma interest expense has been
estimated at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6%. A one-eighth percent change in the
interest rate associated with our new senior secured credit facilities (assuming the new revolving credit
facility is undrawn) and the Notes issued hereby would result in additional annual interest expense (if the
interest rate increases) or a reduction (if the interest rate decreases) to annual interest expense of
approximately €8 million. Capitalized financing costs will be amortized based on the effective interest
method. A summary of the effects of the adjustments on interest expense follows:

(e) This adjustment reflects the tax effect of the pro forma adjustments described in notes (a) through (d) to the
unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of income (loss) above based on our estimated global
statutory tax rate of 25%. Because the tax rate used for these pro forma financial statements is an estimate, it
will likely vary from the actual effective rate in periods subsequent to the Acquisition and any such
variances may be material.

**Balance sheet adjustments**

(a) This adjustment reflects the estimated other identifiable intangible assets from the preliminary purchase
price allocation as of June 30, 2018 resulting from the Acquisition. A summary of the effects of the
preliminary purchase price allocation to the other identifiable intangible assets is as follows:

**Total intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** **€254** **€2,745** **€2,491**

The fair value and useful lives assigned to the identifiable intangible assets have been estimated based on
preliminary valuation studies utilizing discounted cash flow techniques and comparable market values for
similar transactions in the industry. The final purchase price allocation will be based on a complete appraisal
subsequent to the consummation of the Acquisition and may result in a materially different allocation for
intangible assets than that presented in this “Unaudited pro forma condensed financial information.” Any
change in the amount of the final purchase price allocated to amortizable, definite-lived intangible assets
could materially affect the amount of amortization expense.
(b) This adjustment reflects the estimated goodwill from the preliminary purchase price allocation as of
June 30, 2018 resulting from the Acquisition. For purposes of determining the purchase price allocation, the
fair market value of all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were estimated as of
June 30, 2018. Except for the specific fair value adjustments discussed in the notes to the “Unaudited pro
_forma condensed combined financial information,” we have assumed that our historical carrying value of_
assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflect fair value. The preliminary allocation of purchase price is as
follows:

Estimated total consideration . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . € 9,235

A summary of the effects of the preliminary purchase price allocation to goodwill is as follows:


**Historical net**
**book value**


**Estimated**
**fair value**


**Acquisition**
**accounting**
**adjustments**


Goodwill (1) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €515 €3,196 €2,681

(1) Historical net book value of intangible assets for the Specialty Chemicals business includes €515 million of goodwill that is being
eliminated through the preliminary purchase price allocation. Refer to note (a) for additional information on new intangible assets
recognized outside of goodwill.

(c) This adjustment reflects an increase in the recorded values of net property, plant, and equipment to its
estimated fair value of €4,222 million as part of the purchase price allocation based on the preliminary
valuation. The final purchase price allocation will be based on a complete appraisal subsequent to the
consummation of the Transactions and may result in a materially different allocation for net property, plant,
and equipment.
(d) This adjustment reflects an adjustment to record a deferred tax asset of €23 million which will be generated
from the €177 million of estimated transaction costs that we expect to incur as part of the Transactions and
that will not be capitalized, of which 50% is assumed to be deductible for tax purposes. The actual
transaction costs incurred at closing and the amount we actually capitalize may be different and that
difference could be material.
(e) This adjustment reflects an increase in inventory fair value based on the preliminary purchase price
allocation.
(f) Receivables and payables from related parties are eliminated in the post-acquisition financial statements
pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement.
(g) The following table illustrates the sources and use of cash in the Transactions, assuming they had occurred
on June 30, 2018:

**Sources (€ in millions)** **Amount** **Uses** **Amount**

(1) In connection with the Transactions, we will enter into a new €750 million multi-currency senior secured revolving credit facility with a
6-year maturity. We do not expect to draw on our new revolving credit facility on the Closing Date other than a de minimis amount of
outstanding letters of credit expected to be issued under our new revolving credit facility. See “Description of new senior secured credit
_facilities.”_
(2) Represents the Euro-equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of our new dollar term loan facility. See “Description of new senior
_secured credit facilities.”_
(3) Represents the Euro-equivalent of the Dollar Notes offered hereby.
(4) Represents expected equity contributions from the Sponsors, potential co-investors, and management. The amount of the equity
contributions from the Sponsors and certain of its co-investors may be increased or decreased if the fees and expenses (including any
financing costs) are greater or less than our current estimate of €345 million or if the purchase price adjustments under the Acquisition
Agreement are greater or less than our current estimate. See “The Transactions.”

-----

(5) Represents the estimated total cash consideration for all the equity interests of the Specialty Chemicals Entities, net of estimated purchase
price adjustments pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement. The total consideration also includes the repayment or cash collateralization of
existing debt, including the Renminbi Facility, which we expect to occur after the Closing Date. The actual cash consideration paid at
closing may be higher or lower than our estimates. See “The Transactions.”
(6) Reflects the estimated cash on the balance sheet following the closing of the Acquisition (after giving effect to the anticipated repayment
or cash collateralization of the Renminbi Facility after the Closing Date), which may be greater or less than €300 million depending on
the actual cash on the balance sheet at closing and includes €100 million of cash expected to be funded by the Sponsors to help ensure a
seamless transition as we establish a standalone treasury function, which is permitted to be returned to the Sponsors after the Closing
Date pursuant to the indenture governing the Notes offered hereby. See “Description of Notes.”
(7) Consists of our estimate of fees and expenses associated with the Transactions, including placement fees, initial purchaser discounts,
underwriting, and other financing fees, our estimate of original issue discount, fees paid to the Sponsors, and other transaction costs for
advisory and professional fees. We expect to capitalize €168 million of the fees and expenses that we expect to incur in connection with
our new senior secured credit facilities and the Notes, with the remaining €177 million to be expensed when incurred. All fees, expenses
and other costs are estimates and actual amounts may differ from those set forth in this offering memorandum.

(h) This adjustment reflects (1) the elimination of our historical equity, which will be replaced by our Sponsors’
equity contributions of €3,380 million as part of the Transactions, and (2) a reduction for estimated
non-recurring transaction costs of €154 million, which is net of tax of €23 million, which we expect to
expense on the Closing Date.
(i) This adjustment reflects an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of €950 million to account for the
difference between the revised book basis (i.e. fair value) of our tangible and intangible assets other than
goodwill and liabilities recorded under acquisition accounting and the carryover tax basis of those assets and
liabilities. The pro forma adjustment to deferred income taxes for the fair value step-up was based on an
estimated global statutory tax rate.
(j) The following table presents our estimated long-term debt outstanding following the completion of the
Transactions on a pro forma basis:

Pro forma current and non-current financial debt (1)
New term loan facility:
Euro term loan, long-term portion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €1,790

Total Debt (3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . €6,500

(1) Does not give effect to the capitalized finance costs and any debt discounts, as applicable.
(2) We expect our new revolving credit facility to be undrawn on the Closing Date other than a de minimis amount of outstanding letters of
credit expected to be issued under our new revolving credit facility.
(3) Excludes €25 million of existing capital lease liabilities that will continue after the Acquisition and estimated capitalized debt costs of
€168 million.

(k) This adjustment reflects an increase in current deferred tax liabilities to account for the difference between
the revised book basis (i.e. fair value) of our inventory recorded under acquisition accounting and the
carryover tax basis of our inventory. The pro forma adjustment to deferred income taxes for the fair value
step-up was based on an estimated global statutory tax rate.

**Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations**

_In this section, the terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” and the “Company” refer collectively to the historical_
_Specialty Chemicals business. Except where noted, the following discussion and analysis of financial condition_
_and results of operations discusses periods prior to the consummation of the Transactions. Accordingly, the_
_discussion and analysis of historical periods do not reflect the significant impact that the Transactions will have_
_on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows, including, without limitation, increased levels of_
_indebtedness and related interest expense and the impact of acquisition accounting (including changes in_
_depreciation and amortization). See “—The Transactions—Acquisition accounting” below._

_In addition, the statements in the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of_
_operations regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding the performance of our business and other_
_forward- looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the_
_risks and uncertainties described in “Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements,” “Use of_
_non-IFRS financial measures,” “Risk factors” and “Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial_
_information.” Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-_
_looking statements. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results_
_of operations together with the sections entitled “Glossary,” “Summary—Summary historical consolidated and_
_unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information and other data,” “Risk factors,” “The_
_Transactions,” “Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information,” “Selected historical_
_financial information” and the historical audited and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and_
_the related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum._

**Overview**

We are a leading global specialty chemicals manufacturer that provides essential chemistries for a diverse
portfolio of products, end-markets, customers, and geographies. We hold the #1 or #2 leadership position in
product lines that represent over 80% of our revenues. Our products are mission critical building blocks for
applications that serve diverse end-markets, including agriculture, cleaning, construction, food, fuels, oil and gas,
personal care, pharmaceuticals, plastic applications in automotive, and pulp and packaging. We expect our
end-markets to benefit from favorable long-term secular trends including agriculture intensification, automotive
light-weighting, energy efficiency in buildings, and demand for environmentally friendly products. We are
headquartered in the Netherlands, with sales in over 130 countries and key offices in Chicago, the Gothenburg
area (Sweden), and Shanghai. We have a 400-year history and function as a largely independent company within
AkzoNobel.

Our business is highly diversified, manufacturing approximately 10,000 discrete products across 21 different
product lines under the umbrella of five product families: Industrial Chemicals, Surface Chemistry, Pulp and
Performance Chemicals, Polymer Chemistry, and Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives. Each product family holds
leadership positions in key product lines and has a strong presence across the geographic regions in which it
operates. Our products are sold in well-structured markets where incumbents have sustainable competitive
advantages, including transportation limitations and the need for specialized know-how given production and
product handling complexity. Our stable cost structure and margins are in large part due to favorable raw
material pass-through dynamics. We also bolster our reliability of supply through various points of integration
within and across product families. For example, in our IC product family, we are fully backward integrated into
salt, and our ESD product family supplies ethylene oxide to our SC product family. Additionally, central
functional groups support each product family, allowing for shared best practices across the portfolio.

During the LTM Period, we generated revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €4,960 million and
€1,145 million, respectively, representing a 23% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin. Please refer to “Summary
_historical combined carve-out and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data,” “Unaudited pro_
_forma condensed combined financial information,” and “Use of non-IFRS financial measures” for more_
information on our historical financial performance.

**The Transactions**

On March 27, 2018, the Dutch Co-Issuer entered into the Acquisition Agreement with the Seller pursuant to
which Starfruit Finco B.V. will acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding equity interests of the
Specialty Chemicals Entities.

The Acquisition Agreement provides that the total consideration to be paid will be €9,860 million before certain
purchase price adjustments, which will be determined pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement. See “The
_Transactions” and “Use of proceeds.”_

**_Standalone company_**

Prior to the Transactions, we were a part of AkzoNobel. As a result, our historical results, as set forth in the
audited and unaudited condensed combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum, include an allocation of certain AkzoNobel corporate and shared services expenses. Specifically,
the Combined Statement of Income of the Specialty Chemicals business reflects income and expenses of the
Specialty Chemicals business combined with certain income and expenses from AkzoNobel directly attributed to
the Specialty Chemicals business. AkzoNobel corporate overhead services related to the Specialty Chemicals
business are included in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements based on specific identification and
activity levels or have been allocated based on allocation keys, if no specific activity levels were available. These
allocated operating expenses totaled €187 million, €225 million and €153 million for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and
fiscal 2015, respectively. Following the Internal Separation on January 1, 2018, such operating expenses are fully
reflected in the unaudited condensed combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018.

**_Cost savings initiatives_**

As a division of AkzoNobel, we implemented ALPS, an ongoing initiative to increase productivity and
performance across critical supply chain functions. ALPS has been highly successful and has resulted in
significant cost improvements and raw materials efficiency improvements from 2014 to 2017.

As a result of ALPS and other initiatives to be undertaken following the consummation of the Transactions, we
expect to achieve cost savings primarily through implementing improvements and generating efficiencies in our
sourcing and procurement, production, sales, and RD&I functions. Based on current estimates and assumptions,

113


-----

we expect to achieve annual savings of approximately €51 million within 24 months after completion of the
Transactions. These expected cost savings are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma combined financial
statements included in this offering memorandum but are reflected in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM
Period and are based on estimates and assumptions that we consider reasonable but are inherently uncertain.
These estimates are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, all
of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. As a result, we cannot assure you that
any such cost savings will be achieved. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Acquisition—We may be unable
_to achieve some or all of the operational cost improvements and other benefits that we expect to realize as a_
_result of the Transactions.”_

**_Acquisition accounting_**

As a result of the Transactions and the application of acquisition accounting, our assets and liabilities will be
adjusted to their estimated fair market values as of the Closing Date. We anticipate these adjusted valuations will
result in an increase in our future operating expenses due to the increased depreciation and amortization expense
related to the increased carrying value of our fixed assets and identifiable definite-lived intangible assets.
Additionally, the excess value of the total purchase price over the estimated fair value of our assets and liabilities
on the Closing Date will be allocated to goodwill. Any identifiable indefinite-lived assets, including goodwill,
will be subject to annual impairment testing. See “Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
_information” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Acquisition—We may need to recognize impairment_
_charges related to goodwill, identified assets, and fixed assets.”_

In arriving at the estimated fair values presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements, we have considered the preliminary appraisals of independent consultants, which were based on a
preliminary and limited review of forecasts and discount rates. We expect to complete the purchase price
allocation after considering the fair market value of Specialty Chemicals Entities, assets and liabilities at the level
of detail necessary to finalize the purchase price allocation. The preliminary estimated purchase price allocation
is subject to change for a number of reasons, including:

   - finalization of the fair value of working capital and other assets and liabilities on the opening balance
sheet;

   - the final identification and valuation of intangible assets; and

   - completion of appraisals of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

The final purchase price allocation will be adjusted based on the factors above and may differ materially from the
estimated allocation. See “The Transactions.”

**Key business drivers and trends**

_Global economic trends: Overall demand for specialty chemicals is closely aligned with GDP growth as it is_
exposed to a diverse set of geographies as well as end-markets including construction, automotive production,
and personal care. Our diversification helps enhance our resilience as well as positions us to benefit from high
growth markets.

_Secular industry trends: Our business is also impacted by secular industry trends, including:_

   - the growth in the demand for plastic applications, driven in part by light-weighting in the automotive
industry, increased use in developed markets, and focus on energy efficiency;

   - overall population growth, changing demographics, and changing consumer preferences, which are
driving increased product consumption and increased agricultural intensity; and

   - shifting competitive dynamics, primarily in response to regulatory changes in the industry (such as the
mandated shift from mercury to membrane technology for chlor-alkali production in the E.U.) or in

response to changing customer dynamics (such as the shift by pulp producers to production facilities in
South America).

_Raw material dynamics: Our business utilizes a wide variety of raw materials, some of which may exhibit price_
volatility from time to time. We mitigate the impact of such volatility through hedging and pricing pass-through,
which have historically allowed us to maintain strong margins.

Our revenues are also impacted by the following factors:

_Business interruptions_

Consistent with companies in our industry, from time to time we may experience certain interruptions to our
business that could impact our financial results. For example, in fiscal 2017, flooding by Hurricane Harvey
resulted in temporary site closures in Houston, Texas and an approximate $1 million impact on profitability due
to the interruption to production.

See “Risk factors—Risks related to our business—Disruptions in production at our third parties’ manufacturing
_facilities may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”_

_Acquisitions, divestments, and deconsolidations_

Our results of operations have historically been influenced by acquisitions, divestments and deconsolidations of
certain businesses. Our most notable example is the divestment of the paper chemicals business in May 2015.

_Foreign currency exchange rates_

While we report in Euros, we are engaged in an international business that operates in, and makes sales into, both
developed and emerging market countries with many different currencies. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015,
47.3%, 46.9%, and 46.2%, respectively, of our revenues were generated in Euros, 35.9%, 36.8%, and 37.1%,
respectively, of our revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars and 7.1%, 6.5%, and 6.4%, respectively, of our
revenues were denominated in Chinese Renminbi. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, 49.8% of our
revenues were denominated in Euros, 34.4% of our revenues were denominated in U.S. dollars and 7.5% of our
revenues were denominated in Chinese Renminbi. Accordingly, movements in foreign currency exchange rates
against the Euro, particularly the U.S. dollar, may result in an adverse change in the reported income or balance
sheet items from non-Euro operations.

In addition, our sourcing and manufacturing expenditures in a particular foreign currency may not match our
revenues in that foreign currency. We manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures through the natural
offset of foreign currency revenue and costs where possible. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we hedge our
exposure where our cost base currency does not match our revenue currency.

**Key components of our historical results of operations**

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is income generated by the sale of goods and services rendered, net of rebates, discounts, and similar
allowances and net of sales tax. Revenue generated from services rendered accounted for less than 1% of total
revenues for fiscal 2017.

For sales of goods, revenue is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the
customer, depending on the delivery conditions. Service revenue is generally recognized as services are rendered.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales includes all costs of materials purchased, cost of conversion, and other costs incurred in making
goods available for sale. These costs are comprised of variable expenses and fixed production costs, and are
capitalized in the valuation of inventory items. Once the sale of these items is realized, the costs capitalized in the
inventory items are reported as cost of sales.

Variable costs include the variable production costs directly related to a specific sales transaction, which include
but are not limited to the cost of raw materials, auxiliary materials, and energy.

Fixed production costs are the non-material-related cost components associated with finished products, including
production costs and stock adjustment. Production costs involve all indirect and overhead expenses of the
functions related to production, raw materials logistics and packaging materials, health, safety and environment,
and procurement incurred during the period. Stock adjustment relates to the direct fixed cost resulting from the
change in inventories, intermediates as well as finished products in order to allocate fixed production costs to
such products sold in the applicable period. The stock adjustment figure reflects the effect of capitalization of
production cost in stocks. In general, the stock adjustment is positive when inventories are increased and negative
when inventories are reduced.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses include variable selling expenses and selling and distribution costs.

Variable selling costs include freight costs and transport insurance premiums; commissions to agents; import
duties on exports; royalties to third parties on the basis of quantities sold or revenue amounts; and recycling costs
of packaging materials. If goods are sold to a distributor and re-sold to customers, any commission granted to the
distributor is deducted directly from revenue.

Selling and distribution costs relate to all of our revenue, marketing, and logistics expenses related to finished
goods which are not directly related to a specific transaction. These include all non-direct expenses associated
with: the sale of products, management of sales teams or customer accounts, internal support of the sales process,
management of non-direct channels, development of new sales with specific customers or groups, receipt and
administration of sales orders, market analysis, strategic market planning or development or advertising, logistics
related to the internal inter-site transfer of finished products, or materials and warehousing.

**_General and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses include headquarter functions that are not allocated to other functions, and
include finance, information management, human resources, legal group services, integrated supply chain
management services, facilities management, and others.

**_Research and development expenses_**

Research and development expenses include personnel and other costs related to research, development and
innovation functions and product safety and regulatory affairs. Research is defined as original and planned
investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific knowledge and understanding.

Development costs can be capitalized as an internally generated intangible asset, if it is probable that sufficient
future economic benefits will be generated by the development. All research costs are expensed immediately. If it
is not possible to distinguish expenditures incurred in the research phase from expenditures in the development
phase of a project, all the costs are expensed.

-----

**_Other results_**

Other results consist of material items of income and expense arising from circumstances outside the normal
course of business, such as acquisitions/divestments, realignment of strategy, impairments, and legal items.

**_Financing income and expenses_**

Our financing income and expenses include all earnings and costs that arise from financing our operations. The
most significant portion of financing income is incurred in connection with interest earned on bank accounts and
deposits. The most significant portion of financing expenses is incurred relating to post-retirement benefits and
interest in connection with borrowing funds.

Financing income and expenses are recognized in the combined statement of income using the effective interest
method.

**_Results from joint ventures_**

Results from joint ventures are recognized using the equity method based on the most recent financial statements
of the joint ventures.

**_Income tax_**

Income taxes include all domestic and foreign taxes and include: taxes on operating income less financing
charges, including non-recoverable withholding tax on dividends received from subsidiaries; and taxes on equity
in earnings and interest from entities in which we hold a minority interest and joint ventures, including
non-recoverable withholding tax on dividends received. Income taxes also include taxes, such as withholding
taxes, which are payable by a subsidiary, joint venture, or other entity in which we hold a minority interest on
distributions to the reporting entity.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €2,522 million compared to €2,549 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €27 million, or 1.1%. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased
5.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2017. This increase
was primarily due to better price and product mix benefits across our business, with all product families
benefiting from pass-through of raw material and freight price increases to our customers.

Revenue of Industrial Chemicals for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €685 million, compared to
€619 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €66 million, or 10.7%. On a constant
currency basis, revenue of IC increased 11.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher prices for caustic soda driven by supply
constraints. Volumes were flat due to minor supply chain disruptions in the chlor-alkali value chain.

Revenue of Surface Chemistry for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €503 million, compared to
€566 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €63 million, or 11.1%. On a constant
currency basis, revenue of SC decreased 2.5% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the
six-month period ended June 30, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to lower volumes, partially offset by
improved portfolio mix, as we focused on higher margin products.

Revenue of Pulp and Performance Chemicals for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €430 million,
compared to €470 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €40 million, or 8.5%. On a
constant currency basis, revenue of PPC increased 0.2% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 as
compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in as reported revenue is primarily due to
the termination of certain toll manufacturing agreements related to the divested paper chemicals business and the
impact of foreign currency fluctuations. This was decrease was partially offset by better volumes in performance
chemicals and bleaching chemicals in the Americas.

Revenue of Polymer Chemistry for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €381 million, compared to
€365 million for six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €16 million, or 4.4%. On a constant currency
basis, revenue of PC increased 11.3% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the sixmonth period ended June 30, 2017. This increase was primarily due to volume growth across all regions and
improved portfolio mix.

-----

Revenue of Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €576 million, compared
to €577 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €1 million, or 0.2%. On a constant
currency basis, revenue of ESD increased 7.0% for the six-month period ended June 30, 2018 as compared to the
six-month period ended June 30, 2017. This decrease in as reported revenue is primarily due to lower volumes
and foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by improved portfolio mix.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €1,693 million, compared to €1,682 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €11 million, or 0.7%. This increase was primarily due to higher raw
material prices and restructuring costs related to manufacturing network optimization projects, largely offset by
favorable foreign exchange movements and productivity improvements as a result of ALPS.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were €309 million, compared to €316 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €7 million, or 2.2%. This decrease was primarily due to favorable
foreign exchange movements, partially offset by higher freight costs.

**_General and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were €157 million, compared to
€188 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €31 million, or 16.5%. This decrease was
primarily due to efficiency savings in central overhead costs after the internal separation from AkzoNobel as well
as the reduced brand royalty charges from AkzoNobel, which decreased from 1.0% of revenue in fiscal 2017 to
0.5% of revenue in fiscal 2018.

**_Research and development expenses_**

Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were €50 million, compared to
€54 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €4 million, or 7.4%. This decrease was
primarily due to favorable foreign exchange movements and a one-time gain related to a real estate divestiture at
our research facilities in the Netherlands.

**_Other results_**

Other results for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were a loss of €19 million, compared to a gain of
€17 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €36 million, or 211.8%. This decrease is
primarily due to the positive impact related to the one-time settlement of a legal case in the six-month period
ended June 30, 2018 and higher separation-related costs in 2018.

**_Financing income and expenses_**

Financing expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were €17 million, compared to €9 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €8 million, or 88.9%. This increase was primarily due to interest
charges on the new short-term local third-party loan, expected to be repaid in connection with the transaction.

**_Results from joint ventures_**

Results from joint ventures for the six months ended June 30, 2018 were a gain of €2 million, compared to a gain
of €4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €2 million, or 50.0%. This decrease was
primarily due to lower results from our ethylene amines joint venture.

119


-----

**_Income tax_**

Income tax for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €76 million, compared to €84 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €8 million, or 9.5%. This decrease was primarily due to lower profit before
tax, and partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate from 26.2% for the six months ended June 30,
2017 to 27.2% for the six months ended June 30, 2018 mainly due to non-deductible separation related costs.

**Fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016**

Our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 are discussed below.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue for fiscal 2017 was €4,987 million compared to €4,784 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of
€203 million, or 4.2%. On a constant currency basis, revenue increased 5.2% for fiscal 2017 as compared to
fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to underlying volume growth and price and product mix
benefits across our business. This increase was partially offset by certain non-recurring events in the third quarter
of fiscal 2017, primarily Hurricane Harvey in the United States, the impact of temporary plant closures in China
relating to tighter wastewater regulations, and the force majeure of an ethylene supplier in Rotterdam.

Revenue of Industrial Chemicals for fiscal 2017 was €1,274 million, compared to €1,202 million for fiscal 2016,
an increase of €72 million, or 6.0%. On a constant currency basis, revenue of IC increased 6.1% for fiscal 2017
as compared to fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to volume growth due to strong operational
performance in the chlor-alkali and chloromethanes businesses, as well as increased market prices for caustic
soda. Despite the bi-annual major maintenance cycle at our Rotterdam, Netherlands facility, Industrial Chemicals
achieved high production volumes in chlor-alkali and salt, enabling it to capture higher market demand.

Revenue of Surface Chemistry for fiscal 2017 was €1,065 million, compared to €1,030 million for fiscal 2016, an
increase of €35 million, or 3.4%. On a constant currency basis, revenue of SC increased 4.6% for fiscal 2017 as
compared to fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to higher customer demand, particularly in the
oil and gas and organoclay markets, as well as in the fuels and lubes and cleaning markets, and increases from
passing through higher raw material prices to customers. These positive effects were partially offset by the loss
of volume as a result of the business interruption following Hurricane Harvey in the United States in fiscal 2017.

-----

Revenue of Pulp and Performance Chemicals for fiscal 2017 was €921 million, which remained stable compared
to €921 million for fiscal 2016. On a constant currency basis, revenues of PPC increased 0.3% for the fiscal 2017
as compared to the fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to volume growth across all markets,
offset by a decrease in average selling prices in the majority of the businesses due to unfavorable product and
regional sales mix developments and the termination of a manufacturing agreement.

Revenue of Polymer Chemistry for fiscal 2017 was €712 million, compared to €667 million for fiscal 2016, an
increase of €45 million, or 6.7%. On a constant currency basis, revenues of PC increased 8.1% for fiscal 2017 as
compared to fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to volume growth, partially due to the new
plant in Ningbo, China becoming fully operational in the first half of fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue was
also attributable to favorable prices in some markets as the competitive environment improved. These positive
developments were partly offset by production interruptions related to Hurricane Harvey and increased waste
water regulation in China affecting the Ningbo and Tianjin sites in China.

Revenue of Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives for fiscal 2017 was €1,111 million, compared to €1,051 million for
fiscal 2016, an increase of €60 million, or 5.7%. On a constant currency basis, revenues of ESD increased 7.7%
for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes and
prices, partially driven by the tighter supply-demand balance in ethylene amines.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales for fiscal 2017 was €3,319 million, compared to €3,151 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of
€168 million, or 5.3%. This increase was primarily due to increased volumes and higher raw material prices.
Fixed production costs remained broadly consistent as inflationary increases were offset by cost savings.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses for fiscal 2017 were €622 million, compared to €609 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of
€13 million, or 2.1%. This increase was primarily due to the increase in logistical and warehousing costs related
to higher sales volumes and temporary warehousing costs to bridge maintenance turnarounds.

**_General and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 were €376 million, compared to €371 million for fiscal
2016, an increase of €5 million, or 1.3%. This increase was primarily due to additional brand royalty costs,
partially offset by reduced information technology costs savings driven by ALPS.

**_Research and development expenses_**

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2017 were €106 million, compared to €105 million for fiscal 2016,
an increase of €1 million, or 1.0%. This increase was primarily due to increased research and development
activity.

**_Other results_**

Other results for fiscal 2017 were a gain of €18 million, compared to a gain of €23 million for fiscal 2016, a
decrease of €5 million, or 21.7%. This decrease was primarily due to a gain of €23 million realized in fiscal 2016
related to the divestment of a legacy site, as compared to a smaller gain realized in fiscal 2017 related to the
settlement of a legal claim.

**_Financing income and expenses_**

Financing expenses for fiscal 2017 were €13 million, compared to €15 million for fiscal 2016, a decrease of
€2 million, or 13.3%. This decrease was primarily due to a €4 million decrease in post-retirement benefits and a

121


-----

€5 million decrease in interest on provisions during fiscal 2017. These were partially offset by a €4 million
increase in interest on debt, resulting from higher interest expenses on outstanding invoices and VAT payables
and due to additional interest expenses a short-term local third-party loan.

**_Results from joint ventures_**

Results from joint ventures for fiscal 2017 were a gain of €7 million, compared to a gain of €25 million for fiscal
2016, a decrease of €18 million, or 72.0%. This decrease was primarily due to a €13 million gain on the
acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in EkO Peroxide LLC (“EkO Peroxide”) realized during fiscal 2016.

**_Income tax_**

Income tax for fiscal 2017 was €171 million, compared to €152 million for fiscal 2016, an increase of
€19 million, or 12.5%. This increase was primarily due to an increase of the effective tax rate, which increased
from 25.7% for fiscal 2016 to 29.6% for fiscal 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to adjustments for
previous years and for fiscal 2017 and also to (i) the impact of the U.S. tax rate change on the measurement of
deferred taxes, (ii) loss of the positive impact in fiscal 2016 resulting from incidental non-taxable gains related to
acquisitions and a divestment, and (iii) the impact of the innovation tax subsidy.

**Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015**

Our consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015 are discussed below.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue for fiscal 2016 was €4,784 million compared to €4,987 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of
€203 million, or 4.1%. On a constant currency basis, revenue decreased 2.9% for fiscal 2016 as compared to
fiscal 2015. Revenue was mainly impacted by price decreases as falling commodity prices were passed through
to customers. Our disposal of the paper chemicals business in May 2015 resulted in a €64 million reduction in
revenue for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. These negative impacts to revenue were partially offset by sales
volume increases.

Revenue of Industrial Chemicals for fiscal 2016 was €1,202 million, compared to €1,204 million for fiscal 2015,
a decrease of €2 million, or 0.2%. On a constant currency basis, revenues of IC increased 0.1% for fiscal 2016 as
compared to fiscal 2015. Revenue was essentially flat due to price declines from the pass-through of lower raw
materials prices to our customers, offset by volume growth across all markets.

122


-----

Revenue of Surface Chemistry for fiscal 2016 was €1,030 million, compared to €1,060 million for fiscal 2015, a
decrease of €30 million, or 2.8%. On a constant currency basis, revenues of SC decreased 1.6% for fiscal 2016 as
compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand for oil and gas related
surfactants due to a decline in oil prices. This was partially offset by an increase in other surfactants volume,
mainly driven by new business.

Revenue of Pulp and Performance Chemicals for fiscal 2016 was €921 million, compared to €989 million for
fiscal 2015, a decrease of €68 million, or 6.9%. On a constant currency basis, revenues of PPC decreased 5.5%
for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to the divestment of the
paper chemicals business, which had a €64 million impact. In addition, we saw volumes decline in North
America for our remaining business. This was partially offset by additional sales related to the acquisition of the
remaining 50% in the EkO Peroxide joint venture in fiscal 2016, which improved our portfolio mix.

Revenue of Polymer Chemistry for fiscal 2016 was €667 million, compared to €671 million for fiscal 2015, a
decrease of €4 million, or 0.6%. On a constant currency basis, revenue of PC increased 0.7% for fiscal 2016 as
compared to fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to increased volumes due to higher demand in
North America and new customer additions, partially offset by lower volumes sold by the plant in Tianjin, China
following a third party incident in the Tianjin area, the price impact of raw material price decreases, and market
pressure for metal alkyls products.

Revenue of Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives for fiscal 2016 was €1,051 million, compared to €1,151 million for
fiscal 2015, a decrease of €100 million, or 8.7%. On a constant currency basis, revenue of ESD decreased 6.7%
for fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a market-driven price
decline in ethylene amines.

**_Cost of sales_**

Cost of sales for fiscal 2016 was €3,151 million, compared to €3,416 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of
€265 million, or 7.8%. This decrease was primarily due to declining input prices and declining energy costs.

**_Selling expenses_**

Selling expenses for fiscal 2016 were €609 million, compared to €641 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of
€32 million, or 5.0%. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employees following the divestment of
our paper chemicals business in 2015 and a decrease in variable selling expenses related to lower revenue.

**_General and administrative expenses_**

General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 were €371 million, compared to €358 million for fiscal
2015, an increase of €13 million, or 3.6%. This increase was primarily due to an increased cost allocation related
to general management, corporate strategy, communications, finance, and general administration due to the
centralization of these functions at AkzoNobel.

**_Research and development expenses_**

Research and development expenses for fiscal 2016 were €105 million, compared to €98 million for fiscal 2015,
an increase of €7 million, or 7.1%. This increase was primarily due to increased research and development
activity.

**_Other results_**

Other results for fiscal 2016 were a gain of €23 million, compared to a gain of €25 million for fiscal 2015, a
decrease of €2 million, or 8.0%. This decrease was primarily due to a gain of €31 million realized in fiscal 2015

123


-----

related to the divestment of our paper chemicals business as compared to a gain of €23 million realized in 2016
related to the divestment of a legacy site.

**_Financing income and expenses_**

Financing expenses for fiscal 2016 was €15 million, compared to €16 million for fiscal 2015, a decrease of
€1 million, or 6.3%. This decrease was primarily due to lower financing expenses related to post-retirement
benefits.

**_Results from joint ventures_**

Results from joint ventures for fiscal 2016 were a gain of €25 million, compared to a gain of €6 million for fiscal
2015, an increase of €19 million. This increase was primarily due to a €13 million gain on the acquisition of the
remaining 50% of EkO Peroxide realized during fiscal 2016.

**_Income tax_**

Income tax for fiscal 2016 was €152 million, compared to €128 million for fiscal 2015, an increase of
€24 million, or 18.8%. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in pre-tax income. The effective tax
rate remained broadly consistent, decreasing from 25.8% for fiscal 2015 to 25.7% for fiscal 2016.

**Financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources**

**_Historical cash flows_**

Net cash from financing activities. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (481) (388) (244) (9) (48)

_Operating Activities_

Net cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €239 million, compared to
€206 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €33 million, or 16%. The increase in net
cash from operating activities primarily reflects the improved operational performance driven by price and
product mix benefits. The increase is also attributable to lower cash outflows related to provisions.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2017 was €696 million, compared to €717 million for fiscal
2016, a decrease of €21 million, or 2.9%. This decrease was driven by one-time cash outflows related to
remediation of certain environmental liabilities and the settlement of a legal claim, and partially offset by a
decrease in working capital.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2016 was €717 million, compared to €666 million for fiscal
2015, an increase of €51 million, or 7.7%. This increase was driven by higher profit for fiscal 2016 as compared
to fiscal 2015, and partially offset by an increase in working capital.

_Investing activities_

Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €160 million, compared to
€162 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, a decrease of €2 million, or 1%. This decrease was
primarily attributable to offsetting asset disposals.

124


-----

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2017 was €354 million, compared to €343 million for fiscal 2016,
an increase of €11 million, or 3.2%. This increase in cash used was primarily attributable to higher capital
expenditures and lower net cash proceeds from divestments.

Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2016 was €343 million, compared to €231 million for fiscal 2015,
an increase of €112 million, or 48.5%. This increase in cash used was primarily attributable to a lower net cash
proceeds from divestments of €29 million for fiscal 2016 compared to €127 million for fiscal 2015, which was
mainly driven by the divestiture of the paper chemicals business in fiscal 2015.

_Financing activities_

Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was €48 million, compared to
€9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, an increase of €39 million. This increase was primarily due to
partial repayment of a third party loan.

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2017 was €244 million, compared to €388 million for fiscal 2016,
a decrease of €144 million, or 37.1%. The decrease in cash used was primarily driven by increased cash proceeds
from our Renminbi Facility put in place to effectuate the legal separation from AkzoNobel, partially offset by an
increased cash distribution to AkzoNobel.

Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2016 was €388 million, compared to €481 million for fiscal 2015,
a decrease of €93 million, or 19.3%. This decrease in cash used was primarily due to lower cash distributions to
AkzoNobel compared to fiscal 2015.

**_Liquidity prior to the Transactions_**

Our historical liquidity requirements have principally been to fund our working capital requirements and capital
expenditures. We have historically funded these liquidity requirements primarily from cash generated by our
operations. During the historical periods presented, we utilized AkzoNobel’s centralized cash management
program and treasury functions, however, our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents were tracked on a
standalone basis. Accordingly, our consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows reflect cash and cash
equivalents directly attributable to us, and reflect certain external funding obtained from AkzoNobel and the
impact of consolidated income tax expenses, each of which will be inapplicable following the Closing Date.

**_Liquidity following the Transactions_**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, the Dutch Co-Issuer’s liquidity requirements will also include
servicing the €6,500 million of indebtedness it will incur on the Closing Date. The proceeds from this
indebtedness will be used to finance a portion of the estimated €9,235 million of total consideration that the
Issuers will pay in connection with the consummation of this Acquisition, see “Summary—Sources and uses.”
The Issuers do not expect to make any drawings on the €750 million new revolving credit facility on the Closing
Date other than a de minimis amount of outstanding letters of credit expected to be issued under our new
revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Dutch Co-Issuer’s cash
interest expense for the LTM Period would have been approximately €380 million. A one-eighth percent change
in the weighted average interest rate associated with the Notes and the senior secured credit facilities (assuming
the revolving credit facility remains undrawn) would result in a change in the Dutch Co-Issuer’s annual interest
expense of approximately €8 million, prior to the impact of any interest rate hedging it may undertake. In
addition, we intend to replace an existing line of credit for certain bank guarantees and letters of credit for trade
financing of certain of our operating companies with an incremental facility under our credit agreement that will
be secured and guaranteed equally and ratably with our new senior secured facilities. This existing line of credit
currently has approximately €30 million of issued letters of credit and bank guarantees and will have capacity for
issuance of up to €45 million of letters of credit and bank guarantees in the aggregate. This incremental facility is
expected to be established shortly after the consummation of the Transactions and prior to December 31, 2018.

125


-----

The Sponsors anticipate that the Dutch Co-Issuer’s cash flows from operations, cash on hand and availability
under the new revolving credit facility, along with the $100 million of cash expected to be funded by the
Sponsors that is permitted to be returned to the Sponsors after the Closing Date, will be sufficient to fund the
Dutch Co-Issuer’s liquidity requirements after the Closing Date. From time to time, we may establish new local
lines of credit or utilize existing local lines of credit. The Dutch Co-Issuer will manage its global cash balances
by utilizing available cash management strategies, which may include intercompany agreements, permitted
dividends and hedging. However, the Dutch Co-Issuer’s ability to service its indebtedness and to fund its other
liquidity requirements will depend on its ability to generate and access cash in the future. This is subject to
general economic, financial, contractual, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors, some of which
are beyond its control, as well as the factors described in “Risk factors.”

The Issuers or their affiliates may from time to time seek to repurchase or retire the Notes or term loans through
cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions, tender offers, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market
conditions, their liquidity, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

**Contractual obligations and commitments**

The following table presents a summary of the Dutch Co-Issuer’s significant contractual obligations as of
December 31, 2017, adjusted to give pro forma effect to the Transactions.

(1) Figures assume that our new senior secured credit facilities are repaid upon maturity, the Notes are repaid upon maturity, and the
revolving portion of our new senior secured credit facilities remains undrawn, which may or may not reflect future events. Future interest
payments include the fee on the unused availability under our new revolving credit facility, and are based on the assumed average
interest rate utilized in the “Unaudited condensed combined financial statements” for the new term loan and the Notes. Actual interest
payments and repayment amounts may change and such changes may be material.
(2) As described in “Certain relationships and related party transactions,” we expect to enter into one or more consulting services agreements
with our Sponsors in connection with the Transactions. Pursuant to this agreement, subject to certain conditions, we will pay the
Sponsors an annual management fee of €3 million.
(3) Does not reflect payments required to be made pursuant to the Corporate Brand License, the timing of which may be variable.

_Contingent liabilities_

Our contingent liabilities primarily comprise guarantees of third-party obligations, including indemnification
obligations under purchase and sale agreements, letters of credit, payment guarantees, down payment guarantees
and performance bonds, and other similar obligations in the ordinary course of business.

**Indemnifications**

In the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers,
vendors, lessors, business partners, subsidiaries, and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but
not limited to, losses arising out of our breach of agreements or representations and warranties made by us. We
have been the beneficiary of director and officer insurance maintained by AkzoNobel, which may cover certain

126


-----

liabilities arising from our obligation to indemnify Total’s directors and officers. It is not possible to determine
the aggregate maximum potential loss under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Such
indemnification agreements may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, we have not incurred
material costs as a result of obligations under these agreements and we have not accrued any liabilities related to
such indemnification obligations in our historical consolidated financial statements.

**Off-balance sheet arrangements**

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary
course of business.

**Significant Accounting Policies**

The preparation of the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements in compliance with IFRS requires the Group to
make judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The
estimates and assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The
most critical accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of
valuation and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results
than those recorded in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. These accounting policies relate to the
basis of preparation, income tax, impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, postretirement benefits and provisions. See “Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements—Note 3 Accounting
_policies” in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements for further background on each of these items._

**Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures**

Accounting pronouncements, which became effective for fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, had no material impact on
the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.

**Qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk**

**_Overview_**

Our business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets, including interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. We may in the future utilize derivative financial instruments (including
LIBOR swap arrangements), among other methods, to hedge some of these exposures. We do not use derivative
financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

**_Interest rate risk_**

We will be subject to interest rate market risk in connection with our long-term debt. Our principal interest rate
exposure will relate to variable rate borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities. The new senior
secured credit facilities are comprised of our €5,115 million new term loan facilities, which will be funded on the
Closing Date, and our €750 million new revolving credit facility, which we expect to remain undrawn on the
Closing Date other than a de minimis amount of outstanding letters of credit expected to be issued under our new
revolving credit facility. To the extent that EURIBOR and LIBOR are in excess of the 0.00% floor rate of the
term loan facility, each one-eighth point change in interest rates would result in approximately a €6 million
change in annual interest expense on the funded indebtedness under the new senior secured credit facilities,
assuming the RCF remains undrawn.

**_Foreign currency exchange rate risk_**

Due to our international operations, our results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
including those related to Euros, U.S. dollars, Swedish Krona, and Chinese renminbi. As a result, significant

127


-----

fluctuations in these currencies may have an impact on our results of operations in any particular period. See
“Risk factors—Risks related to our business—We are exposed to the movement of foreign currency exchange
_rates, predominantly versus the Euro.” When considered appropriate, we may enter into derivatives to hedge_
foreign currency exchange risk arising from specific transactions.

**_Energy and Commodity Price Risk_**

We purchase significant amounts of energy to supply the energy required in our production processes for our
products in each of our product families. We purchase approximately eight TWh of natural gas in a given year.
Our purchase agreements with our customers typically provide for the pass through of natural gas or oil price
increases; however, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to pass through future price increases
without loss of existing customers. Furthermore, we have diversified our exposure across energy commodities,
including electricity and waste. Finally, where we are unable to employ a natural hedge and sufficiently reduce
our exposure, we hedge our short positions on the respective energy future markets, primarily through the use of
forward contracts. In practice, we typically hedge electricity and rely on natural hedges with respect to gas and
biomass.

We are exposed to price risks on raw material purchases, most significantly related to upstream petrochemical
commodities including ethylene and methanol and their derivatives and natural oils and fats and their derivative
fatty acids. We respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw materials purchases and
through commercial and contractual pricing agreements and customer price adjustments. For our commodity raw
materials, we have purchase contracts that have periodic price adjustment provisions. Commitments with certain
suppliers, provide up to 100% of our estimated requirements but also provide us with the flexibility to purchase a
certain portion of our needs in the spot market, when it is favorable to us. See “Risk factors—Risks related to our
_business—Price volatility or interruptions in our supply of chemicals and raw materials may have a material_
_adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.” and “Risk factors—Risks related_
_to our business—We depend on certain key suppliers and the termination of the underlying contracts and_
_delivery failures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of_
_operations.”_

Our commodity risk is moderated through our selected use of customer contracts with selling price provisions
that are indexed to publicly available indices for the relevant commodity raw materials.

**Business**

**Our company**

We are a leading global specialty chemicals manufacturer that provides essential chemistries for a diverse
portfolio of products, end-markets, customers, and geographies. We hold the #1 or #2 leadership position in
product lines that represent over 80% of our revenues. Our products are mission critical building blocks for
applications that serve diverse end-markets, including agriculture, cleaning, construction, food, fuels, oil and gas,
personal care, pharmaceuticals, plastic applications in automotive, and pulp and packaging. We expect our
end-markets to benefit from favorable long-term secular trends including agriculture intensification, automotive
light-weighting, energy efficiency in buildings, and demand for environmentally friendly products. We are
headquartered in the Netherlands, with sales in over 130 countries and key offices in Chicago, the Gothenburg
area (Sweden), and Shanghai. We have a 400-year history and function as a largely independent company within
AkzoNobel.

Our business is highly diversified, manufacturing approximately 10,000 discrete products across 21 different
product lines under the umbrella of five product families: Industrial Chemicals, Surface Chemistry, Pulp and
Performance Chemicals, Polymer Chemistry, and Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives. Each product family holds
leadership positions in key product lines and has a strong presence across the geographic regions in which it
operates. Our products are sold in well-structured markets where incumbents have sustainable competitive
advantages, including transportation limitations and the need for specialized know-how given production and
product handling complexity. Our stable cost structure and margins are in large part due to favorable raw
material pass-through dynamics. We also bolster our reliability of supply through various points of integration
within and across product families. For example, in our IC product family, we are fully backward integrated into
salt, and our ESD product family supplies ethylene oxide to our SC product family. Additionally, central
functional groups support each product family, allowing for shared best practices across the portfolio. These
central functional groups are primarily focused on optimizing our supply chain; health, safety, and environment
excellence; RD&I; sales and marketing; and other administrative functions.

Over our 400-year history, we have combined our ability to innovate and master complex chemical production
processes with our world-class manufacturing network to develop bespoke, value-add solutions for our
customers, resulting in our attractive long-term growth and strong margins. We are well-known within the
industry for our technology leadership, chemical expertise, and reliability in serving our customers. We have a
customer-focused Research, Development & Innovation (“RD&I”) approach, often partnering with our
customers to develop specifically tailored products and solutions to meet their unique needs. We hold more than
5,000 active patents and operate 20 RD&I centers across three continents with over 700 dedicated employees.

129


-----

We have invested approximately €100 million annually in RD&I in each of the past three years. We currently
have over 200 active RD&I projects and launch approximately 40 new or improved products and processes every
year. As a result of our focus on and investment in innovation, we have increased our share of revenue derived
from recently introduced products and processes from 8% in 2013 to 12% in 2017. Compared to the rest of our
portfolio, these sales generally capture higher margins and higher growth, and therefore provide incremental
upside to our already strong core business. Our RD&I investments also include internal initiatives focusing on
improving our production processes. This enables us to protect our cost base against inflation and reduce
production costs, strengthening our margins.

We have a well-invested global manufacturing footprint with 103 plants on 67 sites across four continents,
situated in close proximity to our end-markets and customers. Our customers are supported by over 9,700
employees who work to ensure customer needs are met. Our employees are also focused on safety and regulatory
compliance, which are critical components of our value proposition. We have a global reputation for safety with
a strong track record in handling and transporting hazardous products, including organic peroxides, chlorine
dioxide, sulfuric acid, and chlorine. We are recognized within the industry for our excellence in occupational
safety performance and we also offer safety training to our customers. Our technological know-how, reliability,
safety, manufacturing scale, and proximity to customers have resulted in strong relationships and loyalty, as
evidenced by an average customer relationship length of over 20 years for our top 100 customers and over 98%
retention year-over-year among our top 250 customers.

During the LTM Period, we generated revenue and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €4,960 million and €1,145
million, respectively, representing a 23% Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA margin. Please refer to “Summary
_historical combined carve-out and unaudited pro forma financial information and other data,” “Unaudited pro_
_forma condensed combined financial information,” and “Use of non-IFRS financial measures” for more_

We operate in well-structured markets with over 80% of our revenues generated by product lines serving markets
in which the top three competitors hold more than a 50% share. We are exposed to a broad range of end-markets
including agriculture, consumer goods, cleaning, construction, food, fuels and lubes, oil and gas, personal care,
pharmaceuticals, and pulp and packaging, which are each expected to grow at a CAGR in the range of
approximately 2.0% to 4.0% from 2017 through 2022. These positive long-term growth rates are driven by
favorable secular trends including agriculture intensification, automotive light-weighting, energy efficiency in
buildings, and demand for environmentally friendly products.

**_Diversified revenue base by products, end-markets, customers, and geographies_**

We benefit from a broad product portfolio comprised of approximately 10,000 discrete products organized into
21 product lines and five product families. For example, surfactants, which is our largest product line, represents
approximately 16% of LTM Period revenues, but is comprised of over 1,000 discrete products used in 11
different end-markets.

Similarly, across all of our product families, we are exposed to a broad range of end-markets such as agriculture,
consumer goods, cleaning, construction, food, fuels and lubes, oil and gas, personal care, pharmaceuticals, and
pulp and packaging. Our end-markets have different growth drivers and secular trends, with varying degrees of
exposure to general economic conditions.

Polysulfides, CMC, and Separation Products.
(2) “Other” consists of end-markets comprising less than 5% of the Company’s revenues, including electronics.

We sell to over 12,000 customers globally in over 130 countries. Our top 20 customers accounted for
approximately 23% of revenue in the LTM Period, with no one customer accounting for more than 3% of
revenues. Our global footprint allows us to serve our customers around the world, and during the LTM Period we
generated 48% of our revenue in Europe (approximately half of which is generated by sales into Germany, the
Netherlands, and Sweden), 22% in North America, 17% in Asia, 10% in South America, and the remaining 3%
in other regions.

As a result of these diversifications, we are naturally insulated against movements in any one product,
end-market, customer, or geography to which we are exposed.

**_Global scale and well-invested asset footprint_**

We manufacture essential chemistries in approximately 20 countries and have a well-invested global asset base
with 103 plants on 67 sites, enabling us to serve global customers across many geographies.

132


-----

Approximately 70% of our production assets are located in developed markets with the rest in emerging markets,
allowing us to capture high growth opportunities. Our global reach is critical for customers that need a reliable
supply chain across geographies, such as our large customers in the consumer packaged goods end-markets that
utilize surfactants. Many of our manufacturing processes have high start-up capital requirements, and long leadtimes are required for both greenfield and brownfield projects. For example, building a greenfield chlor-alkali
plant typically takes at least three years, costs a minimum of €200 million, and requires significant permitting.
New entrants would need significant capital and time to replicate our footprint.

We have also invested a significant amount of capital and resources to position us for future growth and ensure
that our business remains compliant with changing global regulations. For example, in Europe we have been a
leader in the shift from mercury to membrane technology for chlor-alkali production in response to stringent new
E.U. environmental regulations that have mandated the complete phase out of the mercury process. Our ability to
act quickly in response to regulatory changes and our strong relationships with regulators are particularly
important given the highly regulated nature of many of our products, and we have demonstrated excellence in
anticipating and responding to regulatory changes around the world. As a result of our global position, we have
been able to maintain and grow our leading market positions.

**_Sustainable competitive advantage driven by technology leadership, value-add innovation, and customer_**
**_intimacy_**

Our technology leadership is supported by 20 RD&I centers, more than 5,000 active patents, as well as the
technical know-how required to execute our complex multi-step processes. To stay on the cutting edge of
development and innovation for specialty chemicals, we have invested approximately €100 million annually in
RD&I in each of the past three years, helping us maintain and grow our leadership positions across all product
families. We currently have over 200 active RD&I projects and we launch approximately 40 new or improved
products and processes every year. Our product innovation is largely customer driven, and results in technical
reliance and sticky customer relationships. For example, surfactants customers rely on us for tailor-made

133


-----

products and solutions, with approximately 45% of our SC revenue in fiscal 2016 derived from uniquely
formulated products and customized chemistries for individual customers. Further supporting our incumbency,
our customers often face a long internal certification process to switch suppliers.

Our deep understanding of our customers’ requirements and applications, as well as our customer proximity,
have resulted in strong relationships and a high degree of intimacy. For many of our large, high-volume chemical
products, including chlor-alkali, sodium chlorate, and industrial salt, we are either physically connected to our
customers via pipeline, co-located, or regionally located to provide differentiated service and reliability of
supply. For example, in our sodium chlorate business, we utilize innovative Chemical Islands to supply key
captive customer plants via pipelines; in chlor-alkali, our plants are frequently situated in networks of customers,
to which we provide chlorine via pipeline; and certain types of organic peroxides require refrigeration at
temperatures below negative 20 degrees Celsius, thereby reducing the distance which they can be economically
transported. Our proximity and customer intimacy is important when managing products with limited
transportability and complex handling needs, and is difficult for new entrants to replicate. The strength of our
position with our customers is evidenced by an average customer relationship length of over 20 years for our top
100 customers and over 98% retention year-over-year among our top 250 customers.

**_Well-diversified feedstock base with favorable raw material pass-through mechanics_**

We benefit from a highly diversified feedstock base as we use thousands of raw materials with most sourced
from multiple suppliers. Our costs by raw material are set forth in the chart below.

Across most of our product lines, we benefit from contractual or market-based mechanics by which price changes
in key raw materials are passed on to customers, with pricing mechanics including monthly to semi-annual
adjustments. As a result, our margins are generally protected from swings in underlying raw material prices.
While electricity is our largest input cost, representing 16% of our inputs and raw material costs in fiscal 2017,
we hedge approximately 75% of our electricity costs at least 12 months forward. Furthermore, at our innovative
Chemical Islands in Brazil, we directly purchase the electricity required to run our bleaching chemicals plants
from our customers at attractive prices, providing a lower cost energy source. While oil derivatives account for
approximately 20% of our raw materials cost, the foregoing factors have allowed us to maintain our margins with
limited exposure to oil price fluctuations, as demonstrated by the chart below.

Our product portfolio also benefits from various points of integration across value chains, helping to reduce our
input costs and their volatility, and improve reliability of supply. In IC, we are significantly backward integrated
into salt, electricity, and steam, providing critical reliability and stability for our customers, and our ESD product
family supplies ethylene oxide to our SC product family providing more stable and reliable input costs.

**_Resilient performance through economic cycles_**

Periods of low and negative market growth have had limited impact on our adjusted EBITDA. We attribute our
stable and resilient adjusted EBITDA performance to (i) a highly variable cost structure, as variable and semivariable costs accounted for approximately 78% of total costs excluding depreciation and amortization in the
LTM Period; (ii) a high degree of product, end-market, customer, and geographic diversification; (iii) significant
portions of our business using raw material pass-through mechanisms; (iv) a strong embedded culture of
operational excellence; and (v) backward integration along key chemical value chains.

Adjusted EBITDA (€mm) Margin (%)

(1) 2007-2013 EBITDA based on reported EBITDA with estimated management adjustments for divestments of our National Starch business
and our Pakistan Chemicals division; periods following January 1, 2014 reflect carve-out financial information and other adjustments as
described in “Use of non-IFRS financial measures.” As a result, periods prior to 2014 may not be comparable to periods following January 1,
2014.

In 2009, during the peak of the global financial crisis, we mitigated declines in volume by capturing the benefit
of lower raw material prices, maintaining adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year. In 2013, the business was
negatively impacted by (i) the European economic slowdown, (ii) price erosion in ethylene amines due to supplydemand imbalance, and (iii) one-time restructuring costs.

Since 2013, we have continued our focus on disciplined portfolio management through actions such as
(i) increasing our exposure to higher growth markets such as Asia and Brazil, (ii) focusing on higher margin
products, such as expandable microspheres, and (iii) limiting our exposure to the secularly declining paper
industry with the sale of our paper chemicals business in 2015. We also implemented structural cost reductions,
such as the shift from mercury to lower cost membrane technology in chlor-alkali and increased operational
efficiency through the roll-out of our continuous improvement program, ALPS. We believe these business mix
and cost structure improvements will further insulate us from fluctuations through the cycle.

136


-----

**_Strong financial profile with robust Free Cash Flow generation_**

We have maintained strong, stable margins due to our ability to pass on price increases in raw material costs, as
well as our focus on operational improvements. In 2014, as a division of AkzoNobel, we implemented ALPS, an
ongoing initiative to increase productivity and performance across critical supply chain functions. ALPS has
been highly successful and has resulted in €121 million of production cost improvements and €149 million of
raw materials efficiency improvements from 2014 to 2017.

This focus on productivity and performance enhancements has in part contributed to our robust financial
performance over the past several years. We have reported approximately 300 bps of margin improvement and
approximately €145 million of Adjusted EBITDA growth since 2015, and for the LTM Period we generated Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA of €1,145 million, representing a 23% margin. The business has strong Free Cash
Flow, and generated approximately €626 million, €629 million, and €690 million of Free Cash Flow during fiscal
2015, fiscal 2016, and fiscal 2017, respectively.

**_Experienced management and Carlyle team with strong track record_**

Our management team consists of a diverse group of experienced professionals with an average of approximately
30 years of business experience both at our Company and in the industry generally. They have a proven track
record of delivering performance improvement and disciplined portfolio management over the years to
successfully position our business for growth. Our management team has been operating the business as a largely
independent company within AkzoNobel, with our operations consolidated into distinct legal entities since
January 1, 2018, with limited shared services agreements with AkzoNobel. The core management team will be
augmented by the addition of Charles Shaver as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Shaver has extensive experience in
the chemicals industry, having served as Chief Executive Officer of Axalta Coating Systems, Ltd., a former
Carlyle portfolio company. He has also held key positions at TPC Group, Inc., GenTek, Arch Chemicals, Molten
Metal Technology, and Dow Chemical.

Carlyle is a leading global alternative asset management firm with extensive experience in successfully
completing corporate carve-out transactions in the industrial sector, and it has a strong track record of sustainable
growth and operational improvements in the companies in which it invests.

**Our business strategies**

**_Leverage existing product portfolio and global footprint to expand market share and capitalize on growth_**
**_trends_**

We intend to leverage our leadership positions in attractive applications and geographies to expand our market
share and capture new high margin opportunities. For example, in our IC product family, we expect to gain
market share as a result of targeted investments to grow with contracted customer demand, such as the addition
of chlor-alkali capacity at our facility in Rotterdam and the expansion of our salt production capacity in Delfzijl,
the Netherlands. In our SC product family, our focus on higher value products, as well as our strong innovation
pipeline, is expected to help us drive growth with new and existing customers. In our PPC product family, we are
the largest sodium chlorate producer in the Brazilian market, which is one of the fastest growing pulp markets
globally, and we are well positioned to capture the region’s superior growth potential. In our PC product family,
our organic peroxides manufacturing footprint has positioned us to capture higher growth in China and North
America, as well as in niche applications such as HPMO. Finally, in our ESD product family, we are focused on
our biodegradable and micronutrient product offerings, allowing us to capture share in the growing automatic
dishwashing detergent and fertigation markets.

**_Continue to pursue innovation and leverage our customer and end-market expertise as key growth drivers_**

Our ability to innovate has not only contributed to growth in the last several years, but will also enable us to
further grow share with both new and existing customers. We believe that our focus on innovation will enable us
to outpace overall market growth. Our RD&I organization and facilities are best-in-class, with employees

137


-----

dedicated to individual product families, and in some cases working alongside our customers. As a result, we are
able to leverage know-how, assets, and infrastructure across our product families, as well as share knowledge and
expertise regarding end-markets and customers’ needs. In addition, we seek outside opportunities to further our
innovation pipeline, including through collaboration and innovation with universities and start-ups. We intend to
leverage our close customer relationships and RD&I collaboration to react quickly to changing market dynamics
and to better serve and tailor solutions for our customers.

Our focus on new products and application development has enabled us to increase our share of revenue derived
from recently introduced products from 8% in 2013 to 12% in 2017. Compared to the rest of the portfolio, these
sales generally capture higher margins and higher growth, and we expect to maintain or grow our current pace of
innovation going forward. Innovation, customer intimacy, and end-market expertise have been important
components of our historical success and as we enter a new chapter in our history with Carlyle as our partner, we
intend to continue our commitment to these principles, positioning us well to meet the needs of our customers
and achieve growth.

**_Realize operational and commercial improvement opportunities as a standalone company_**

As a standalone company, and in connection with our new ownership, we plan to expand and accelerate a number
of cost-saving initiatives already underway, as well as focus on additional commercial improvement
opportunities. We intend to enhance our business processes, including further centralizing procurement activities,
improving manufacturing productivity, and reducing maintenance expense through predictive rather than reactive
maintenance. We expect to realize approximately €51 million of these cash cost savings within 24 months of the
Closing Date.

We also believe that there is potential to realize additional material benefits from commercial excellence
initiatives. We believe we can improve sales force efficiency by reviewing the key account management
infrastructure, re-evaluating and improving sales incentives mechanisms, reviewing pricing processes and
governance, and deploying tools to provide support to our sales teams. We expect that such initiatives will
increase both revenue and margins.

**_Emphasize free cash flow generation to facilitate deleveraging_**

One of our primary goals is to generate cash flow to facilitate deleveraging. To achieve this goal, we will place
significant management emphasis on cash generation, efficient capital spending, and working capital
management, including linking a portion of management’s compensation to cash flow generation. Historically,
we have been able to generate strong cash flow while meeting the capital requirements of our business, and we
believe we are well positioned to continue improving free cash flow. In the past few years, we have made
significant investments focused on technology efficiency and capacity growth. This has resulted in a wellinvested asset base with lower on-going capital requirements. Our separation from AkzoNobel will provide us
with more flexibility for efficient capital allocation and is expected to enable our management to further drive the
business to reach its potential as a standalone company.

Industrial Chemicals is a market leader in its core markets. Market positions across the IC portfolio include:

   - Chlor-alkali: #1 in merchant chlorine in Western Europe and #2 in merchant caustic soda in Western
Europe

   - Industrial salt: #1 in chemical transformation salt in Western Europe, with an approximately 52%
market share

   - MCA: #1 globally, with an approximately 28% market share

   - Methyl chloride: #1 in Western Europe, with an approximately 43% market share

   - Methylene chloride: #1 in Western Europe, with an approximately 36% market share

Industrial Chemicals is a process technology leader with leading know-how and a focus on innovation across all
product categories. In Europe, for chlor-alkali production, we have been a leader in the shift from mercury
technology to more cost-effective membrane technology in response to stringent new environmental regulations
that have mandated the complete phase out of the mercury process. We were the first to fully convert our
production to the membrane process, while our competitors collectively retired approximately 7% of installed
chlor-alkali capacity in Western Europe in response to these regulations. This has allowed us to operate at a
lower cost while also capturing market share. We also have the technology and know-how to supply the highest
grade salt in our industrial salt product line, allowing us to meet the needs of all customers and capture higher
margins.

We are significantly backward integrated into salt, electricity, and steam, helping to provide critical supply
reliability for our customers. Integration into core customer operations, including via networks of chlorine supply
pipelines, represents an integral part of our value proposition. This infrastructure integration allows us to enter
into long-term contracts with our chlorine customers, with an average contract length of over ten years with such
customers. These contracts also typically include raw material pass-through mechanisms and help to provide
long-term stability to our financial results. Industrial Chemicals serves approximately 2,800 customers globally,
predominantly large chemical companies, including Covestro, Huntsman, and Shin-Etsu. Industrial Chemicals
also supplies salt, caustic soda, and MCA to other product families. The business is focused on the Western
European region in close proximity to our downstream customers due to transportation requirements for our
products. IC’s manufacturing facilities are among the most productive and technologically advanced in the
industry, driving efficiencies and economies of scale.

Industrial Chemicals operates nine manufacturing facilities and six joint ventures: 11 in Europe, three in Asia and
one in North America. In addition, IC utilizes our multi-product-family RD&I site in Deventer, the Netherlands.
As of December 31, 2017, IC had approximately 1,800 employees.

_Process and Raw Materials_

The chlor-alkali process simultaneously produces chlorine and caustic soda in a 1 : 1.1 weight ratio through the
electrolysis of high purity industrial salt solution (brine). We exclusively use the membrane process to produce
our chlor-alkali. We use vacuum processing to produce the highest purity industrial salt, which is a key input for
the chlor-alkali process. Through our ownership of salt mines, we are fully backward integrated into industrial
salt, which we also refine to produce salt specialties. Chlorine can be further processed to produce chlorine
derivatives. MCA is produced by the chlorination of acetic acid while chloromethanes are produced by the
chlorination of methane.

Input sourced externally Input sourced partially internally Output

As a result of our backward integration into salt, the most significant input costs for the Industrial Chemicals
product family are electricity, natural gas, and steam, which represent approximately 50% of IC’s raw material
costs. Electricity is required in large amounts for the electrolysis of brine in the chlor-alkali process, and steam is
a significant input in the production of industrial salts. Although we are not fully backward integrated into
energy, as we are with industrial salt, IC does internally produce approximately 40% of its electricity and
approximately 85% of its steam requirements, with an increasing use of renewables in its energy mix. We also
engage in a prudent hedging strategy designed to further limit our exposure to volatility in energy prices. IC
hedges approximately 75% of its electricity costs at least 12 months forward. We are also often able to pass
through energy cost fluctuations to our customers through contractual mechanisms.

To ensure reliability of supply, we typically purchase raw materials directly from local suppliers on contracts
with terms generally ranging from two to three years. Industrial Chemicals is not dependent on a sole supplier for
most inputs. We have a dedicated IC procurement team made up of specialists in the product family who are able
to respond quickly to changing business dynamics, and who are supported by the Company’s centralized
procurement function.

_Distribution_

Select product lines in the IC product family are sold regionally due to their characteristics:

   - Chlorine is highly reactive and is difficult to transport and store; it is primarily delivered in large
quantities to co-located customers via pipeline (over 90% of IC’s chlorine sales)

   - Industrial salt, though safe to handle and transport, has a high bulk-to-value ratio and is typically
delivered via a network of inland barges dedicated to specific customers

   - Salt specialties face regional regulations due to their use in food and pharmaceutical applications and are
typically delivered via truck or rail

Caustic soda is safe to handle and transport and can be shipped globally but is largely sold regionally given its
high bulk-to-value ratio.

MCA is an easily transportable chemical and is sold globally.

_Customers_

IC serves approximately 2,800 customers globally, predominantly large chemical companies including Covestro,
Huntsman, and Shin-Etsu. Integration into core customer operations, supported by our strategic manufacturing
footprint across Europe and infrastructure connecting customers via pipelines, represents a core part of our value
proposition, especially where we supply large volumes of key raw materials and intermediates that are essential
for customers’ downstream production processes. We are located close to our customers, which is critical for
products that are hazardous to transport, such as chlorine, or those with high relative transportation costs, such as
salt. IC’s customer relationships are usually long given our products’ sustainable competitive advantages,
including infrastructure integration with customers. Contract durations vary by product with an average contract
length of three to five years for chlorine, one to two years for caustic soda, and two to five years for MCA, and
our top three customers each have an average relationship length of approximately 20 years. We also supply
industrial salt to PPC in Europe, chloromethanes to ESD and SC, MCA to ESD and SC, and caustic soda to PPC
and ESD, all based on market prices.

   - Colloidal silica: #2 globally, with an approximately 20% market share

   - Separation products: #1 globally, with an approximately 31% market share

Our technology leadership has been critical to the success of PPC and we have pioneered and developed unique
offerings for our customers, which we consider a key competitive advantage in our respective markets. In
bleaching chemicals, we are one of the few producers able to offer a comprehensive package to our customers,
which includes both sodium chlorate and chlorine dioxide process equipment. Furthermore, we have established
the Chemical Island concept, whereby our sodium chlorate plant is co-located with our customer’s pulp mill. The
customer provides us with electricity required to run our bleaching chemicals production plant at attractive
prices, and we sell the customer the chlorine dioxide needed for pulp bleaching. Our Chemical Islands are
sustainable and cost-advantaged, with limited handling and transport requirements. The high initial capital
requirements, co-location, and integration with our customers result in long term customer relationships, as
evidenced by 70% of our South American sodium chlorate contracts being 15 years in length.

Our technological leadership in performance chemicals has enabled us to offer value-add, IP-protected products
to our customers. Specifically in expandable microspheres, instead of expanding our products at our facilities, we
have the ability to ship unexpanded microspheres to our customers and are the only manufacturer that offers
on-site expansion technology. This allows us to ship more product per truckload, thereby lowering transportation
costs. In silica products, we have IP-protected modified colloidal silica for unique customer applications, such as
self-cleaning coatings.

Pulp and Performance Chemicals operates 25 manufacturing facilities, with eight in Europe, eight in South
America, six in North America, and three in Asia. In addition, it has two RD&I sites in Stockvik and Bohus,
Sweden. As of December 31, 2017, PPC had approximately 1,800 employees.

_Process and Raw Materials_

Sodium chlorate is produced through an electrochemical process using salt, water, and electricity as primary raw
materials. Hydrogen peroxide is also produced in an electrochemical process using hydrogen (a byproduct from
sodium chlorate production) and oxygen.

Colloidal silica is produced by passing a solution of sodium silicate through an ion exchange column to partially
remove the sodium ions, forming a silica suspension. Caustic soda, sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, and
sodium aluminate are also consumed during the process. Expandable microspheres are produced by creating
thermoplastic spheres filled with an expandable gas through batch production using colloidal silica as a process

Energy represents the largest portion of PPC’s raw material costs, accounting for over 50% of total PPC raw
material cost. We benefit from the Company’s overall energy purchasing power and hedging strategy, including
hedging approximately 75% of our electricity costs at least 12 months forward. Additionally, through our
Chemical Islands in Brazil, we are able to purchase electricity at attractive rates from our customers. Further,
contracts for our sodium chlorate customers generally contain electricity cost pass-through mechanisms. For salt
and caustic soda, two of the other major feedstocks, we are backward integrated through our Industrial Chemicals
product family, providing secure supply as well as competitive pricing. Given these dynamics, PPC has limited
exposure to raw material price volatility. We have a dedicated PPC procurement team made up of specialists in
the product family who are able to respond quickly to changing business dynamics, and who are supported by the
Company’s centralized procurement function.

_Distribution_

Bleaching chemicals are largely regional product lines. For sodium chlorate, we typically sell our product
directly to our customers in large volumes via railcar. We have notably developed a differentiated offering in


152


-----

South America, known as Chemical Islands, whereby our sodium chlorate plant is located on the same site as the
pulp mill customer. The customer provides us with electricity required to run our bleaching chemicals production
plant at attractive prices, and we sell the customer the chlorine dioxide needed for pulp bleaching. The process is
sustainable and cost-advantaged, creating customer stickiness and providing stability to the business. The high
initial capital requirements, co-location, and integration with our customers result in long-term customer
relationships, as evidenced by 70% of our South American sodium chlorate contracts being 15 years in length.

Hydrogen peroxide is also a regional product line, as it is a reactive material with high transportation costs. As a
result of our production locations, we are largely focused on the Nordics and the United States. We primarily sell
directly to our customers and have limited sales through distributors.

We are a global supplier of expandable microspheres, which we can ship to our customers in either expanded or
unexpanded form. We increasingly transport expandable microspheres in their unexpanded form, allowing our
customers to expand them at their own facilities using our equipment. This results in lower transportation costs
for customers, additional revenue through lease fees on the on-site equipment, and higher customer loyalty.

We are also a global supplier of colloidal silica, which we sell both directly to customers and through
distributors. Separation products are primarily sold directly to customers.

_Customers_

Pulp and Performance Chemicals serves approximately 2,000 customers globally. Our largest bleaching
chemicals customers are large pulp companies including SCA, Fibria, Domtar, GeorgiaPacific, and Suzano. We
often enter long-term contracts with our PPC customers, with contract lengths at our Chemical Islands up to 15
years in length and contracts for the production of hydrogen peroxide mostly multi-year in length. PPC also
supplies hydrogen peroxide to our PC, SC, and ESD product families.

Most of our PC product family’s major feedstocks are widely available from a large number of suppliers and
have low supply risk. Hydrogen peroxide is partially backward integrated and is sourced from our Pulp and
Performance Chemicals product family. Raw materials are typically purchased directly from global suppliers on
long-term contracts (one to three years length on average; up to five years) to ensure supply reliability. We
maintain margins, even as raw material prices fluctuate, through value-added pricing and contractual passthrough of raw material costs, with approximately 30% of PC revenues associated with customer contracts
having escalation clauses for key raw materials. We have a dedicated PC procurement team made up of
specialists in the product family who are able to respond quickly to changing business dynamics, and who are
supported by the Company’s centralized procurement function.

requiring specialized cooled containers to transport. Shipment for most peroxides is therefore generally limited to


158


-----

trucking within 500 to 1,000 miles. As a result, although we produce peroxides globally, we serve regional
markets. Metal alkyls and high-purity metal organics are also highly reactive compounds, which have high safety
requirements for handling and transportation. Both metal alkyls and high-purity metal organics have to be
transported in specially designed cylinders to ensure that safety and purity requirements are met. We utilize
office-based account managers, key accounts, direct sales, and distributors to sell our products to end users.

_Process and Raw Materials_

Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives is a highly interconnected product family which is vertically integrated into
many key feedstocks. We produce ethylene oxide, which is a feedstock for ethylene amines and EHEC. Chelates
are produced from the conversion of ethylene amines using sodium cyanide and hydrogen cyanide. Vinyl acetate
ethylene (“VAE”) emulsion and polyvinyl alcohol solution are the key raw materials used for RPP. Cellulose and
MCA are the most important feedstocks to produce CMC. Carbon disulfide production uses methane as the
carbon source, with hydrogen sulfide as a by-product. NaSH is produced from mixing hydrogen sulfide and
sodium hydroxide together. Ethylene chlorohydrine, diformal, NaSH, and sodium hydroxide are the main
feedstocks for polysulfide production.

**Health, Safety, and Environment**

Health and safety of employees and customers and care for the environment are the focus of our principles and
are fully integrated into our business strategy. Our vision on health, safety, and environment is “zero injuries,
waste and harm,” and all of our activities are underpinned by core principles of safety, integrity and
sustainability. This approach is applicable at all levels of our organization.

Processes to monitor and improve safety across our organization are defined and driven at a central level and
applied in a consistent manner throughout our manufacturing facilities. People, process, and product safety
standards and rules are fully incorporated in the key ALPS process in manufacturing, sourcing and engineering,
which supports our safety objectives. This has resulted in both improved safety performance and increased
maintenance effectiveness. Another aspect of continuous improvement is incident learning: we have implemented a
Company-wide incident reporting system which facilitates the sharing of learning from incidents and prevention.
Other safety initiatives include investigation improvements and non-manufacturing safety procedures.

With respect to environmental policy, we believe we have adopted adequate and effective systems to comply
with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including an environmental risk assessment and remediation
policy. Furthermore, we are actively working to reduce the carbon footprint across our Company. We aim to
(i) continuously improve efficiency by reducing our energy use per ton of production, (ii) work towards
improving our share of renewable energy, and (iii) to improve the environmental footprint of our operations by
focusing on operational eco-efficiency.

**Property, plant, and equipment**

As of January 1, 2018, we had 67 sites and 29 office premises. The following table provides an overview of some
of our material owned and leased properties, which are grouped in two categories: (i) manufacturing facilities

Many of our current and former sites have an extensive history of industrial chemical processing, storage, and related
activities and some of our buildings have in the past contained and may still contain asbestos or other harmful
substances. As is typical for many chemicals businesses, soil and ground water contamination has occurred in the past
at several sites and may occur, or be discovered, at our current and former sites in the future. We believe that the
provisions established are appropriate to meet our present environmental obligations at our current and former sites, as
well as for retained liabilities in connection with divested businesses. At several of our current and former sites,
including several sites located in Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United States, there is historic contamination that
will require monitoring and remediation expenditures for the foreseeable future. However, we believe the historic
contamination does not materially impair utilization of the manufacturing assets. Provisions for environmental costs
were €105 million in fiscal 2017, €133 million in fiscal 2016, and €163 million in fiscal 2015 (including costs for
investigation, remediation, and monitoring). We believe that the provisions established are appropriate to meet our
present environmental obligations at our current and former sites, as well as for retained liabilities in connection with
divested businesses. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to our business—We may incur material costs relating to
_environmental and health and safety requirements or liabilities, which could result in costs, civil or criminal sanctions,_
_or disruption of our business and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of_
_operations.”_

**Legal and arbitration proceedings**

We are involved in a number of judicial and administrative proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
Although adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur in one or more of the cases, it is not possible to estimate the
possible loss or losses from each of these cases. However, we are not involved in any governmental, legal or arbitration
proceedings, and are not aware of any such proceedings which are pending or threatened, that we believe may have,
significant effects on us or our financial position or profitability. The final resolution of these lawsuits, individually or
in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial
condition, or cash flows. We make this determination on the basis of applicable accounting principles and whether or
not we need to form a provision for threatened or pending proceedings. We have reserved $7.5 million in connection

with a claim from the ultimate owners (the “Goldschmidt Group”) of a pine forestry company (“Pino Camby”) and a
resins company (“International Pine Products”) that sold their IPP resins business but not their crude pine forest
business to a former affiliate in 2000. In a mutually exclusive supply agreement, entered into as part of the acquisition,
it was agreed that IPP would source crude pine resin for its business from Pino Camby. It appeared that Pino Camby
was incapable of meeting its supply obligations in spite of substantial pre-payments and IPP was obliged to procure
crude pine resin from other sources. Not long afterwards, Pino Camby filed for bankruptcy. It further appeared that
under ownership of the Goldschmidt Group, IPP had provided undisclosed guarantees to banking creditors of Pino
Camby and IPP then filed for “chapter 11-like” protection. In 2005 the bankruptcy liquidator of Pino Camby filed a
claim in arbitration alleging breach of contract causing Pino Camby to enter into bankruptcy, seeking lost profits for
the original contract period of 20 years in the amount of $120 million. By a 2006 decision of the tribunal Pino Camby’s
claims were dismissed. However in 2008, two other companies of the Goldschmidt Group called “Damela
Establishment (Damela)” and “Harz und Derivate (HuD)”, as former shareholders of Pino Camby, filed a claim with
another tribunal (the General Arbitration Tribunal of the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange), making similar claims and
alleging damages significantly in excess of the original claim for lost commissions and lost profits plus interests for an
indefinite period of time, which amounts are alleged by the plaintiffs to far exceed the value of the underlying contract.
On May 6, 2017 the Permanent Arbiters of the General Arbitration Tribunal awarded Damela $4.6 million plus interest
as of 2004 for certain withheld payments and dismissed all other claims. Damela and HuD have appealed the decision
in the National Chamber of the Commercial Appellate Court of Buenos Aires (the “Appellate Court”) seeking
annulment of the 2017 decision by the Arbitration Tribunal. While we have also filed an appeal, we have nevertheless
reserved the amount owed in connection with the arbitration tribunal’s award including interest. We do not believe the
Damela and HuD claims or their methodology for calculating damages have any merit. However, it is impossible to
predict how the Appellate Court will rule and there is a remote possibility that the Appellate Court will rule in favor of
Damela and HuD for a material sum. In that event we will appeal such decision to the Supreme Court of Argentina.
Even if we prevail in the pending Appellate Court proceedings, there can be no assurance that Damela and HuD will
not appeal the decision, and if they do, there can be no assurance that other courts will not rule in their favor and award
them damages for a material sum. If the court does not rule in our favor, it could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements—Note 19
_Other provisions and contingent liabilities” and “Risk factors—We are involved in or may become involved in legal_
_proceedings.”_

**Insurance**

We have a centralized insurance organization with certified risk and insurance professionals. The Master
Separation Agreement provides that as from the Closing Date, we will cease to benefit from coverage under the
Seller’s existing insurance policies for accidents, occurrences, or events occurring on or after the Closing Date.

We have set up our own insurance arrangements as of the Closing Date. Our global insurance policies cover a
broad range of losses, including property damage, business interruption, general and product-liability, directors’
and officers’ liability, employment practice liability, pension trust liability, marine / transport, crime, cyber, and
terrorism.

We believe that our insurance coverage, including the maximum coverage amounts and terms and conditions of
the insurance policies, are appropriate and standard for our industry. Our insurance coverage is regularly
evaluated and adjusted as necessary. We cannot, however, guarantee that we will not incur any losses or be the
subject of claims that exceed the scope of the relevant insurance coverage. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to
_our business—We are not insured against all potential risks.” Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that we will be_
able to obtain adequate insurance cover at appropriate conditions in the future.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 9,700 employees in 39 countries. We had approximately
1,800 employees in the Industrial Chemicals product family, 1,600 employees in the Surface Chemistry product
family, 1,800 employees in the Pulp and Performance Chemicals product family, 1,300 employees in the

Polymer Chemistry product family, 1,800 employees in the Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives product family and
1,000 employees working in other capacities. We had approximately 5,300 employees in Europe, 1,700
employees in the U.S. and Canada, 1,000 employees in South America and 1,700 employees in Asia.

Employees in some of our locations are subject to collective bargaining agreements, which are often negotiated
with trade unions or employees, or are represented by works councils. We believe that our relations with our
employees are generally good.

**Employment and compensation arrangements**

We have agreed, from the effective time of the Acquisition through the second anniversary of the effective time
of the Acquisition and except as otherwise agreed to with an employee representative body (if applicable), to
provide to our employees who were employed by AkzoNobel at the time of the Acquisition certain levels of
compensation and benefits, based on the levels of compensation and benefits previously provided to them by
AkzoNobel. Generally, we will provide, subject to certain exceptions and limitations, base salary, wage rates,
target annual incentive compensation opportunities and employee benefits which are considered, overall, no less
favorable than what were provided to such employees immediately prior to the Acquisition. In addition, we have
agreed that, from the effective time of the Acquisition through the second anniversary of the effective time of the
Acquisition, employees will be entitled to claim any severance payment or other arrangement in any severance,

-----

relocation or similar policy applicable at the Closing Date in accordance with and subject to the terms and
conditions of such policy, and that the principal place of work of the employees will not materially change other
than with the employee’s consent. We may also, from time to time, enter into employment or severance
agreements with executive management and other key employees that provide compensation or benefits,
including severance protections, in excess of those described above. In addition, we anticipate that equity-based
awards may be granted to senior management and other key employees under a new equity-based incentive
program. Such awards would generally vest over a number of years, subject to continued employment, and/or
upon achievement of certain performance targets, and would entitle management to share in the future
appreciation in the equity value of the Dutch Co-Issuer or an affiliate of the Dutch Co-Issuer.

175

**Security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management**

Immediately following the Acquisition, the Dutch Co-Issuer will be a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings, and the U.S. Co-Issuer and Swedish Co-Issuer will each be an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings and each a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer. Holdings is a newly formed private
company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the
laws of the Netherlands and registered with the Dutch trade register under number 71190643, all of the
outstanding capital stock of which will be owned indirectly by the Sponsors and certain of its co-investors. See
“Capitalization.”

**Certain relationships and related party transactions**

**Services Agreements**

We or one of our affiliates expect to enter into services agreements with Carlyle, on or around the Closing Date,
pursuant to which we will pay Carlyle a fee for advisory, consulting, monitoring, and other services to be
provided to us and our subsidiaries. We or one of our affiliates expect to pay an annual fee of approximately €3
million to our Sponsors during the term of the agreements. The annual fee is payable on a quarterly basis
beginning on the Closing Date. Unless otherwise agreed by Carlyle, each such services agreement will terminate
upon an initial public offering or certain sale transactions (including a sale of a majority of the equity securities
of the Parent or a sale of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Parent and its subsidiaries). In the
event of termination upon (i) an initial public offering or (ii) certain sale transactions, we or one of our affiliates
will be required to pay to Carlyle a lump sum termination payment equal to the then present value of all unpaid
fees due to Carlyle, and all future fees that would be payable to Carlyle if the agreement remained in effect
through and including the earlier of (x) the initial termination date of each agreement (the earlier of the tenth
anniversary of the Closing Date and the date on which the Carlyle entity that owns equity in the Parent is
dissolved in accordance with the terms of its applicable partnership or other governing agreement), or, if
terminated subsequent to the initial termination date, through and including the last day of such year and (y) the
fifth anniversary of the date of such termination. We or one of our affiliates also expect to reimburse the
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Carlyle in connection with services provided pursuant to the
services agreements, and we or one of our affiliates may pay Carlyle additional fees associated with other future
transactions or in consideration of any additional services provided to us under the services agreements.
Additionally, we or one of our affiliates will indemnify Carlyle and certain other persons as described in the
services agreements against, among other things, all actions, causes of action, suits, claims, liabilities, losses,
damages, costs, and expenses arising out of, incurred in connection with or as a result of the services provided to
us or one of our affiliates pursuant to the services agreements. Within 90 days of entering into the services
agreements, we or one of our affiliates will pay a one-time initial fee of approximately €50 million to Carlyle in
consideration of certain services provided to the Parent in connection with the Transactions.

**Employment Agreements**

From time to time, we may also enter into other employment or compensation arrangements with senior
management or other key employees. See “Management—Employment and compensation arrangements.”

**Sales to Portfolio Companies of Funds Affiliated with the Sponsors**

From time to time, we make sales to portfolio companies of funds that are affiliated with the Sponsors, but these
sales are not material and such sales are done on an arms-length basis.

**Indemnification Agreements**

Prior to the completion of this offering, we expect to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our
directors and certain of our officers. These indemnification agreements will provide the directors and officers
with contractual rights to indemnification and expense advancement. We believe that these indemnification
agreements are, in form and substance, substantially similar to those commonly entered into in transactions of
like size and complexity sponsored by private equity firms.

**Description of new senior secured credit facilities**

Following is a description of our new senior secured credit facilities that we will enter into substantially
simultaneously with the closing of the Acquisition. The following summary of certain provisions of these
agreements that will govern our new senior secured credit facilities in connection with the Acquisition does not
purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information that is important to you, and is subject to, and
qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the corresponding agreements.

**Overview**

We expect to enter into our new senior secured credit facilities with Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, J.P.
Morgan Securities plc, Credit Suisse International, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, RBC Capital Markets,
LLC, Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Nomura Securities
International, Inc., UBS Securities LLC, BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV, Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment
Bank, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., MUFG Bank, Ltd., The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Société Générale London
Branch, and Bank of China Limited as joint bookrunners, and other agents and lenders party thereto from time to
time. Our new senior secured credit facilities will consist of a new dollar term loan facility, a new euro term loan
facility, and a new multi-currency revolving credit facility. Our new dollar term loan facility in the U.S. dollar
equivalent of €3,325 million and our new euro term loan facility of €1,790 million will be used to fund, in part,
the Transactions. Our new revolving credit facility will provide for revolving loans and letters of credit pursuant
to commitments in an aggregate principal amount of the €750 million, with a letter of credit sublimit to be
agreed. We intend to use future borrowings under our new revolving credit facility to fund working capital and
for other general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions and other investments. Our ability to draw
under our new revolving credit facility or issue letters of credit thereunder will be conditioned upon, among other
things, delivery of required notices, accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the credit
agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities and the absence of any default or event of default
under our new senior secured credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions.

Subject to certain conditions, after the initial borrowing date under our new senior secured credit facilities (which
date is expected to be the Closing Date), without the consent of the then existing lenders (but subject to the
receipt of commitments), our new term loan facilities and/or our new revolving credit facility may be increased
by (or additional term loan facilities or revolving credit facilities may be added in) an aggregate amount (for both
the term loans and revolving loans) not to exceed the sum of (x) the greater of the U.S. dollar equivalent of
€1,025 million and Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement governing our new
senior secured credit facilities), (y) an unlimited amount so long as on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
incurrence of any such incremental loans or increase in our new revolving credit facility commitments and/or our
new term loan facilities (and after giving effect to any acquisition consummated concurrently therewith and all
other appropriate pro forma adjustment events and calculated as if any increase in revolving credit facility
commitments or any incremental revolving credit facility were fully drawn on the effective date thereof but
without giving effect to the cash proceeds of such incremental facility then being incurred), (a) for any such debt
that is secured by the collateral on a pari passu basis with the new term loan facilities, the consolidated first lien
net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such
request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted investment, the consolidated first lien
net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt; (b) for any such debt that is secured by the
collateral on a junior basis to the new term loan facilities, the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio, in
each case on a pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 5.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt
to be incurred in connection with a permitted investment, the consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio
immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt; (c) for any such debt that is secured by assets that do not secure
the new term loan facilities, the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, does not
exceed either (i) 6.50:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a
permitted investment, the consolidated total net leverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt;
and (d) for any such debt that is unsecured, (x) the consolidated total net leverage ratio, in each case on a

178


-----

pro forma basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred
in connection with a permitted investment, the consolidated total net leverage ratio immediately prior to the
incurrence of such debt or (y) the fixed charge coverage ratio, in each case on a pro forma basis, is not less than
either (i) 2.00:1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to debt to be incurred in connection with a permitted
investment, the fixed charge coverage ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such debt plus (z) an amount
equal to (i) all voluntary prepayments and repurchases of pari passu term loans borrowed under the credit
agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities and (ii) voluntary prepayment of revolving loans
borrowed under the credit agreement governing our new senior secured credit facilities to the extent
accompanied by a corresponding permanent reduction in the commitment therefor, subject to certain conditions.
In addition, we intend to replace an existing line of credit for certain bank guarantees and letters of credit for
trade financing of certain of our operating companies with an incremental facility under our credit agreement that
will be secured and guaranteed equally and ratably with our new senior secured facilities. This existing line of
credit currently has approximately €30 million of issued letters of credit and bank guarantees and will have
capacity for issuance of up to €45 million of letters of credit and bank guarantees in the aggregate. This
incremental facility is expected to be established shortly after the consummation of the Transactions and prior to
December 31, 2018.

**Interest rate and fees**

Borrowings under the new revolving credit facility and the new dollar term loan facility will bear interest at a
floating rate which can be, at our option, either (i) LIBOR plus an applicable margin or (ii) an alternate base rate
plus an applicable margin, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.00% or a base rate floor of 1.00%. Borrowings under
the new euro term loan facility will bear interest at EURIBOR plus an applicable margin, subject to a EURIBOR
floor of 0.00%. The applicable margin for our new term loans and our revolving credit facilities will be subject to
adjustment based on our consolidated first lien leverage ratio with one ratio-based 25 basis point step down for
the new dollar term loan facility, one ratio-based 25 basis point step down for the new euro term loan facility,
and four ratio-based 25 basis point step downs for our new revolving facilities. In addition, the term loan
facilities will include a 25 basis point step down upon completion of an initial public offering by the credit group.

The following fees will be applicable under our new revolving credit facility: (i) an unused line fee of 0.50% per
annum, subject to a step down to 0.375% per annum if our consolidated first lien net leverage ratio is equal to or
less than 4.50x as of the Closing Date, with respect to the unused portion of our new revolving credit facility;
(ii) a per annum letter of credit fee on the aggregate stated amount of each letter of credit available to be drawn
equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans under our new revolving credit facility; (iii) a letter of credit
fronting fee equal to 0.125% per quarter on the aggregate stated amount of each letter of credit available to be
drawn; and (iv) certain other customary fees and expenses.

Our new revolving credit facility matures six years after the Closing Date and our new term loan facilities mature
seven years after the Closing Date.

Commencing with the last day of the second full quarter ending after the Closing Date, our new dollar term loan
facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the original
principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity. Amortization of our new dollar term
loan facility may be reduced as a result of the application of prepayments to the dollar term loans or increased as
a result of the incurrence of additional dollar term loans. There will be no amortization of our new revolving
credit facility or our new euro term loan facility, with the aggregate principal amount thereof due at final
maturity.

**Mandatory prepayments**

We may voluntarily prepay loans or reduce commitments under our new senior secured credit facilities, in whole
or in part, in minimum principal amounts to be agreed, with prior notice, subject to reimbursement of the lenders’

179


-----

redeployment costs in the case of a prepayment of LIBOR rate borrowings other than the last day of the relevant
interest period and subject to a 1.00% premium on any amounts prepaid in connection with a repricing
transaction (subject to certain exceptions) within 6 months after the Closing Date.

We must prepay our new term loan facilities with 100% of the net cash proceeds (which will be defined to
exclude, among other things, (i) the amount of any tax or tax distribution paid or reasonably estimated to be
payable in connection with such sale or disposition, (ii) the repayment of customer deposits required upon such
sale, (iii) the repayment of any indebtedness secured by a lien on the asset subject to the prepayment event, and
(iv) Distributable Asset Sale Proceeds (as defined in the credit agreement governing our new senior secured
credit facilities) to the extent actually distributed) of non-ordinary course asset sales and casualty and
condemnation events (subject to certain reinvestment rights and step downs to 50% and 0% based on
achievement of specified consolidated first lien leverage ratio levels, the incurrence or issuance of indebtedness
(other than indebtedness permitted to be incurred under our new senior secured credit facilities unless
specifically incurred to refinance a portion of our new senior secured credit facilities), and 50% of excess cash
flow (such percentage to be subject to reductions based on the achievement of specified consolidated first lien net
leverage ratios), in each case, subject to certain exceptions.

**Security and guarantees**

Our obligations under our new senior secured credit facilities will be guaranteed by Holdings and each of our
current and future direct and indirect restricted subsidiaries other than (i) subsidiaries designated as unrestricted,
(ii) certain immaterial subsidiaries, (iii) any subsidiary that is prohibited by applicable law, rule, or regulation or
contractual obligation from guaranteeing our new senior secured credit facilities or which would require
governmental (including regulatory) consent, approval, license, or authorization to provide a guarantee unless
such consent, approval, license, or authorization has been received, (iv) not-for-profit subsidiaries, if any, (v) any
non-U.S. subsidiary for which the providing of a guarantee would reasonably be expected to result in any
violation or breach of, or conflict with, fiduciary duties of such subsidiary’s officers, directors or managers,
(vi) any “controlled foreign corporation” within the meaning of Section 957 of the Code in which the U.S.
Co-Issuer (or any of the U.S. Co-Issuer’s subsidiaries) owns (within the meaning of Section 958(a) of the Code)
10% or more of the equity interests by either voting power or value (each, a “Controlled Non-U.S. Subsidiary”)
or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof, (vii) any subsidiary of the U.S. Co-Issuer substantially all of the
assets of which consist of equity interests and/or indebtedness of one or more Controlled Non-U.S. Subsidiaries
and/or one or more other FSHCOs (each a “FSHCO”) or any direct or indirect subsidiary thereof, (viii) certain
other special purpose entities, (ix) any restricted subsidiary acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted under
our new senior secured credit facilities financed with secured indebtedness permitted to be incurred pursuant to
our new senior secured credit facilities as assumed indebtedness (and not incurred in contemplation of such
acquisition) and any restricted subsidiary thereof that guarantees such indebtedness, in each case to the extent
and so long as such secured indebtedness prohibits such subsidiary from becoming a guarantor of our new senior
secured credit facilities, and (x) certain other subsidiaries as set forth under our new senior secured credit
facilities, in each case, subject to certain other exceptions including, without limitation, certain guaranty and
security principles applicable to foreign subsidiaries.

Our obligations under our new senior secured credit facilities will be secured by a first priority lien on
substantially all of our, Holdings’ and each subsidiary guarantor’s assets, including our capital stock and the
capital stock of each of our and our subsidiary guarantors’ direct restricted subsidiaries (which in the case of any
Controlled Non-U.S. Subsidiary or any FSHCO, shall be limited to 65% of the voting equity interests in such
subsidiary), in each case, subject to certain exceptions, including, without limitation, certain guaranty and
security principles applicable to foreign subsidiaries.

**Covenants**

Our new senior secured credit facilities will contain customary negative covenants, including, but not limited to,
restrictions on our and our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur

180


-----

indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay
dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay certain junior lien or payment subordinated
indebtedness, enter into certain restrictive agreements, or change our fiscal year. With respect to our new
revolving credit facility, we will also be required to maintain a maximum first lien net leverage ratio, to be tested,
commencing with the third full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, at the end of any quarter when more than
35% of our new revolving credit facility (excluding all letters of credit (whether cash collateralized or not), any
amounts drawn to fund certain original issuance discount or upfront fees, and certain ordinary course ancillary
facilities incurred under the revolving credit facility, and further reduced by up to $100 million of cash on our
balance sheet that is the result of certain equity overfunding on the Closing Date, the proceeds of which have not
otherwise been utilized to make distributions or dividends) is utilized at such date. In addition, our new senior
secured credit facilities will contain a negative covenant restricting certain activities of Holdings.

Our new senior secured credit facilities will contain customary affirmative covenants, including, but not limited
to, delivery of financial and other information to the administrative agent, notice to the administrative agent upon
the occurrence of certain material events and annual lender calls, upon request, preservation of existence,
payment of material taxes and other claims, maintenance of properties and insurance, maintenance of books and
records, access to properties and records for inspection by the administrative agent, compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, further assurances and provision of
additional collateral and guarantees, and requirements with respect to transactions with affiliates.

**Events of default**

obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default
include payment defaults to the lenders, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant
defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness (including the Notes), voluntary and involuntary
bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments, material ERISA/pension plan events, certain change of

GmbH, Akzo Nobel Industrial Chemicals GmbH, Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding LLC, Akzo Nobel Chemicals,
LLC and their respective subsidiaries with exceptions.

Certain of the above described terms for our new senior secured credit facilities are subject to continuing
negotiation between us and our prospective lenders and could change in the definitive documentation for our new
senior secured credit facilities.

**Description of Notes**

**General**
In this description, (1) the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Starfruit Finco B.V., a private company with
limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands with corporate seat in Rotterdam, the Netherlands and registered with the Dutch chamber of
commerce under number 71194339 (the “Dutch Co-Issuer”), Starfruit US Holdco LLC, a limited liability
company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware and an indirect Subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer
(the “U.S. Co-Issuer”), and, after the Acquisition Date and its accession as an obligor under the Indenture,
Starfruit Swedish Bidco AB, a Swedish entity with corporate registration number 559138-5405 and a direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer (the “Swedish Co-Issuer”), and their consolidated Subsidiaries being
purchased in the Acquisition (as defined herein) and (2) the term “Issuers” in this description refers only to
(a) prior to the Acquisition Date, the Dutch Co-Issuer and the U.S. Co-Issuer and (b) after the Acquisition date
and its accession as an obligor, the Swedish Co-Issuer, together with the Dutch Co-Issuer and the U.S. Co-Issuer
and not, in each case, to any of their Subsidiaries.

For purposes of this description, the dollar denominated % Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Dollar Notes”)
and the Euro denominated % Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Euro Notes”) are collectively referred to as
the “Notes.” The Notes are to be issued under an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated as of the Issue Date,
among the Issuers and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). On the Acquisition
Date, the Restricted Subsidiaries that become guarantors under the Senior Credit Agreement on such date will
enter into the Indenture and will become parties to the Indenture as guarantors of the Notes. Copies of the
Indenture may be obtained from the Issuers upon request after the Issue Date. The Notes will be issued in a
private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and the Indenture will
not be qualified under or subject to, and will not incorporate (by reference or otherwise), any of the provisions of
the TIA. Application will be made to list the Euro Notes on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange. There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted. We do not intend to have the Dollar
Notes listed on a securities exchange or to arrange for the quotation thereof on any automated deal quotation
system.

This offering is expected to be consummated on, 2018, which may be prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition. If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Date, pending consummation of the
Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, (x) an amount in cash equal to the gross
proceeds of this offering of the Dollar Notes into an escrow account (the “Dollar Escrow Account”) and (y) an
amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this offering of the Euro Notes into an escrow account (the “Euro
_Escrow Account” and, together with the Dollar Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts” and each an “Escrow_
Account”) pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (collectively, the “Escrow Agreement”) dated as of the
Issue Date among the Issuers, the Trustee and one or more escrow agents, to be determined (the “Escrow
_Agent”). An affiliate of The Carlyle Group L.P. (the “Carlyle Fund”) will issue an irrevocable equity_
commitment letter to the Dutch Co-Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the other Agents and
the holders of each series of Notes, that will require the Carlyle Fund, upon receipt of a notice of a Special
Mandatory Redemption, to transfer (x) an amount of cash in U.S. dollars to the Dutch Co-Issuer that will be
sufficient, after taking into account the gross proceeds of the Dollar Notes (and any earnings thereon and
investments thereof) contained in the Dollar Escrow Account at such time, to fund the redemption of all of the
Dollar Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent, the
Trustee and the other Agents, pursuant to such Special Mandatory Redemption and (y) an amount of cash in
Euros to the Dutch Co-Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the gross proceeds of the Euro
Notes (and any earnings thereon and investments thereof) contained in the Euro Escrow Account at such time, to
fund the redemption of all of the Euro Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and any fees and
expenses of the Escrow Agent, the Trustee and the other Agents, pursuant to such Special Mandatory
Redemption.

The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds (as defined below), is
more fully described below under “—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.” In the event the

182


-----

Acquisition Date (as defined below under “—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption”) has not
occurred on or before the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be
redeemed at a price equal to (x) with respect to the Dollar Notes, 100.0% of the initial issue price of the Dollar
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as
defined below) and (y) with respect to the Euro Notes, 100.0% of the initial issue price of the Euro Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See “—Escrow of
proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”

The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture and the Notes does not purport to be complete and
is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture and the Notes.
Capitalized terms used in this “Description of notes” section and not otherwise defined have the meanings set
forth in the section “—Certain definitions.”

On the Issue Date, the Dutch Co-Issuer and the U.S. Co-Issuer will issue Dollar Notes with an aggregate
principal amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent as of the date of the “pricing” thereof of €900 million and Euro
Notes with an aggregate principal amount of €485 million. The Swedish Co-Issuer will become an Issuer under
the Indenture after the Acquisition Date by accession and execution and delivery of a supplemental indenture.
The Dollar Notes issued on the Issue Date and the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date will constitute separate
series of Notes under the Indenture but will vote as a single class (except as otherwise described under
“—Amendments and waivers”). The Issuers may from time to time after this offering issue additional Dollar
Notes under the Indenture (“Additional Dollar Notes”) and/or additional Euro Notes under the Indenture
(“Additional Euro Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Notes, “Additional Notes”) without notice to
or the consent of holders of any Notes. Any offering of Additional Notes would be subject to the covenant
described below under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness and issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” The Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will vote as a single class (except as otherwise described under
“—Amendments and waivers”). The Indenture will permit the Issuers to designate the maturity date, interest rate
and optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of Additional Dollar Notes and Additional Euro
Notes, which may differ from the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to the
Dollar Notes and Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of
the Indenture and this “Description of Notes,” references to “Dollar Notes” shall be deemed to include the Dollar
Notes issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Dollar Notes that are actually issued, references to
“Euro Notes” shall be deemed to include the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date as well any Additional Euro
Notes that are actually issued and references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include the Notes issued on the Issue
Date as well as any Additional Notes that are actually issued. Additional Dollar Notes that have the same
maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the Dollar Notes issued on the Issue Date will
be treated as the same series as the Dollar Notes issued on the Issue Date unless otherwise designated by the
Dutch Co-Issuer; provided that a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for any Additional Dollar Notes unless
the Dollar Notes issued on the Issue Date and such Additional Dollar Notes are treated as “fungible” for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. Any Additional Euro Notes that have the same maturity date, interest rate and
optional redemption provisions as the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date will be treated as the same series as
the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date unless otherwise designated by the Dutch Co-Issuer; provided that a
separate ISIN or Common Code will be issued for any Additional Euro Notes unless the Euro Notes issued on the
Issue Date and such Additional Euro Notes are treated as “fungible” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
Issuers will be entitled to vary the application of certain other provisions to any series of Additional Notes.

If a holder of Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the applicable Paying Agent, such
Paying Agent will distribute the payments received of principal of, and, if applicable, interest and premium, if
any, on that holder’s Notes in accordance with those instructions. Distribution of all other payments on the Notes
will be made at the office or agency of the applicable Paying Agent unless the Issuers elect to make interest
payments through such Paying Agent by check mailed to the holders of Notes at their addresses set forth in the
register of holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the

183


-----

Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream (each as defined below) or any such entity’s nominee will be made (x) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof or (y) otherwise in
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will
have rights under the Indenture.

The Dollar Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of
$150,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Euro Notes will be issued only in fully
registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in
excess thereof.

The net proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuers, together with the
borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement and the Equity Contribution, to fund the purchase price for the
Acquisition as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under “Use of proceeds.” This offering is currently
expected to be consummated substantially simultaneously with the consummation of the Acquisition.

**Ranking**

If this offering closes prior to the Acquisition Date, (x) the Dollar Notes will be the Issuers’ general senior
secured obligations and will be secured by a first-priority lien on the Dollar Escrow Funds held in the Dollar
Escrow Account and (y) the Euro Notes will be the Issuers’ general senior secured obligations and will be
secured by a first-priority lien on the Euro Escrow Funds held in the Euro Escrow Account. From and after
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Condition, or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with this
offering, each series of Notes will be joint and several, senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers and will:

   - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future senior Indebtedness of the Issuers (including Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement);

   - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuers (including
Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
Indebtedness;

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of all
Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

   - rank contractually senior in right of payment to future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuers, if any.

As of June 30, 2018, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the Issuers and the guarantors
would have had €6,788 million of total indebtedness, including €25 million of existing capital lease obligations
as well as €263 million of operating lease obligations that will be treated as capital lease obligations and debt for
certain purposes under the Indenture and including €5,115 million of senior secured term loans under our new
senior secured credit facilities and the Issuers would have had an additional €750 million of borrowing capacity
under our new revolving credit facility (without giving effect to a de minimis amount of outstanding letters of
credit expected to be issued under our new revolving credit facility). See “Risk Factors—Despite our level of
indebtedness after the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries may still incur substantially more debt. This could
further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above and impair our ability to operate our
business” and “Description of new senior secured credit facilities.”

Substantially all of the operations of the Issuers are conducted through their Subsidiaries. As a result, the Issuers
are dependent upon dividends and other payments from their Subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet
our outstanding indebtedness service and other obligations and such dividends and other payments may be
restricted by law or the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture and the Senior Credit

184


-----

Agreement or other agreements of our Subsidiaries. Our Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from
operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Unless
a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and claims of
preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuers, including holders of the Notes. The
Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the
amount of additional Indebtedness that the Issuers and their Subsidiaries may Incur, and Preferred Stock that the
Issuers’ Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may issue, such limitations are subject to a number of significant
exceptions.

**Guarantees**

From and after the Acquisition Date, each of the Dutch Co-Issuer’s existing and future Restricted Subsidiaries
(other than a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a CFC Holdco, a direct or indirect Subsidiary of a CFC, the U.S.
Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer or a Subsidiary that is already a Guarantor or obligor) that is an obligor under
or a guarantor under the Senior Credit Agreement or Certain Capital Markets Debt (as defined below), will be
required, to the extent such Restricted Subsidiary is obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant the covenant
described below under “Certain covenants—Future guarantors,” to jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully and
unconditionally guarantee on a senior unsecured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether
at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuers under the Indenture and the
Notes (including interest that, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Issuers, would have
accrued on any Obligation, whether or not a claim is allowed against the Issuers for such interest in the related
bankruptcy proceeding) to the holders and the Trustee, whether for payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors
being herein called the “Guaranteed Obligations”). See “—Certain covenants—Future guarantors.”

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a general, senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor and will:

   - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, be pari passu in right of payment with all existing and
future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including its guarantee of the Indebtedness under the
Senior Credit Agreement);

   - be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including
such Guarantor’s guarantee of Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement and capital leases, if
any) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

   - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of such
Guarantor’s Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

   - rank contractually senior in right of payment to any future Subordinated Indebtedness of such
Guarantor, if any.

Each Guarantee (or primary obligation in the case of the Swedish Co-Issuer) will be limited in amount as
necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and defenses generally available to
guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws,
regulations and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.
See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees.” This includes limiting Guarantees to an
amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without
rendering the Indenture or the Guarantees, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating
to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability
of the guarantees” and “Risk factors—Risks related to the notes and our indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer laws,

185


-----

and similar laws in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions, may permit a court to void the Notes and/or the guarantees
thereof and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.”

Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and
assigns.

A Guarantee of a Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon:

(a) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution)
of (x) the Capital Stock of such Guarantor, if after such transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary, or (y) all or substantially all the assets of such Guarantor if such sale, exchange, disposition or
other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution) is made in compliance with the
Indenture so long as such Guarantor is also released from its guarantee of the Senior Credit Agreement and
Certain Capital Markets Debt (if applicable);

(b) the Issuers designating such Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
provisions set forth under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary;”

(c) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Acquisition Date is required to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Future Guarantors,” (x) the release or
discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (or the co-issuer or co-borrower obligation of such
Restricted Subsidiary) of Indebtedness of the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuers or (y) the
repayment of the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to
guarantee the Notes (except if a release, discharge or repayment is by or as a result of payment in
connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other guarantee of Indebtedness) unless, in each
case of clauses (x) and (y), at the time of such release, discharge or repayment, such Guarantor is then a
guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would require it to provide a Guarantee
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain covenants—Future Guarantors”;

(d) the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Indenture is discharged (including through redemption or repurchase of all the
Notes as a result of satisfaction and discharge or otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(e) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of the Obligations
under the Senior Credit Agreement (except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection
with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation) unless at the time of such
release or discharge such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness
that would require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
covenants—Future Guarantors”; or

(f) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event as described in “—Certain covenants.”

A Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a
result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the Senior Credit Agreement or other exercise
of remedies in respect thereof.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries that are anticipated to be Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries
accounted for approximately 25% of our revenues and 20% of our earnings before interest and taxes, before
giving effect to carve-out adjustments reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. As of

186


-----

December 31, 2017, our subsidiaries anticipated to be Non-Guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately
30% of our assets, before giving effect to carve-out adjustments reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements. On pro forma basis, after giving effect to the Transactions, our Guarantor Subsidiaries will account
for the substantial majority of our liabilities, including the liabilities associated with the Notes and our new senior
secured credit facilities.

**Terms of the Notes**

The Notes will be joint and several, senior unsecured obligations of the Issuers. The Notes will mature on
, 2026. Each Dollar and Euro Note will bear interest at the respective rates per annum shown on the
front cover of this offering memorandum from, 2018, or from the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually to holders of record at the close of business on the
or immediately preceding the interest payment date on and of each year, commencing
, 2019. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

**Paying agent and registrar for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain a paying agent and registrar for the Dollar Notes in the United States (the “Dollar
_Notes Paying Agent”). The Trustee will initially act as the Dollar Notes Paying Agent for the Dollar Notes. The_
Issuers will maintain a paying agent and registrar for the Euro Notes in a city to be determined (the “Euro Notes
_Paying Agent” and, together with the Dollar Notes Paying Agent, the “Paying Agents” and each a “Paying_
_Agent”). The Issuers will ensure, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, that they maintain a paying agent_
in the United Kingdom or a European Union member state that will not be obligated to withhold or deduct tax
pursuant to the European Union Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income in the form of
interest payments (the “Directive”). We have appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as the Euro Notes
Paying Agent. Any Issuer may change either Paying Agent or registrar under the Indenture without prior notice
to the holders of the Notes, and the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent
or registrar.

Upon written request from any of the Issuers, the registrar shall provide such Issuer with a copy of the register to
enable such Issuer to maintain a register of the Notes at its registered offices. In the event of a conflict between
any register maintained by the Dutch Co-Issuer and the register maintained by the registrar, the register
maintained by the registrar shall prevail.

**Optional redemption**

On and after, 2021, the Issuers may redeem the Dollar Notes and/or the Euro Notes, at their option,
in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date), if
redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on of the years set forth below:

In addition, at any time prior to, 2021, the Issuers may redeem the Notes at their option, in whole at
any time or in part from time to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of
the redemption notice, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption

-----

date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2021, upon notice as
described under “—Selection and notice,” the Issuers may redeem (a) up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Dollar Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of Additional Dollar Notes of such
series) and/or (b) up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (calculated after giving effect to
any issuance of Additional Euro Notes), with an aggregate amount less than or equal to the cash proceeds less
any underwriting spread paid in cash of one or more Equity Offerings, to the extent (in the case of an Equity
Offering by a direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer) that such cash proceeds thereof are contributed to
the common equity capital of the Dutch Co-Issuer or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified
Stock) of the Dutch Co-Issuer through an issuance of Capital Stock by the Dutch Co-Issuer, at a redemption price
(expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof) equal to % (in the case of the Dollar Notes)
and % (in the case of the Euro Notes), in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not
including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive
interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date); provided, however,
that, (A) in the case of the Dollar Notes, at least the lesser of (i) 50% of the original aggregate principal amount
of the Dollar Notes (excluding any Additional Dollar Notes) and (ii) $300 million aggregate principal amount of
the Dollar Notes must remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption (except to the extent
otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture) and (B) in the case of the Euro
Notes, at least the lesser of (i) 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (excluding any
Additional Euro Notes) and (ii) €300 million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes must remain outstanding
immediately after each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture); provided, further, that for purposes of calculating the principal amount of the
Notes able to be redeemed with such cash proceeds of such Equity Offering or Equity Offerings, such amount
shall include only the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the premium on such Notes to be
redeemed; provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 180 days after the date on which any such
Equity Offering is consummated.

At any time, in connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase any series of Notes (including
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (each as defined below)), if not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series are purchased by the Issuers, or any third
party purchasing or acquiring in lieu of the Issuers, the Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon notice
as described under “—Selection and Notice,” given not more than 30 days following such purchase, to redeem all
Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal to the price paid to holders
in such purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to (but not including) the redemption
date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. The
redemption date of any redemption that is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent may, in the
Issuers’ discretion, be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the
Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption may not occur and any notice with respect to such
redemption may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied
(or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed
(which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in such case). In addition, such notice of
redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Dutch
Co-Issuer by providing notice to the noteholders.

The Issuers or their affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be
made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more
tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as
the Issuers or any such affiliates may determine.

188


-----

The Notes of any series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part pursuant to the optional redemption
provisions of the Indenture described above before the Notes of any other series are optionally redeemed in full
(or at all) pursuant to such optional redemption provisions of the Indenture.

**Redemption for taxation reasons**

The Issuers may redeem the Notes, at their option, in whole, but not in part, upon giving not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption
_Date”) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant_
interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined under
“—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due or that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the
redemption or otherwise if the Issuers determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”) affecting taxation;
or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a government agency or
court of competent jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), any
Payor (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”), with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee is, or on the next
date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any
Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to such
Payor (including the appointment of a new paying agent or, where such action would be reasonable,
payment through another Payor); provided that no Payor shall be required to take any measures that in the
Issuers’ good-faith determination would result in the imposition on such person of any material legal or
regulatory burden or the incurrence by such person of additional material costs, or would otherwise result in
any material adverse consequences to such person.

In the case of any Payor, the Change in Tax Law with respect to a given Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction must
become effective on or after the later of the date of this Offering Memorandum or the date a jurisdiction becomes
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of
Additional Amounts. Prior to the publication, mailing or delivery of any notice of redemption of the Notes
pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuers will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that they are
entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to
their right so to redeem have been satisfied (including that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot
be avoided by the Payor taking reasonable measures available to it) and (b) an opinion of an independent tax
counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor would be obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a
result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it will be conclusive and
binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in
which any successor to a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any
political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any
termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Withholding taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor in interest to any of the
foregoing (each, a “Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding

189


-----

or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other similar
governmental charge (collectively, “Taxes”) unless such withholding or deduction is required by law. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority
thereof or therein having the power to tax) from or through which payment on the Notes or any Guarantee is
made by such Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax) in which a Payor that actually makes a payment on the
Notes or its Guarantee is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise
considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof
or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required from any payments
made with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or
premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional
_Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of such payments by the_
noteholders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts that would have been received
in respect of such payments on the Notes or the Guarantees in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant noteholder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant noteholder, if such noteholder is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including
being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment
in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Notes or the receipt of any
payment or exercise of any right in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied if the holder of the Note had, to the extent
legally entitled to do so, complied with a reasonable request in writing of the Payor (such request being
made at a time that would enable such holder acting reasonably to comply with that request) to make a
declaration of nonresidence or any other claim or filing or satisfy any certification, identification,
information or reporting requirement for exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, withholding to which it
is entitled (provided that such declaration of nonresidence or other claim, filing or requirement is required
by the applicable law, treaty, regulation or official administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any
such Taxes);

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Notes or
any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially
more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any
agreements entered into pursuant thereto, and any intergovernmental agreements implementing the
foregoing (including any legislation or other official guidance relating to such intergovernmental
agreements) (“FATCA”); or

(6) any combination of the above.

190


-----

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the
holder (provided that notice of such payment is given to the holders) or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the
Note been the holder of the Note, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled to payment of Additional
Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) through (6) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law.
The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any
Taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing authority of each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing
such Taxes and will provide such certified copies to the Trustee. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Payor to
obtain such receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Payor will provide the Trustee with other evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Such receipts or other evidence will be made available by the Trustee to
holders on written request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on the
Notes, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the paying
agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable
and such other information necessary to enable the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the
relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the
relevant payment date, in which case the Payor shall deliver such Officer’s Certificate and such other information
as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date, but no less than five Business
Days prior thereto, and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of DTC).

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee or this “Description of Notes” there is mention of, in any
context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or
similar Taxes that arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale,
registration or enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(other than a transfer of the Notes), payable due to a registration, submission or filing by a party of any Notes, the
Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto where such registration, submission or filing is
or was not required to maintain or preserve the rights of the party under such documents. The foregoing
obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis
_mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business_
for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or taxing
authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Agreed tax treatment**

The portion of the proceeds of the Dollar Notes and Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date that will be borrowed by
the U.S. Co-Issuer, the portion of the proceeds of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes issued on the Issue Date

191


-----

that will be borrowed by the Dutch Co-Issuer and the portion of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes issued on
the Issue Date that will be borrowed by the Swedish Co-Issuer (upon accession as Co-Issuer) shall be posted after
the consummation of the Acquisition on the website of any of the Issuers, a direct or indirect parent of such
Issuers or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by any of the Issuers, a direct or indirect
parent of the Issuers or a third party, in the manner described under “—Certain covenants—Reports and other
information,” in a notice setting forth such amounts. Any subsequent changes to such allocation shall promptly
be posted in one of the same manners. Each Issuer intends to repay the interest and principal associated with the
portion, if any, it will borrow. Although the Notes are co-issued by the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Dutch Co-Issuer, and
after its accession as an obligor under the Indenture, the Swedish Co-Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer is liable
for repayment of the Notes in their entirety, for tax purposes the Issuers agree, and by acquiring an interest in the
Notes each beneficial owner of a Note agrees, to treat for U.S. federal income tax purposes the U.S. Co-Issuer,
the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer, respectively, as the issuer of only the portion, if any, of the debt
borrowed by each such Issuer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Issuer or any other Payor may withhold from
any interest payment made on any Note to or for the benefit of any person who is not a “United States person,” as
such term is defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, U.S. federal withholding tax (including any
withholding imposed under FATCA), and pay such withheld amounts to the Internal Revenue Service, unless
such person provides documentation to such Issuer or other Payor such that an exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax (including any withholding imposed under FATCA) would apply to such payment if interest on
such Note were treated entirely as income from sources within the United States for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; provided that the foregoing shall not limit any of the Issuers’ obligations hereunder to pay Additional
Amounts.

**Mandatory redemption**

Except as set forth under the heading “—Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption,” the Issuers will
not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Escrow of proceeds; special mandatory redemption**

This offering is expected to be consummated on, 2018, which may be prior to the Acquisition Date. If
this offering closes prior to the Acquisition Date, substantially concurrently with the closing of the offering of the
Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuers will enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent,
pursuant to which the Issuers will (x) deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the
Dollar Notes (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively the “Dollar Escrowed
_Funds”) into the Dollar Escrow Account and (y) deposit an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the_
offering of the Euro Notes (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively the “Euro
_Escrowed Funds”, and together with the Dollar Escrow Funds, the “Escrowed Funds”) into the Euro Escrow_
Account. The Issuers will grant the Trustee, (x) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the other Agents
and the holders of the Dollar Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Dollar Escrow Account and all deposits
and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the Dollar Notes pending disbursement as described
below and (y) for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the other Agents and the holders of the Euro
Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Euro Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to
secure the Obligations under the Euro Notes pending disbursement as described below.

Upon a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuers will be required to (x) fund the accrued and unpaid interest
owing to the holders of the Dollar Notes to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as
defined below) and (y) fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of the Euro Notes to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, plus, in each case, the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the
Escrow Agent and the other Agents. Prior to the Acquisition, the Issuers will have very limited assets other than
the Escrowed Funds and no operations. The Escrowed Funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this
offering of the Notes (and any earnings thereon and investments thereof). As a result, the Carlyle Fund will issue
an irrevocable equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) to the Dutch Co-Issuer, for the benefit
of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the other Agents and the holders of the Notes of each series, that will require

192


-----

the Carlyle Fund, upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to (x) transfer an amount of cash
in U.S. dollars to the Dutch Co-Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the Dollar Escrowed Funds
at such time, to fund the redemption of all of the Dollar Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon,
pursuant to such Special Mandatory Redemption and (y) transfer an amount of cash in Euros to the Dutch
Co-Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the Euro Escrowed Funds at such time, to fund the
redemption of all of the Euro Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, pursuant to such Special
Mandatory Redemption, plus, in each case, fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the other
Agents. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the notes and our indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is
_not consummated on or prior to the outside date or the Acquisition Agreement is terminated at any time prior_
_thereto, the notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the_
_return you expect on the notes.”_

The Issuers will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the Escrowed
Funds (the “Escrow Release”) to the Issuers upon the presentation by the Dutch Co-Issuer of an Officer’s
Certificate (the “Escrow Release Officer’s Certificate”) addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or
prior to May 2, 2019 (the “Outside Date”), certifying that, substantially concurrently with (or promptly
following) the Escrow Release, the Acquisition will be consummated (the “Escrow Condition”).

In the event that (a) the Acquisition Date does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time prior
to the Outside Date, the Escrow Condition is deemed, in the good faith judgment of the Issuers, to be incapable
of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition (any such event
being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuers will redeem each series of Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) no later than three business days following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or otherwise in_
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable) (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date”) at a price equal to (x) with respect to the Dollar Notes, 100% of the initial issue_
price of the Dollar Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the Dollar Notes, if any, from the Issue Date to the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Dollar Special Mandatory Redemption Price”) and (y) with respect to
the Euro Notes, 100% of the initial issue price of the Euro Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the Euro
Notes if any, from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Euro Special Mandatory
_Redemption Price”), in each case, subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive_
interest due on the relevant interest payment date.

As long as Dollar Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the Escrow
Agent at the Issuers’ written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written instruction, the
Dollar Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested in cash. As
long as Euro Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the Escrow Agent at
the Issuers’ written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written instruction, the Euro
Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested in cash.

“Eligible Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities: (1) investment in obligations issued or
guaranteed by the United States government or any agency thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the
Outside Date, (2) demand deposits, including interest bearing money market accounts, time deposits, trust funds,
trust accounts, overnight bank deposits, interest-bearing deposits, and certificates of deposit or bankers
acceptances of depository institutions in each case maturing no later than the Outside Date, (3) investments in
commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and having, at the date of acquisition, a credit rating
no lower than A-1 from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, P-1 from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or F-1
from Fitch Ratings Ltd., (4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a
nationally recognized broker-dealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or
guaranteed by the United States government or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered
into pursuant to written agreements and (5) investment in money market mutual funds having a rating in the

193


-----

highest investment category granted thereby from S&P or Moody’s, including those for which the Trustee or an
affiliate receives and retains a fee for services provided to the fund, whether as a custodian, transfer agent,
investment advisor or otherwise.

If a Mandatory Redemption Event occurs, the Escrow Agent shall promptly liquidate the Dollar Escrow Funds
and the Euro Escrow Funds and, on or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, release (x) an amount of
Dollar Escrowed Funds to the Trustee equal to the Dollar Special Mandatory Redemption Price and after
payment of any amounts due to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the other Agents, any remaining amount of
Dollar Escrowed Funds to the Issuers and (y) an amount of Euro Escrowed Funds to the Euro Notes Paying
Agent equal to the Euro Special Mandatory Redemption Price and after payment of any amounts due to the
Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the other Agents, any remaining amount of Euro Escrowed Funds to the Issuers.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes of
each series without the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of each series of Notes
outstanding. To the extent such provisions relate to the Issuers’ obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special
Mandatory Redemption, no provisions of the Indenture may be waived or modified in any manner materially
adverse to the holders of the Notes of each series without the written consent of all the holders of each series of
Notes. By its acceptance of a Note, each holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the Trustee and
the Escrow Agent to enter into and perform its obligations, if any, under the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

The Issuers are limited purpose entities. If this offering closes prior to the Acquisition Date, prior to the
Acquisition Date, the Issuers’ primary activities will be restricted to issuing the Notes and engaging in other
financing activities related to the Acquisition, issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions from
direct and indirect parent companies of the Issuers, performing its obligations in respect of the Notes under the
Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, performing their obligations under the Acquisition Agreement,
consummating the Acquisition and the Escrow Release and redeeming the Notes, if applicable, and conducting
such other activities (including financing activities) as are necessary, advisable or appropriate to carry out the
activities described above or related to the Transactions. Prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Issuers will not
own, hold or otherwise have any interest in any material assets other than the Escrow Accounts, Eligible Escrow
Investments, cash and Cash Equivalents and their rights under the documentation relating to the Transactions,
including the Acquisition Agreement, the Indenture and the Notes and other financing related documents.

If this offering closes prior to the Acquisition Date, prior to the Acquisition Date, the Issuers shall not engage in
any activity or enter into any transaction or agreement (including, without limitation, making any restricted
payment, incurring any debt (except the Notes), incurring any Liens except in favor of the Escrow Agent,
Trustee, the other Agents and/or the holders of the Notes, entering into any merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of their assets or engaging in any transaction with their Affiliates) except in the ordinary course
of business or necessary, advisable or appropriate to effectuate the Transactions (including the Acquisition, the
Equity Contribution, the Escrow Release and the initial borrowing under the Senior Credit Agreement) and the
transactions relating thereto.

Prior to the Acquisition Date, the Specialty Chemicals Entities will not be parties to the Indenture and will not be
controlled by the Issuers; accordingly, prior to the Acquisition Date, the Specialty Chemicals Entities will not be
subject to the restrictions, agreements or covenants in the Indenture.

**Selection and notice**

In the case of any partial redemption of any series of Notes, selection of the Notes of such series for redemption
will be made by the applicable Paying Agent in compliance with the requirements of the securities exchange, if
any, on which such Notes are listed (so long as such Paying Agent knows of such listing), or if such Notes are

194


-----

not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as such Paying Agent shall deem fair and
appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of (i) global
Dollar Notes, the procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”)) in minimum denominations of
$150,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) global Euro Notes, the procedures of
Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”) in minimum
denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof; provided that the selection of
Notes of any series for redemption shall not result in a holder of Notes with a principal amount of Notes less than
the applicable minimum denomination. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, the notice of
purchase or redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been
or is to be purchased or redeemed. Subject to the terms and procedures set forth under “Book entry, delivery and
form,” a new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the
holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to
accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption so long as the Issuers have deposited with the
applicable Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Notes to be redeemed.

Notices of redemption will be delivered at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each
holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior
to the redemption date if (a) the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or more conditions precedent,
the date of redemption is extended as permitted in the Indenture.

**Change of control**

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each, a “Change of Control”) after the Issue Date, each
holder will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase
price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
purchase date), except to the extent the Issuers have previously elected to redeem all of the Notes as described
under “—Optional redemption”:

(1) any person or “group” (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the
date hereof, but excluding any employee benefit plan and any person or entity acting in its capacity as
trustee, agent or other fiduciary or administrator of any such plan), other than one or more Permitted
Holders, acquires beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the Voting Stock (measured by reference to
voting power) of the Dutch Co-Issuer (determined on a fully diluted basis); or

(2) the sale, lease or transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more
Permitted Holders,

_provided that, in no case shall a Change of Control be deemed to have occurred if such Change of Control is_
also a Specified Change of Control Event.

Prior to or within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have
exercised their right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional redemption,” the Issuers shall
deliver a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee and the paying
agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable,
describing:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred or, if the Change of Control Offer is being made in advance of a
Change of Control, that a Change of Control is expected to occur, and that such holder has, or upon such

195


-----

occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuers to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not
including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest
on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date);

(2) the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, such Change of Control;

(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days (unless delivered in
advance of the occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change
_of Control Payment Date”);_

(4) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(5) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for
payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(6) that holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required
to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such
Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the
close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(7) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to
purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the
Change of Control Offer, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the
holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is
withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased;

(8) that if a holder (other than a holder of a global note) is tendering for purchase less than all of its Notes,
the Issuers will issue new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased
portion of the Notes surrendered and the unpurchased portion of the (i) Dollar Notes must be equal to
$150,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) Euro Notes must be equal to €100,000
or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be
permitted by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable);

(9) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control;

(10) the other instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow
in order to have its Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer, a holder of the Notes may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes to be
made through the facilities of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in accordance with the rules and
regulations thereof.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and
purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.
Additionally, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuers have previously
issued a notice of a full redemption pursuant to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional
redemption.”

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change
of Control.

196


-----

The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and
any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To
the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the
Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached
their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuers or portions thereof validly tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation the Notes so
accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have
been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers.

This Change of Control purchase provision is a result of negotiations between the Issuers and the Initial
Purchasers. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control (other
than the Transactions), although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the
limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including asset sales,
equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control
under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise
affect the Issuers’ capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness
are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness
and issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in
the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will
not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The Senior Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of
Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the
Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could
attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such
consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would
constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Senior
Credit Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would
constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the
Issuers experience a Change of Control that triggers a default under the Senior Credit Agreement, we could seek
a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Senior Credit Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a
waiver or refinance the Senior Credit Agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the
Senior Credit Agreement being declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to
require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such senior Indebtedness, even if the
Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuers.

The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by
the Issuers’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available
when necessary to make any required purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the notes and our
_indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control.”_

197


-----

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or
substantially all” of the assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other
than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially
all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a
holder of Notes to require the Issuers to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of
the assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be
uncertain. See “Risk factors—Risks related to the Notes and our indebtedness—Holders of the Notes may not be
able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred
following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.” In addition, the definition of “Change of Control” and
“Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Issuers in a transaction which is a
Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer.

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any
time (including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets and property that results in the receipt of
“Distributable Asset Sale Proceeds” will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the
Indenture.

**Certain covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue
Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default (other
than any Default that would not constitute a Default following a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below))
has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), (x) the Guarantees will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged and (y) the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended
_Covenants”):_

(1) “—Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness and issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock;”

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments;”

(3) “—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Subsidiaries;”

(4) “—Asset sales;”

(5) “—Change of control;”

(6) “—Transactions with Affiliates;”

(7) upon the making of the election described under the second paragraph under “—Liens,” the first
paragraph under “—Liens;”

(8) “—Future Guarantors;” and

(9) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially
all assets.”

In the event that, after a Covenant Suspension Date, the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from
two of the Rating Agencies (the date of such event, the “Reversion Date”), then the Dutch Co-Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with
respect to future events.

198


-----

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to
in this description as the “Suspension Period.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount
of Excess Proceeds from Net Cash Proceeds shall be reset at zero. With respect to Restricted Payments made
after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments made will be calculated as though the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect prior to, but not during, the
Suspension Period. No Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary during the Suspension
Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
Restricted Payments” as if such covenant were in effect during such period. In addition, all Indebtedness
Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have
been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” In addition, (i) for purposes
of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into
by the Dutch Co-Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Dutch Co-Issuer during the
Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (5) of the
second paragraph of “—Transactions with Affiliates,” (ii) for purposes of the covenant described under
“—Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the
Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such
covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and
other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries,” and (iii) for purposes of the covenant described under
“—Liens,” any Lien incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have
been entered into pursuant to clause (7) of the definition of Permitted Liens. In addition, any Change of Control
during such Suspension Period shall not require a Change of Control Offer during or after the Suspension Period;
_provided that if the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control occurs during a_
Suspension Period and the Notes are rated below Investment Grade by either of the Rating Agencies during the
period commencing 90 days prior to such notice until the end of the 90 day period following such notice (which
90 day period shall be extended so long as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for
possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies) then the Issuers shall be required to make a Change of
Control Offer upon the Reversion Date.

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or “Permitted Liens”
to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock
and Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since
the Issue Date and during the Suspension Period.

In addition, during the Suspension Period, the Guarantees will be automatically released and the obligation to
grant further Guarantees will be suspended. Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Guarantees
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Future Guarantors” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will
be deemed to be the date on which Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement or Certain Capital Markets
Debt was Incurred or guaranteed, as applicable, for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future
Guarantors”).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed
to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension
Period and the Dutch Co-Issuer and any Subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer will be permitted, without causing a
Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement
thereof) under the Indenture, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or
obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby; provided that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the
making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and if not
permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the
first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for
purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero).

199


-----

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

One of the Issuers shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant
Suspension Event or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or
verify if such events have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the
Suspension Period on the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants
or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness and issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Indenture will provide that the Dutch Co-Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any
shares of Disqualified Stock, and the Dutch Co-Issuer will not permit any of its Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries to
issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Dutch Co-Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiaries
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any NonGuarantor may issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case if (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Dutch
Co-Issuer, as of the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is issued, is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00, or (2) the Total Net Leverage Ratio for the
Dutch Co-Issuer, as of the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is issued, is less than or equal to 6.50 to 1.00 (such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock Incurred or issued pursuant to this subclause (2), or pursuant to subclause (1), “Ratio Debt”); provided,
further, that the aggregate amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) Incurred and Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the foregoing by Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries shall not exceed the
greater of (x) $520 million and (y) 47.5 % of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, at any one time outstanding.

The foregoing limitations will not apply to (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(a) The Incurrence or issuance by the Dutch Co-Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness under
any Credit Agreement, the guarantees thereof and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’
acceptances and ancillary facilities thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed
to have a principal amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an aggregate principal amount at any
time outstanding not to exceed any or all of the following amounts:

(i) the Acquisition Date Dollar Term Loan Amount (Denominated in Dollars);

(ii) the Acquisition Date Euro Term Loan Amount;

(iii) the Acquisition Date Revolving Facility Amount (Denominated in Dollars);

(iv) the Cash Capped Grower Amount; and

(v) an amount of additional Indebtedness that does not exceed the Maximum Incremental Leverage
Amount.

_provided that any calculation under subclause (v) will give pro forma effect to the Incurrence of_
Indebtedness on such date under subclauses (i) and (ii) (other than, in each case, any Basket Reduction
Amount Indebtedness) but not to any other Incurrence of Indebtedness on such date in reliance on any nonratio-based basket set forth in the Indenture, including under this clause (a); provided, further that any
Indebtedness Incurred under this clause (a) (other than Basket Reduction Amount Indebtedness) shall be
required to first be Incurred against availability under subclauses (i) and (ii) of this clause (a) prior to being
Incurred against availability under any other subclause of this clause (a).

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuers and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes (not including
any Additional Notes) and the Guarantees thereof, as applicable;

(c) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred
Stock of its Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Acquisition Date or on any Reversion Date (excluding, in

200


-----

each case, Indebtedness described in clause (a) or (b) above that is Incurred or existing (or deemed to be
Incurred or existing) on the Acquisition Date or any Reversion Date, but, for the avoidance of doubt,
including all Capitalized Lease Obligations (after giving effect to IFRS 16) existing on the Acquisition Date
or any Reversion Date);

(d) Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Capitalized Lease Obligations and mortgage financings as

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the
categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred or issued as Ratio Debt, the Issuers shall, in their sole
discretion, at the time of Incurrence or issuance, divide, classify or reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify
or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any
manner that complies with this covenant, provided that (x) all Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement
Incurred on or prior to the Acquisition Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred, in the case of the Dollardenominated term loans borrowed on or prior to the Acquisition Date, pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the definition
of “Permitted Debt,” in the case of the Euro-denominated term loans borrowed on or prior to the Acquisition
Date, pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” and, in the case of the revolving portion of
the Senior Credit Agreement, pursuant to clause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and the Dutch
Co-Issuer shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of the Indebtedness Incurred on or prior to the
Acquisition Date pursuant to clause (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and (y) the entire
committed amount of the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Agreement on the Acquisition Date shall be
deemed to have been Incurred on the Acquisition Date pursuant to subclause (a)(iii) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt” as if such entire committed amount were outstanding funded Indebtedness in the amount of
such commitment on the Acquisition Date and such entire committed amount of the revolving portion of the
Senior Credit Agreement shall be deemed to constitute outstanding funded Indebtedness in the amount of such
commitment from and after the Acquisition Date under subclause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”
irrespective of the actual funded borrowings thereunder, it being understood that (1) actual revolving borrowings
and ancillary facilities in respect of (and not in excess of) such entire committed amount deemed to be
outstanding may be drawn and redrawn on any subsequent date without further testing under this covenant and
(2) any subsequent permanent reductions in such committed amount shall be deemed to correspondingly reduce
the amount of Indebtedness Incurred and outstanding under such subclause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted
Debt” in respect of such committed amount. Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the
accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form
of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of liquidation
preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing
Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating
to, Indebtedness that are otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not
be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the
Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this
covenant.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw
facility or other committed debt financing Incurred under such ratio based basket, the Dutch Co-Issuer may elect,
at any time (which election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), to either (x) give pro forma
effect to the Incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness, in which case such committed
amount may thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, without further
compliance with any ratio-based component of any provision of the Indenture, or (y) give pro forma effect to the
Incurrence of the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other
committed debt financing, in which case, the ability to Incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness
will be subject to the ratio-based basket (to the extent being Incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each
such Incurrence. The Dutch Co-Issuer hereby elects that on the Acquisition Date, the entire committed amount of
the revolving portion of the Senior Credit Agreement on the Acquisition Date shall be deemed to have been
Incurred under subclause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and not under any ratio-based basket.
Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary unless the Dutch Co-Issuer elects otherwise, if, on any
date, the Dutch Co-Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related
transactions (A) Incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as permitted by a ratio-based
basket and (B) Incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under a non-ratio-based
basket (other than any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (a)(i) or (a)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted
Debt” that is not Basket Reduction Amount Indebtedness), then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such
date with respect to any Incurrence under the applicable ratio-based basket without giving effect for the
Incurrence under such non-ratio-based basket made in connection with such transaction or series of related
transactions.

Additionally, for purposes of complying with this covenant, any obligation, including any lease, concession or
license of property (or guarantee thereof), that would not constitute a Capitalized Lease Obligation under IFRS as
in effect as of the Issue Date (which for the avoidance of doubt would not give effect to the application of IFRS
16) will be “Permitted Debt”.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount or
liquidation preference, as applicable, of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a
foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the
lower Dollar-equivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition, or first
issued in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as
the case may be, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed
the principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing Expenses).

The principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which
such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of
such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely
because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it
has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Indenture will provide that the Dutch Co-Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests, including any payment made in connection with any
merger, amalgamation or consolidation involving the Dutch Co-Issuer (other than (A) dividends or
distributions by the Dutch Co-Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the
Dutch Co-Issuer; or (B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted

Subsidiary receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity
Interests in such class or series of securities);

Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer, including in connection with any merger,

in each case, prior to any scheduled repayment, sinking fund payment or maturity, any Subordinated
Indebtedness of any of the Issuers or any Guarantor (other than the payment, redemption, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition or retirement of (A) Subordinated Indebtedness of any of the Issuers or any
Guarantor in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in
each case due within one year of the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition
or retirement and (B) Indebtedness permitted under clause (g) or (i) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”);

Dutch Co-Issuer in good faith) or (ii) such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any agreement or
instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Senior Credit Agreement as of the
Acquisition Date (as determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer in good faith);

(12) any encumbrance or restriction contained in Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred
pursuant to the covenants described under “—Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness and issuance of
Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Liens” to the extent limiting the right of the debtor to
dispose of the assets securing such Indebtedness;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to
any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) detract from the value of the property
or assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Dutch Co-Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary or (y) materially affect the Issuers’ ability to make future principal or interest
payments on the Notes, in each case, as determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer in good faith;

(14) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar agreements or
arrangements relating solely to the applicable joint venture; and

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) in the first paragraph
of this covenant imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred
to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) through (14) of this second paragraph of this covenant; provided
that such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such amendment, modification, restatement,
renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing are, in the good faith judgment of the
Dutch Co-Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and restrictions
prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement
or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving
dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock

216


-----

shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination
of loans or advances made to the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by
the Dutch Co-Issuer or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make
loans or advances.

**_Asset sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Dutch Co-Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, receives consideration
(including by way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities,
contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as
determined at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed
of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor received by the
Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash
Equivalents or Replacement Assets; provided that the amount of:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Dutch Co-Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet or in the notes thereto for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding such date or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been reflected on the Dutch Co-Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the
date of such balance sheet in the good faith determination of the Dutch Co-Issuer) of the Dutch
Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the
Notes) that are extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale, or that are
assumed by the transferee of any such assets or Equity Interests, in each case, pursuant to an agreement
that releases or indemnifies the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
from further liability;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Dutch Co-Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash
Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days of
the receipt thereof; and

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this subclause (c) that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $390 million and (y) 35.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated
EBITDA, calculated at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the
Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value);

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this clause (2).

Within 540 days after the Dutch Co-Issuer’s or any Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of
any Asset Sale, the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Applicable
Percentage of such Net Cash Proceeds (the “Applicable Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) to reduce Obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement and in the case of revolving loans, to
correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto;

217


-----

(2) to reduce Obligations under Indebtedness (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) that is secured by a
Lien, which Lien is permitted by the Indenture and, in the case of revolving loans, to correspondingly
reduce commitments with respect thereto;

(3) to reduce Obligations under (x) Pari Passu Indebtedness of the Issuers or the Guarantors (provided that if
the Issuers or any Guarantor shall so reduce such Obligations under Pari Passu Indebtedness other than the
Notes, the Issuers will (A) equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Notes as provided under
“—Optional redemption” or through open-market purchases (to the extent such purchases are at or above
100% of the principal amount thereof) or (B) make an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth
below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, the principal amount of Notes that would otherwise
be redeemed under subclause (A) above), or (y) Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary, in each case,
other than Indebtedness owed to the Dutch Co-Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of
revolving loans, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto);

(4) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, assets (other than working capital assets), or
property or capital expenditures, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business;

(5) to make an investment (including capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties (other
than working capital assets) or assets (other than working capital assets) that replace the businesses,
properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, with any such investment made by way of a
capital or other lease valued at the present value of the minimum amount of payments under such lease (as
determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer in good faith); or

(6) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the_
provisions described in clause (4) or (5) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 540 days after the Asset
Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds, the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, has
entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment in compliance with the
provision described in clauses (4) or (5) of this paragraph, and that investment is thereafter completed within 180
days after the end of such 540-day period. Such 540-day period (as may be extended pursuant to this paragraph)
shall constitute the “Proceeds Application Period”.

“Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after
giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio
would be less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.00 but greater than 3.75 to 1.00 or (2) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after
giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the Consolidated Secured Net Debt Ratio
would be less than or equal to 3.75 to 1.00.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or
utilize such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If, with respect to any Asset Sale, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset
Sale, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $250.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter
Consolidated EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $250.0 million
and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with
respect to Foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Issuers shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) no later
than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all holders of Notes and, if
required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis,
that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in

218


-----

an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued
with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or
such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other
Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuers may
satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer at any time prior
to the expiration of the application period.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise
surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in
an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined
_Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes_
and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in
an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall select the applicable Notes (and the Issuers or their agents shall select such
Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset
Sale Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any of or all the Excess Proceeds of
any Asset Sales by a Non-U.S. Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) (x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable
local law from being repatriated to Sweden, the Netherlands and to the United States or (y) would result in
adverse tax consequences, as determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer in its sole discretion, the portion of such Net
Cash Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts
may be retained by the applicable Non-U.S. Subsidiary; provided that clause (x) of this paragraph shall apply to
such amounts so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law will not permit repatriation to Sweden, the
Netherlands and to the United States (the Issuers hereby agreeing to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the applicable Non-U.S. Subsidiary to take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable
organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation to Sweden, the Netherlands or to the
United States), and if such repatriation of any of such affected Net Cash Proceeds is permitted under the
applicable local law and is not subject to clause (y) of this paragraph, then, such repatriation will be promptly
effected and such repatriated Net Cash Proceeds will be applied (net of additional taxes payable or reserved
against as a result thereof) in compliance with this covenant. The time periods set forth in this covenant shall not
start until such time as the Net Cash Proceeds may be repatriated to Sweden, the Netherlands or to the United
States (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs).

To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if
required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to
the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional
Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the
Issuers’ discretion. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any
other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the
purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by
virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as
a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified as described in the first sentence of “—Amendments and
waivers.”

The Senior Credit Agreement will prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which
the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale
Offer. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers or one of their Affiliates

219


-----

could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers or one of their Affiliates do not obtain such consent or
repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure
to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of
such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities
exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the applicable Paying Agent knows of such listing) or
if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness
tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the
minimum denomination (x) in the case of Dollar Notes of $150,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof or (y) in the case of Euro Notes of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof shall be
purchased (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable)) by lot or by such other method as the applicable Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and
in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase
shall not result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of (x) $150,000
in the case of the Dollar Notes and (y) €100,000 in the case of the Euro Notes (or, in each case, such lower
denomination as may be permitted by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable). No Note will be
repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left outstanding.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten
days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered
address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. If any
Note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the
principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased.

A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note)
purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the
purchase date, unless the Issuers default in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes
or portions thereof purchased.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets and property that results in the receipt of
“Distributable Asset Sale Proceeds” will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the
Indenture.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Indenture will provide that the Dutch Co-Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of
its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction
or series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate of the Dutch Co-Issuer involving aggregate consideration in excess of $80 million (each of the
foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Dutch Co-Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis (as
determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer); and

(b) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
consideration in excess of $365 million, any of the Issuers delivers to the Trustee a resolution adopted in
good faith by the majority of the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent

220


-----

of the Dutch Co-Issuer, approving such Affiliate Transaction, together with an Officer’s Certificate
certifying that the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch
Co-Issuer determined or resolved that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above.

The foregoing provisions will not apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Dutch Co-Issuer and/or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or an
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger,
amalgamation or consolidation of the Dutch Co-Issuer and any Holdings Entity or any other direct or
indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer; provided that such Holdings Entity or such parent entity shall have
no material liabilities and no material assets (other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the
Dutch Co-Issuer) and such merger, amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the
terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide business purpose;

(2) (a) Restricted Payments permitted by the Indenture and (b) Permitted Investments (other than Permitted
Investments under clause (13) of the definition thereof);

(3) transactions in which the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to
the Dutch Co-Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements
of clause (a) of the preceding paragraph;

(4) payments, loans, advances or guarantees (or cancellation of loans, advances or guarantees) to employees,
officers, directors, managers, consultants or independent contractors for bona fide business purposes or in
the ordinary course of business;

(5) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Acquisition Date or any Reversion Date (other than
any Management Agreement) or as thereafter amended, supplemented or replaced (so long as such
amendment, supplement or replacement agreement or arrangement is not materially disadvantageous (as
determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer) to the holders of the Notes when taken as a whole as
compared to the original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Acquisition Date) or any transaction
or payments contemplated thereby;

(6) the Management Agreements or any transaction or payments (including reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses or payments under any indemnity obligations) contemplated thereby;

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of, the Acquisition Agreement, any stockholders or similar agreement (including
any registration rights agreement or purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party entered into as
of the Acquisition Date or in connection with the Transactions or similar transactions, arrangements or
agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance
by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under, any future amendment
to any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement or under any similar transaction, arrangement or
agreement entered into after the Acquisition Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that
the terms of any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement, together with all amendments thereto,
taken as a whole, or new transaction, arrangement or agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous (as
determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer) to the holders of the Notes, in any material respect when
taken as a whole as compared with the original transaction, arrangement or agreement as in effect on the
Acquisition Date or entered into in connection with the Transactions;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case,
in the ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, which are
fair to the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or are on terms at least as favorable (as
determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any

221


-----

direct or indirect parent of the DutchCo-Issuer) as might reasonably have been obtained at such time from
an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Qualified Receivables
Factoring;

(10) the sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Dutch Co-Issuer;

which payments are (x) made pursuant to agreements with the Sponsor or (y) approved by a majority of the

faith or a majority of the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any

out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Sponsor or a direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer in
connection therewith);

(13) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an Affiliate
Transaction solely because the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in or
otherwise controls such Person; provided that no Affiliate of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise
participate in such Person;

(14) transactions between the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that
would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because such Person is a director, or such Person has a

(19) (i) any employment, consulting, service or termination agreement, or customary indemnification
arrangements, entered into by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries with current, former
or future officers, directors, employees, managers, consultants and independent contractors of the Dutch
Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or of any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer to
the extent such agreements or arrangements are in respect of services performed for the Dutch Co-Issuer or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries), (ii) any subscription agreement or similar agreement pertaining to the
repurchase of Equity Interests pursuant to put/call rights or similar rights with current, former or future

**_Liens_**

The Indenture will provide that prior to a Covenant Suspension Event, following any Reversion Date and during
any Suspension Period when there is no election by the Issuers pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, the
Issuers will not, and will not permit any Guarantor to, directly or indirectly, create or Incur any Lien securing
Indebtedness (other than Permitted Liens) on any asset or property of any of the Issuers or any Guarantor, unless
(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Notes and any applicable Guarantee are secured
by a Lien on such property or assets and the proceeds thereof that is senior in priority to such Liens; or (2) in all
other cases, the Notes and the applicable Guarantee are secured by a Lien on such property or assets and the
proceeds thereof equally and ratably with or prior to such Liens.

223


-----

Following a Covenant Suspension Event, the Issuers may elect by written notice to the Trustee to be subject to an
alternative covenant with respect to the limitation on Liens in lieu of the preceding paragraph (the date such
notice is delivered, the “Election Date”). Under this alternative covenant, from and after an Election Date and
until a Reversion Date, the Issuers will not, and will not permit any of the Dutch Co-Issuer’s Principal Property
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, Incur any Lien securing Indebtedness upon any (1) Restricted
Property or (2) shares of Capital Stock or evidence of Indebtedness for borrowed money issued by any Principal
Property Subsidiary, whether owned at the Acquisition Date or thereafter acquired, without making effective
provision, and the Issuers in such case will make or cause to be made effective provision, whereby the Notes and
the applicable Guarantees shall be secured by such Lien equally and ratably with any and all other Indebtedness
or obligations thereby secured, so long as such Indebtedness or obligations shall be so secured; provided,
_however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any of the following:_

(1) Liens that exist on the date of the Covenant Suspension Event;

(2) Liens on property, shares of Capital Stock or evidence of Indebtedness of any corporation existing at the
time such corporation becomes a Guarantor;

(3) Liens in favor of an Issuer or any Guarantor;

(4) Liens in favor of governmental bodies to secure progress, advance or other payments pursuant to
contract or statute or Indebtedness incurred to finance all or a part of construction of or improvements to
property subject to such Liens;

(5) Liens (i) on property, shares of Capital Stock or evidences of Indebtedness for borrowed money existing
at the time of acquisition thereof (including acquisition through merger, amalgamation or consolidation),
and construction and improvement Liens that are entered into within one year from the date of such
construction or improvement; provided that in the case of construction or improvement the Lien shall not
apply to any property theretofore owned by an Issuer or any Guarantor except substantially unimproved real
property on which the property so constructed or the improvement is located and (ii) for the acquisition of
any real property, which Liens are created within 180 days after the completion of such acquisition to secure
or provide for the payment of the purchase price of the real property acquired; provided that with respect to
clauses (i) and (ii), any such Liens do not extend to any other property of the Issuers or any of the
Guarantors (whether such property is then owned or thereafter acquired);

(6) mechanics’, landlords’ and similar Liens arising in the ordinary course of business in respect of
obligations not due or being contested in good faith;

(7) Liens for taxes, assessments, or governmental charges or levies that are not delinquent or are being
contested in good faith;

(8) Liens arising from any legal proceedings that are being contested in good faith;

(9) any Liens that (i) are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties
and assets, including Liens incurred in connection with workmen’s compensation, unemployment insurance
or other forms of governmental insurance or benefits, or to secure performance of tenders, statutory
obligations, leases and contracts, (ii) were not incurred in connection with the borrowing of money or the
obtaining of advances or credit and (iii) do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of the
property of the Issuers or any Guarantor or materially impair the use thereof in the operation of its business;
and

(10) Liens for the sole purpose of extending, renewing or replacing in whole or in part any of the foregoing.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, during any Suspension Period, if the
Election Date has occurred, the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Subsidiary may, without equally and ratably securing the
Notes and the Guarantees, create or assume Liens that would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions if
at the time of such creation or assumption, and after giving effect thereto, Exempted Indebtedness does not
exceed 10% of Consolidated Total Assets.

224


-----

Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes or the applicable Guarantee pursuant to the preceding paragraphs
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien
that gave rise to the obligation to secure the Notes or the Guarantee under the applicable preceding paragraphs
(other than a release as a result of the enforcement of remedies in respect of such Lien or the Obligations secured
by such Lien).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such
Indebtedness. The “Increased Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such
Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms,
accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, any fees, underwriting discounts, accrued and
unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the
amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or
increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness.

**_Reports and other information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Dutch Co-Issuer will provide to the
Trustee and, upon request, to holders of the Notes a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 90 days (or, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, not later than
April 30, 2019 and April 29, 2020, respectively) after the end of each fiscal year (or such longer period as
may be permitted by the SEC if the Dutch Co-Issuer were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a
non-accelerated filer, including under Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), annual
audited financial statements for such fiscal year including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented and a report on the
annual financial statements by the Dutch Co-Issuer’s independent registered public accounting firm or the
foreign analog thereof (the “Auditor”)(all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis
substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum),

(2) within 45 days (or 105 days for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2018 and 90 days for the next two
fiscal quarters ended after the Issue Date (other than any fourth fiscal quarter)) after the end of each of the
first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or such longer period as may be permitted by the SEC if the
Dutch Co-Issuer were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a non-accelerated filer, including under
Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), unaudited financial statements for the interim
period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter including a “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (all of the foregoing financial
information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum), and

(3) within the time period specified for filing current reports on Form 8-K by the SEC, current reports that
would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Dutch Co-Issuer were required to file such
reports for any of the following events: (a) entry into material agreements; (b) the bankruptcy of the Dutch
Co-Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary, (c) the acceleration of any Indebtedness of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary having a principal amount in excess of $300 million, (d) a change in the Dutch
Co-Issuer’s certifying independent auditor (or foreign analog), (e) the appointment or departure of the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Operating Officer or President
(or persons fulfilling similar duties) of any Holdings Entity or the Dutch Co-Issuer, (f) resignation of a
director of any Holdings Entity or the Dutch Co-Issuer on disagreeable terms, (g) change in fiscal year,
(h) non-reliance on previously issued financial statements (i) change of control transactions (other than the
Transactions), and (j) significant acquisitions or dispositions (other than the Transactions); provided that no

225


-----

such current report will be required to be furnished if the Dutch Co-Issuer determines in its good faith
judgment that such event is not material to holders of the Notes or to the business, assets, operations,
financial position or prospects of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if
the Dutch Co-Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure would otherwise cause
material competitive harm to the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of the Dutch
Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, further, that such non-disclosure shall
be limited only to those specific provisions that would cause material competitive harm and not the
occurrence of the event itself;

_provided, further, however, that in addition to providing such information to the Trustee and upon request,_
holders of the Notes, the Issuers will, to the extent the requirements set forth in the last paragraph of this
covenant are satisfied, make available to the holders of the Notes, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes,
bona fide market makers in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the
extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) such information by (i) posting to the website of the Dutch
Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer or on
a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Dutch Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Swedish
Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a third party, in each case, within 15 days
after the time the Dutch Co-Issuer would be required to provide such information pursuant to clause (1), (2) or
(3) above, as applicable, or (ii) otherwise providing substantially comparable availability of such reports (as
determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such
reports available on Bloomberg or another comparable private electronic information service shall constitute
substantially comparable availability).

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) the Dutch Co-Issuer will not be required to
furnish any information, certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K or (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any non-generally accepted accounting principles
financial measures contained therein, (b) the information and reports referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the
first paragraph of this covenant will not be required to contain the separate financial statements or other
information contemplated by Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (c) to the extent
pro forma financial information is required to be provided by the Dutch Co-Issuer (including with respect to the
Transactions), the Dutch Co-Issuer may provide only pro forma revenues, net income and the cumulative effect
of accounting changes, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (if applicable), senior
secured debt, total debt and capital expenditures (or equivalent financial information) in lieu thereof, (d) the
information and reports referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be
required to present compensation or beneficial ownership information, (e) the information and reports referred to
in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to include any exhibits
required by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form 8-K (f) trade secrets and other
proprietary information may be excluded from any disclosures and (g) no required report will be required to
contain any “segment reporting”. If at any time the Dutch Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch
Co-Issuer has made a good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect to an
Equity Offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Dutch Co-Issuer will still be required to provide reports
pursuant to this covenant but the content of such reports will not be required to disclose any information that, in
the good faith view of the Dutch Co-Issuer, would violate the securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules
or otherwise have an adverse effect on such Equity Offering.

For so long as the Dutch Co-Issuer has designated certain of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then
the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will include a
reasonably detailed presentation (which need not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors), either on the face of
the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, or in the “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations” or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of

226


-----

operations of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results
of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Dutch Co-Issuer.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Dutch Co-Issuer will agree that, for so long as any
Notes are outstanding, the Dutch Co-Issuer will furnish to holders of the Notes, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any successor
provision).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information, auditors’ reports and other documents
required to be provided as described above, may be, rather than those of the Dutch Co-Issuer, those of (a) any
predecessor or successor of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this
paragraph, (b) any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer that, together with its consolidated
Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer;
_provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary of the_
Dutch Co-Issuer or such direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer, the same is accompanied by
consolidating information, which may be posted to the website of the Dutch Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the
Swedish Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer on a non-public, password-protected
website maintained by the Dutch Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the
information relating to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one
hand, and the information relating to the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis,
on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information referred to in the proviso in the
preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors. We expect to rely upon the second
preceding sentence to provide financial statements, information and other documents of (i) on a carve-out
accounting basis, the Specialty Chemicals Business or any predecessor of the Dutch Co-Issuer with respect to the
fiscal period ended prior to the date of the consummation of the Acquisition and (ii) a direct or indirect parent of
the Dutch Co-Issuer for any fiscal period ending after the Issue Date.

The Dutch Co-Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied the information and reporting requirements of the first
paragraph of this covenant if (a) the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Qualified Reporting Subsidiary of the Dutch
Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer has filed reports or registration statements
containing such information (including the information required pursuant to the first sentence of the immediately
preceding paragraph, which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be filed with the SEC via EDGAR to the extent
it is otherwise provided to holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant) with the SEC via the EDGAR (or
successor) filing system within the applicable time periods after giving effect to any extensions permitted by the
SEC and that are publicly available or (b) with respect to the holders of the Notes only, the Dutch Co-Issuer or
such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or such parent entity has made such reports available electronically
(including by posting to a non-public, password-protected website as provided above) pursuant to this covenant.
The Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether any filings have been made.

So long as Notes are outstanding, the Dutch Co-Issuer will also:

(a) promptly after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and
(2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of
operations for the relevant reporting period; and

(b) announce by press release or post to the website of the Dutch Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the
SwedishCo-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer or on a non-public, passwordprotected website maintained by the Dutch Co-Issuer, the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Swedish Co-Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a third party, which will require a confidentiality
acknowledgment (but not restrict the recipients of such information from trading securities of the Issuers or
their respective affiliates), prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with

227


-----

clause (a) of this paragraph, the time and date of such conference call and either all information necessary to
access the call or informing holders of Notes, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market
makers in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent
providing analysis of an investment in the Notes) how they can obtain such information, including, without
limitation, the applicable password or other login information;

_provided, however, that the Dutch Co-Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of clause (a) of_
this paragraph if any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer holds a conference call to discuss such
reports and the results of operations for the relevant reporting period.

Any person who requests or accesses such financial information or seeks to participate in any conference calls
required by this covenant may be required to provide its email address, employer name and other information
reasonably requested by the Issuers and represent to the Issuers (to the Issuers’ reasonable good faith satisfaction)
that:

(1) it is a holder of the Notes, a beneficial owner of the Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the Notes,
a bona fide market maker in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser or a bona fide securities analyst
providing an analysis of investment in the Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such provided information confidential and will not communicate the information to any
Person; and

(4) it (a) will not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of the Dutch
Co-Issuer and its Subsidiaries and (b) is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is
principally engaged in a Similar Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenues from operating
or owning a Similar Business.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically
cured if the Dutch Co-Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer, as the case may be, provides
all required reports to the noteholders with a copy to the Trustee or files all required reports with the SEC via the
EDGAR filing system.

**_Future Guarantors_**

If, on or after the Acquisition Date, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer (including any newly
formed, newly acquired or newly redesignated Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Receivables Subsidiary,
any CFC, any CFC Holdco, any direct or indirect Subsidiary of a CFC, the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish
Co-Issuer) that is not then an Issuer or a Guarantor (x) guarantees or borrows or issues any Indebtedness under
the Senior Credit Agreement or (y) guarantees any capital markets Indebtedness with an aggregate principal
amount in excess of the greater of (x) $300 million and (y) 28.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA
(“Certain Capital Markets Debt”) of the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or borrows or
issues Certain Capital Markets Debt or (b) any of the Issuers otherwise elects to have any Restricted Subsidiary
of the Dutch Co-Issuer (other than the U.S. Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer) become a Guarantor, then, in
each such case, the Dutch Co-Issuer shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the
Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as those set
forth in the Indenture and applicable to the other Guarantors; provided that, in the case of clause (a), such
supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered to the Trustee within 20 Business Days of the date that
such Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Agreement or such Certain Capital Markets Debt has been guaranteed,
co-borrowed or co-issued by such Restricted Subsidiary; provided further that the Restricted Subsidiaries that
become guarantors under the Senior Credit Agreement on the Acquisition Date, will enter into a supplemental
indenture and will become Guarantors on the Acquisition Date.

228


-----

In the event that any Restricted Subsidiary of the Dutch Co-Issuer has not provided a Guarantee in respect of the
Notes because such Restricted Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a CFC Holdco, or a direct or
indirect subsidiary of a CFC and on any subsequent date such Restricted Subsidiary no longer constitutes a
Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a CFC Holdco, or a direct or indirect subsidiary of a CFC but is an obligor or
guarantor with respect to the Senior Credit Agreement or Certain Capital Markets Debt, then the Dutch Co-Issuer
shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee within 20 Business Days of such
subsequent date a supplemental indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor
under the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as
those set forth in the Indenture and applicable to other Guarantors.

Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction
and defenses generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent
conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit,
capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. This includes limiting Guarantees to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such
Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law. However, such limitations may not be effective under local
law.

Each Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described
under “—Guarantees.”

**_Merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets_**

The Indenture will provide that none of the Issuers may merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into
(whether or not such Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose
of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person (other than
in connection with the Transactions) unless:

(1) such Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, merger,
amalgamation or winding up (if other than such Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is (or is the foreign analog of) a corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of
the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of any member
country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) (such Issuer or such Person, as the
case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”); provided that after giving effect to any such
consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition, (x) an
entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the
District of Columbia, shall be or become a co-issuer of the Notes and (y) an entity that is organized or
existing under the laws of the Netherlands and an entity organized under the laws of Sweden shall in each
case be or become a co-issuer of the Notes unless, in the case of this clause (y), not doing would not result
in material adverse tax consequences for the Holders or the Successor Company and/or its Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of such Issuer
under the Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

229


-----

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the
beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either:

(a) the Dutch Co-Issuer (or a Successor Company to the Dutch Co-Issuer, if applicable) would be
permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness as Ratio Debt; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Dutch Co-Issuer (or a Successor Company to the Dutch
Co-Issuer, if applicable) and its Restricted Subsidiaries would be greater than or equal to such ratio for
the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by
supplemental indenture confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Person’s Obligations under the
Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) the Dutch Co-Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental
indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture.

The Successor Company (if other than an Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes, and such Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) any of the Issuers may
consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
part of its properties and assets to any other Issuer or any Guarantor, (b) any of the Issuers may merge,
consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of such Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing such Issuer in another state of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of
Columbia or in any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) so long as the
principal amount of Indebtedness of the Dutch Co-Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby
(unless such increase is permitted by the Indenture), (c) an Issuer may convert into a corporation, partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities,
organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Issuer or the laws of the United
States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (a),
(b) and (c), if the resulting entity is not organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or
territory thereof or the District of Columbia, a co-issuer of the Notes remains in existence or is organized or
existing under such laws, (d) no Issuer or any Guarantor may change its name and (e) any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than the U.S. Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer) may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with any Issuer
so long as such Issuer is the Successor Company in such merger, amalgamation or consolidation; provided that,
in each case of clauses (a) through (e), after giving effect to the applicable consolidation, amalgamation, merger,
sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition, (x) an entity that is organized or existing under the
laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, shall be or become a co-issuer
of the Notes and (y) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the Netherlands and an entity
organized under the laws of Sweden shall in each case be or become a co-issuer of the Notes unless, in the case
of this clause (y), not doing so would not result in material adverse tax consequences for the Holders or the
Successor Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;

The Indenture will further provide that, subject to certain provisions in the Indenture governing release of a
Guarantee upon the sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, each Guarantor will not,
and the Dutch Co-Issuer will not permit any such entity to, consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or
wind up into (whether or not such entity is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any
Person (other than in connection with the Transactions): unless:

(1) (a) such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
merger, amalgamation or winding up (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited

230


-----

partnership or limited liability company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities,
organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the
United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of any member country of
the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a
Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent
to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the predecessor Guarantor (such
Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of
such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental
indenture or other documents or instruments;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(d) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to be
delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with
the Indenture; or

(2) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is made in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Asset sales” to the extent applicable on the date of the subject transaction.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be
substituted for, such Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will
automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and any Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Guarantor may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of the
Dutch Co-Issuer incorporated or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such
Guarantor in the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or in any member
country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date), so long as the principal amount of
Indebtedness of the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (unless such
increase is permitted by the Indenture), (2) a Guarantor may (a) consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or
wind up into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to, any Issuer or a Guarantor or (b) dissolve if such Guarantor sells, assigns, transfers, leases, conveys
or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another Person in compliance with
the covenant described under “—Asset sales” and after giving effect to such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or disposition and prior to such dissolution, has no or a de minimis amount of assets, (3) a Guarantor
may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, or the foreign
analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of
such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the
laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) or the laws of any
other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent
to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of such Guarantor prior to such
conversion, (4) a Guarantor may change its name and (5) any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the U.S.
Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer) may merge, amalgamate or consolidate into any Guarantor; provided, in the
case of this clause (5), that the surviving Person (i) is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited
liability company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the
laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia or the laws of any member
country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long
as a Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent
to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the predecessor Guarantor or the
laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Restricted Subsidiary or Guarantor and (ii) is or becomes a

231


-----

Guarantor upon consummation of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no restriction described under “—Merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets”
shall limit the ability of any Non-Guarantor Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary to engage in any merger,
consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Dutch Co-Issuer, which properties
and assets, if held by the Dutch Co-Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the sale of assets and property that result in the receipt of
“Distributable Asset Sale Proceeds” will not constitute “substantially all assets” for any purpose under the
Indenture.

**Defaults**

An Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on such series of Notes when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of such series of Notes when due at its Stated
Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required purchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including the U.S. Co-Issuer and the
Swedish Co-Issuer) to comply for 60 days after receipt of written notice referred to below with any of its
obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in
such series of Notes or the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture
provisions described under “—Certain covenants—Reports and other information,” such period of
continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has
been given;

(4) (x) the failure by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (including the U.S. Co-Issuer and the
Swedish Co-Issuer) to pay the principal amount of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than
Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (including the
U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer)) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or (y) the
acceleration of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing
to the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (including the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer))
by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if the total amount of such
Indebtedness unpaid at final maturity or accelerated exceeds $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary;

(6) failure by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary to pay final and non-appealable judgment or
judgments aggregating in excess of $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts that
are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent insurance companies), which judgment or
judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments
become final and, in the event such judgment or judgments are covered by insurance, an enforcement
proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or judgments or decree which is not
promptly stayed;

(7) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary (other than the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer)
ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture), or any
Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies in writing that it has any further liability under its
Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination or discharge of the
Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and such Default continues
for ten days; or

232


-----

(8) failure by the Issuers to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption as described under “ —Escrow
_of proceeds; special mandatory redemption.”_

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it
is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any
court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default with
respect to any series of Notes until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding
Notes of such series notify in writing the Issuers of the Default and such default is not cured within the time
specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of
any Issuer) occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30%
in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if
given by holders of Notes of such series) may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid
interest, on all Notes outstanding of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal,
premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain
events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the
outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of
outstanding Notes of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its
consequences. Please see “Risk factors—The right of holders of the Notes to receive the premium on the Notes
_under circumstances other than an optional redemption is unclear under applicable law.”_

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series by notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any
declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes and its
consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or
premium on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series (other than such nonpayment of principal or interest that
has become due as a result of such acceleration) or (ii) or waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture,
the Notes of such series or the Guarantees if, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver, rescission or
cancellation, as applicable, would not conflict with any judgment or decree. Upon any waiver of a Default or
Event of Default effected pursuant to clause (i) of the previous sentence with respect to any series of Notes, such
Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist with respect to such series of Notes, and any Event of Default
with respect to such series of Notes arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of
the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default
and all consequences thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the
Trustee or the holders of the Notes of such series, if prior to 30 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuers
deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for
such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount of holders thereof have rescinded or
waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the
default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee will be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the
holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss,

233


-----

liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest
when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have
requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it in respect of any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have not given the
Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of any series are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes. The
Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee
determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security or indemnification
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or
not taking such action.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes and is
actually known to the Trustee, the Trustee must deliver to each holder of the Notes of such series notice of the
Default within 90 days after it is known to the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal
of, premium (if any) or interest on any Note of such series, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the holders of the Notes of such
series. In addition, the Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days (or 145 days for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2018) after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding compliance with the
Indenture. Upon any Officer of any of the Issuers becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers
also are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or
Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time
period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are
taking or propose to take with respect thereto.

**Amendments and waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for the Dollar Notes or the Euro Notes, as applicable); provided that (x) if any such
amendment or supplement will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding
under the Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such
series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or
supplement by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner that is different from and materially adverse
relative to the manner in which such amendment or supplement affects other series of Notes, then the consent of
the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series
of the Notes) shall be required. With respect to any series of Notes, (i) any Default or Event of Default with

234


-----

respect to such series of Notes or (ii) compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or
the Guarantees may, in each case, be waived as provided in the fifth paragraph under “—Defaults.” However,
without the consent of each holder of Notes of any series of Notes, no amendment, supplement or waiver may
(with respect to any Notes of such series held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series whose holders must
consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note
of such series;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note of such series;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the
Notes of such series, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes of such series with respect to a
nonpayment default by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such
series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration;

(5) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note of such series or change the time at which
any Note of such series may be redeemed as described under “—Optional redemption” (other than, in each
case, any change to the notice periods with respect to such redemptions) or “—Redemption for taxation
reasons”;

(6) make any Note of such series payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(7) impair the right of any holder of Notes of such series to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment
on or with respect to such holder’s Notes;

(8) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or Events of
Default or the rights of holders of Notes of such series to receive payments of principal of or premium, if
any, or interest on the Notes of such series;

(9) make the Notes of such series or any Guarantee subordinated in right of payment to any other
obligations; or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions of the Indenture that require the holders’
consent as described in clauses (1) through (9) of this sentence.

A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers holds the Note;
_provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Notes, or the_
outstanding Notes of any series, have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver hereunder, Notes of such series owned by the Issuers or any Affiliate of the Issuers shall be disregarded
and deemed not to be outstanding if such ownership is known by a Trust Officer.

Without the consent of any holder of Notes of any series, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee
or the Indenture to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Notes and the Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency identified in an Officer’s Certificate
delivered to the Trustee,

(2) to conform the text of the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant
to which Additional Notes are issued), the Guarantees or the Notes of such series to this “Description of
notes” or, with respect to any Additional Notes and any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant
to which such Additional Notes are issued, to the “Description of notes” relating to the issuance of such
Additional Notes solely to the extent that such “Description of notes” provides for terms of such Additional
Notes that differ from the terms of the initial Notes, as contemplated by “—General” above,

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets,

235


-----

(4) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of an Issuer or any Guarantor
under the Indenture and the Notes of such series or Guarantee, as the case may be,

(5) to provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Notes of such
series; provided that the uncertificated Notes of such series are issued in registered form for purposes of
Section 163(f) of the Code,

(6) (A) to add or release Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture with respect to the Notes
of such series or (B) to add additional co-issuers (including, without limitation, the Swedish Co-Issuer) of
the Notes of such series to the extent it does not result in adverse tax consequences to the holders,

(7) to secure the Notes of such series,

(8) to add to the covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuers or any Guarantor,

(9) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect upon
delivery to the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate certifying the absence of such adverse effect,

(10) to comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with any qualification of the Indenture under
the TIA,

(11) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the
Notes of such series as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance
and administration of the Notes of such series; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as
so amended would not result in Notes of such series being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or
any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment does not materially and adversely affect the rights of
holders to transfer Notes of such series,

(12) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee; provided that the
successor Trustee is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture, or

(13) to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. For the avoidance
of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of “—Change of Control” or any of the covenants described under
“—Certain covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the Notes of any series to
receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes of such series, and will, for the
avoidance of doubt, require the vote of holders described in the first sentence of this “—Amendments and
waivers.”

**No personal liability of managers, directors, officers, employees and stockholders**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or holder of any equity interests in any
of the Issuers, any Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Dutch Co-Issuer, as such, will have any
liability for any obligations of the Issuers or any Guarantor under the Notes or the Indenture or any Guarantee or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of the Notes
by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for
issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and it
is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Transfer and exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange,
the registrar and the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements

236


-----

or transfer documents and the Issuers may require a noteholder to pay any taxes required by law or permitted by
the Indenture. The registrar will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption (except
in the case of a Note to be redeemed in part, the portion of such Note not to be redeemed) or to transfer or
exchange any Note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection of Notes to be redeemed or tendered and not
withdrawn or in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer. The Notes will be issued in
registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all purposes.

**Satisfaction and discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect and any collateral then securing the Notes
of a series shall be released (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, as
expressly provided for in the Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes of a series when:

(1) either (a) all the Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or
destroyed Notes of such series which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose
payment money has theretofore been deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and
thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged from such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee or the
applicable registrar for cancellation or (b) all of the Notes of such series not previously delivered to the
Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due
and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption or are to be
called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee or the applicable
registrar for the giving of notice of a full redemption by the trustee or the applicable Paying Agent (or such
entity designated (as agent) by the Trustee or the Issuers for such purpose) in the name, and at the expense,
of the Issuers, and any of the Issuers or any Guarantor have deposited or caused to be deposited in a manner
that is not revocable by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Affiliates with the applicable Paying Agent money
or U.S. Government Obligations (with respect to the Dollar Notes) or Euro-denominated European
Government Obligations (with respect to the Euro Notes) in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the
entire Indebtedness on the Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or the applicable
registrar for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series to the
date of maturity or redemption, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuers
directing the applicable Paying Agent to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption,
as the case may be;

(2) the Issuers and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums then due and payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that
all conditions precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have
been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all their obligations under the Notes of any series and the Indenture and
have each Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“legal defeasance”) and cure all thenexisting Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust (as
defined below) and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of the Notes of such series and certain rights
of the Trustee, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes of such series and to maintain a registrar and
paying agent in respect of the Notes of such series. The Issuers at any time may terminate their obligations and
those of each Guarantor under certain covenants that are described in the Indenture, including the covenants
described under “—Certain covenants,” the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer), the
judgment default provision described under “—Defaults” and the undertakings and covenants contained under
“—Change of Control” and “—Certain covenants—Merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or
substantially all assets” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (6) of the first paragraph and clause (1)(d) of the third

237


-----

paragraph thereof) (“covenant defeasance”). If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant
defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee.

The Issuers may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior exercise of their covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such series may
not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuers exercise their covenant
defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
specified in clause (3) (with respect to any Default by the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
with any of their obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain covenants”), (4), (5) (with respect
only to Significant Subsidiaries other than the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer), (6) (with respect only
to Significant Subsidiaries other than the U.S. Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer) or (7) under “—Defaults.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to any series of Notes, the Issuers must irrevocably
deposit or cause to be deposited (the “defeasance trust”) with the applicable Paying Agent (or such entity
designated as agent by the Issuers for such purpose) U.S dollars or U.S. Government Obligations (with respect to
the Dollar Notes) or Euros or Euro-denominated European Government Obligations (with respect to the Euro
Notes) (in each case sufficient in the opinion of an internationally recognized certified public accounting firm)
for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable series of Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be; provided that if such redemption is made pursuant to the provisions described in the
second paragraph under “—Optional redemption,” then: (x) the amount of Dollars or U.S. Government
Obligations (with respect to the Dollar Notes) or Euros or Euro-denominated European government obligations
(with respect to the Euro Notes) that the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited will be
determined using an assumed Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of such deposit, as calculated by the
Issuers in good faith, and (y) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited additional cash
denominated in the applicable currency in trust on the redemption date as necessary to pay the Applicable
Premium as determined on such date; provided, further, that the Issuers must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the Notes of
such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such
deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and,
in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue
Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law after the Issue Date).

**Measuring compliance**

With respect to any (x) Investment or acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction that has been
definitively agreed to or publicly announced and (y) repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with respect to which a notice of repayment (or similar notice), which may
be conditional, has been delivered, in each case for purposes of determining:

(1) whether any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that
is being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is permitted to be Incurred in compliance with the
covenant described under the caption “—Certain covenants—Limitation on incurrence of Indebtedness and
issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(2) whether any Lien being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment,
repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or to secure any such
Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred in accordance with the covenant described under the caption
“—Certain covenants—Liens” or the definition of “Permitted Liens”;

(3) whether any other transaction or action undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such
Investment, acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction or repayment, repurchase or

238


-----

refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (including any Restricted Payments,
dispositions, or designations of Restricted Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries) complies with the
covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the Notes; and

(4) any calculation of the ratios, baskets or financial metrics, including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash
Interest Expense and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings and baskets determined by reference to Consolidated Net
Income, Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets and,
whether a Default or Event of Default exists in connection with the foregoing,

(5) whether any condition precedent to the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness),
Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock, Liens, in each case that is being Incurred in connection with such
Investment, acquisition or repayment repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock is satisfied,

at the option of the Dutch Co-Issuer, the date that the definitive agreement for, or public announcement of, such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing or Incurrence of Indebtedness is entered into or
the date of any notice, which may be conditional, of such repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness
is given to the holders of such Indebtedness (the “Transaction Commitment Date”) may be used as the applicable
date of determination, as the case may be, in each case with such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and
consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition of “Pro Forma Basis” or
“Consolidated EBITDA.” For the avoidance of doubt, if the Dutch Co-Issuer elects to use the Transaction
Commitment Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any fluctuation
or change in the (i) Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior
Secured Net Debt Ratio, Consolidated Net Income, Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA,
Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings of the Dutch
Co-Issuer and (ii) the applicable exchange rate utilized in calculating compliance with any dollar-based provision
of the Indenture, from the Transaction Commitment Date to the date of consummation of such Investment,
acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, will not be taken into account for purposes
of determining whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with such Investment,
acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, or in connection with compliance by the
Dutch Co-Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any other provision of the Indenture or the Notes or
any other transaction undertaken in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or
refinancing of Indebtedness, is permitted to be Incurred and (b) until such Investment, acquisition or repayment,
repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is consummated or such definitive agreements are terminated, such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and all transactions proposed to
be undertaken in connection therewith (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens) will be given pro
forma effect when determining compliance of other transactions (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and
Liens unrelated to such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness) that are
consummated after the Transaction Commitment Date and on or prior to the date of consummation of such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and any such transactions
(including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) will be deemed to have occurred on
the date the definitive agreements are entered into or public announcement is made and deemed to be outstanding
thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement
and before the date of consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness. In addition, the Indenture will provide that compliance with any requirement relating to the
absence of a Default or Event of Default may be determined as of the Transaction Commitment Date and not as
of any later date as would otherwise be required under the Indenture.

For purposes hereof, the “Maximum Fixed Repurchase Price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that
does not have a fixed repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock as if such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which

239


-----

Consolidated Total Indebtedness shall be required to be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is
based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, such fair market
value shall be determined reasonably and in good faith by the Dutch Co-Issuer.

To the extent the date of any delivery of any document required to be delivered pursuant to any provision of the
Indenture falls on a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable date of delivery shall be deemed to be the next
succeeding Business Day.

**Concerning the Trustee**

Wilmington Trust, National Association is the Trustee under the Indenture and has been appointed by the Issuers
as registrar and a Paying Agent with regard to the Dollar Notes. We have appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch to act as Paying Agent and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as registrar, in each case, with regard to the
Euro Notes.

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor
of the Issuers, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of
any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however,
if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for
permission to continue or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available
to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default shall
occur (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of
care of a prudent person in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such
holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or
expense.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture will provide that it and the Notes (including the Consent to jurisdiction and service) and the
Guarantees will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

**Limitations on Guarantees and Direct Obligations in Sweden**

The Notes and the Indenture are subject to the following Swedish Terms and the Swedish Terms take precedent
notwithstanding any other provision in the Notes and/or the Indenture and override any other provision in the
Notes and/or the Indenture:

(i) any obligation and/or liability of the Swedish Co-Issuer and/or any Guarantor incorporated in Sweden ( a
“Swedish Guarantor”) under the Notes and/or the Indenture in respect of or in relation to, but not limited to,
any borrowing, guarantee, security, subordination, indemnity, payment, repayment, pre-payment,
reimbursement or compensation obligation, liability, obligation, waiver of any rights, release of any rights
or liabilities, obligation to pay any fees or cost and/or any other obligation or liability of itself or its
subsidiaries or any parent entity and/or parent entity’s subsidiaries or other entity shall be limited, if (and
only if) required by the provisions of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551))
regulating distribution of assets (chapter 17, sections 1-4) (or their equivalents from time to time) and
unlawful loans, security, guarantees and financial assistance (chapter 21, sections 1-5) (or its equivalent
from time to time) and it is understood and agreed that the obligations and liabilities of the Swedish
Co-Issuer and/or each Swedish Guarantor and the terms and conditions of the Notes and/or the Indenture
only apply to the extent permitted by the above mentioned provisions of the Swedish companies act;

(ii) any transfer by novation, shall, as regards security governed by Swedish law, transfer a proportionate part of
the security interests granted under the relevant Swedish law governed security together with a proportional
part of the security interest under the relevant Swedish law governed collateral documents;

(iii) any obligation for any entity incorporated in Sweden to act as trustee shall be an obligation to act as agent
and the obligation to hold assets on trust shall be an obligation not to hold such assets on trust but to hold
such assets as agent; and

(iv) any release of any security created by a security document governed by Swedish law will always be subject
to the prior written consent of the creditor or representative of the creditor.

Notwithstanding what is set out in the Notes and/or the Indenture a Swedish Co-Issuer or Swedish Guarantor will
not be a joint and several borrower/issuer or guarantor to the extent it is not permissible pursuant to the Swedish
Terms.

The circumstance or fact that no specific reference is made to or qualification is made in respect of the Swedish
Terms in the Notes and/or in the Indenture shall not mean that the Swedish Terms do not apply and override. The
Swedish Terms shall always override and no statement or reference in any document that a provision or term
shall apply notwithstanding any other provision shall apply in relation to the Swedish Terms.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Dutch Co-Issuer will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Euro Notes to be
listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, and to maintain such listing so long as
the Euro Notes are outstanding; provided that if (x) the Dutch Co-Issuer is unable to list the Euro Notes on the
Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, (y) maintenance of such listing becomes unduly
onerous, as reasonably determined by the Dutch Co-Issuer or (z) the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg
Stock Exchange requires additional financial information from the Dutch Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries than is required pursuant to “—Certain covenants—Reports and other information,” then the Dutch
Co-Issuer will, prior to the delisting of the Euro Notes from the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange (if then listed on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange), use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Euro Notes on another internationally recognized stock
exchange (in which case, references in this covenant to the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange will be deemed to be refer to such other stock exchange) that would not cause the Dutch Co-Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries to become subject to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (market abuse
regulation) and any applicable delegated regulations thereunder; provided, further, that if the Securities Official
List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any such other stock exchange requires the Issuer to publicly file or

241


-----

make available its financial statements or requires publication of any financial information from the Dutch
Co-Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, then the Dutch Co-Issuer shall not be required to maintain any
listing on the Securities Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other exchange.

**Enforceability of judgments**

Because most of the assets of the Issuers and Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in
the United States against the Issuers or certain Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium, if any, interest, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectible within the United States. See “Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees.”

**Consent to jurisdiction and service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes
(including the Consent to jurisdiction and service) and the Guarantees, the Dutch Co-Issuer, the Swedish
Co-Issuer and each Guarantor that is organized under laws other than the United States or a state thereof will in
the Indenture (1) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, United States, (2) consent that any such action or
proceeding may be brought in such courts and waive any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue
of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient court and agree not to plead or claim the same, (3) designate and appoint the U.S. Co-Issuer as its
authorized agent upon which process may be served in any such action or proceeding that may be instituted in
any such court and (4) agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail
addressed to the U.S. Co-Issuer, with written notice of said service to such Person at the address of the U.S.
Co-Issuer set forth in the Indenture shall be effective service of process for any such action or proceeding
brought in any such court.

**Currency indemnity**

The Dollar, with respect to the Dollar notes, and the euro, with respect to the Euro Notes, are the sole currencies
(as applicable, the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuers or any
Guarantor under or in connection with the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees, including damages. Any
amount with respect to the Notes, Indenture or Guarantees received or recovered in a currency other than the
Required Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers or any Guarantor or otherwise by any noteholder or
by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Issuers or any Guarantor will only
constitute a discharge to the Issuers or any Guarantor to the extent of the Required Currency amount that the
recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If that Required Currency amount is less than the Required Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient
or the Trustee under the Notes, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify such recipient and/or the Trustee
against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify the
recipient against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it
will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein, for, such recipient (with respect to itself), the holder of a
Note (with respect to itself) or the Trustee (with respect to itself) to certify in a manner satisfactory to the Issuers
(indicating the sources of information used) the loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities
constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’ and each Guarantor’s other obligations, will
give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any such
recipient, such holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will
continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in

242


-----

respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee. For the purposes of determining the amount in a
currency other than the Required Currency, such amount shall be determined using the Exchange Rate then in
effect.

“Exchange Rate” means, on any day, the rate at which the currency other than the Required Currency may be
exchanged into the Required Currency at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date on the

on any Bloomberg Key Cross Currency Rate Page, the Exchange Rate shall be determined by the Dutch
Co-Issuer in good faith.

**Book entry, delivery, and form**

The Dollar Notes sold to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers (each, a “QIB”) in
reliance on Rule 144A will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without coupons
attached (the “Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes”). The Dollar Notes sold to persons outside the United States in
reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act (“Regulation S”) will be represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Temporary Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”).
The Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes and the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited with a custodian
for, and registered in the name of, Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The Euro Notes sold to QIBs in reliance on
Rule 144A will be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached
(the “Euro Rule 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Rule 144A
Global Notes”). The Euro Notes sold to persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S will be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Euro
Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes, the “Regulation S Global
Notes”). The Rule 144A Global Notes and the Regulation S Global Notes are collectively referred to as the
“Global Notes.” The Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited
with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts
of Euroclear and Clearstream. Through and including the 40th day after the later of the commencement of this
offering and the closing of this offering (such period through and including such 40th day, the “Restricted
Period”), beneficial interests in the Temporary Regulation S Global Notes may not be transferred to beneficial
interests in another Global Note, unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A Global
Note in accordance with the certification requirements described below.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A BookEntry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, or persons that hold interests through such participants. DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream
will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in
their respective names on the books of their respective depositaries. Except under the limited circumstances
described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive certificated form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the
book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream and their participants. The laws of some jurisdictions,
including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical
delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to
own, transfer, or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of BookEntry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the
Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear, and/or Clearstream, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the
Indenture.

None of the Issuers or the trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating
to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Payments on global notes**

The Issuers will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal,
premium, if any, and interest) to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes and the

286


-----

Dollar Regulation S Global Notes) and to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream
(in the case of Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and Euro Regulation S Global Notes), which will distribute such
payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuers will make payments of all
such amounts without deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, levies,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law and as described
under “Description of Notes—Additional amounts.” If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made,
then, to the extent described under “Description of Notes—Additional amounts” above, we will pay additional
amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner
of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner
would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent
such withholding or deduction. The Issuers expect that standing customer instructions and customary practices
will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuers, the trustee, the paying agents, registrars and transfer agents
(collectively, the “Agents”) will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for
all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the trustee, the Agents, or any of their respective agents has
or will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or for
maintaining, supervising, or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream, or any participant or indirect
participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, or DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream,
or any participant or indirect participant.

**Currency of payment for the global notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Rule
144A Global Notes and the Dollar Regulation S Global Notes, will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes
through DTC in dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in
respect of, the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes and the Euro Regulation S Global Notes, will be paid to holders of
interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euros.

**Action by owners of book-entry interests**

DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken by
a holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of
one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given
such direction. DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under an indenture, each of DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes
under such indenture for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) and
to distribute Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with DTC,
Euroclear, and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell Notes to persons in jurisdictions that
require physical delivery of securities or to pledge such Notes, such holder must transfer its interests in the
Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the Indenture.

287


-----

The Global Notes for Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will have a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer
_restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and_
certification requirements discussed under “Transfer restrictions.”

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the
Securities Act or any other exemption (if available under the Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
“qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of
Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer restrictions” and
in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the
Regulation S Global Notes and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Notes.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form
of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the
first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in
such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

**Notices**

So long as the Global Notes are held on behalf of a clearing system, notices required to be given to noteholders
may be given by their being delivered to that clearing system and will be deemed to have been given to the
noteholders on the date of delivery to such clearing system.

**Information concerning DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream**

**_DTC_**

DTC is:

   - a limited purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;

   - a “banking organization” under the New York Banking Law;

   - a member of the Federal Reserve System;

   - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

   - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC participants
include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other
organizations such as the initial purchasers. Others, such as banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies, and clearing
corporations, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant also have access to
the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.

288


-----

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain
banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not
participate in the DTC system or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest may be limited by the lack of a
definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions
attributable to the Dollar Rule 144A Global Note and the Dollar Regulation S Global Note only through DTC
participants.

**_Euroclear and Clearstream_**

Our understanding with respect to the organization and operations of Euroclear and Clearstream is as follows.
Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending, and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies,
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as
banks, brokers, dealers, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a
Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross market transfers
between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will
be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by the
common depositary; provided, however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to
Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and
within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction
meets its settlement requirements, delivery instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final
settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes in DTC, and making or receiving
payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear
participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an
interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to
the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be
a business day for Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of sales of interests in a Global Note by or through
a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the settlement date
of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day
for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear, and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, Euroclear, or Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued at any time. None of the Issuers, the trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees and obligations as co-issuer**

Set out below is a summary of certain limitations on the enforceability of the guarantees in each of the
jurisdictions in which guarantees are being provided. Set out below is also a summary of the restrictions and
limitations in respect of the Swedish Co-Issuer. It is a summary only, and proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency
or a similar event could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organization of a future
guarantor of the Notes offered hereby. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could
trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply, and could adversely affect your ability to enforce
your rights and to collect payment in full under the Notes offered hereby and the guarantees.

Also set out below is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law, in force as of the date hereof, in
Brazil, Canada, Denmark, the European Union, Germany, Sweden, and the United States. In the event that any
one or more of the guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which
jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings.

**Brazil**

**_Guarantees_**

There are several options under Brazilian law to guarantee contractual obligations. The two main classifications
are personal guarantees (garantias fidejussórias) and in rem guarantees (garantias reais). Both personal and in
_rem guarantees are primarily governed by the Law 10,406 of January 10, 2002 (the “Brazilian Civil Code”), with_
additional pieces of legislation applicable depending on the type of guarantee and/or asset being encumbered.

Pursuant to the laws of Brazil, the invalidity of the underlying obligation results in the invalidity of the ancillary
obligation. As a result, if a judgment declaring or considering the underlying obligations null, void or
unenforceable is obtained in a court outside Brazil, any enforcement awards against the guarantors may not be
confirmed by the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior Tribunal de Justic¸a).

**_Personal guarantees_**

There are two main types of personal guarantees: surety (fiança) or surety specific to certain negotiable
instruments (aval). By means of either type of personal guarantee, a guarantor undertakes to satisfy an obligation
of a third party debtor in the event such debtor fails to satisfy such obligation. A surety must be granted in
writing and is narrowly construed by courts. A guarantor will not be liable for the underlying obligation until the
principal debtor’s obligation has become due and payable.

Sureties may cover future debts as well as existing ones. Furthermore, sureties cover all obligations that are
ancillary to the principal obligation, including judicial expenses, unless the parties otherwise provide for a
specific limitation. A surety in non-negotiable instruments (fiança) may be granted for an amount that is less than
the principal obligation, whereas sureties in negotiable instruments (aval) may not.

Brazilian law grants certain benefits to guarantors, some of which may be waived contractually. In case the
surety is enforced, for example, a guarantor has the right to require, at any time before challenging the merits of
the case, that attachment measures are first carried out with respect to the debtor’s property, provided that the
guarantor must indicate to the court sufficient assets of the debtor to serve as payment. Creditors usually require
that guarantors waive such benefit so that the fulfillment of the obligation can be sought against both the
guarantor and the debtor simultaneously.

A guarantor may release itself at any time from a surety in non-negotiable instruments (fiança) executed without
any limitation in time; it will then remain bound by all the effects of the surety during sixty days following the
service of the notice to the creditor. Creditors commonly require guarantors to waive such benefit.

290


-----

**_In rem guarantees_**

In Brazil, an obligation may also be secured through in rem guarantees over an asset through pledge, mortgage,
or assignment/transfer on a fiduciary basis. Only a person who may freely dispose of an asset is entitled to
pledge, mortgage, or assign/transfer such asset on a fiduciary basis.

According to the Brazilian Civil Code, agreements governing the terms and conditions of the guarantee must
provide at least the following information: the amount of the debt (or an estimate or maximum amount of such
debt), the maturity date, the interest rate (if any), and the description of the asset granted as security with its
specifications. Specific types of in rem guarantees may require further details. Furthermore, the agreements must
be registered with a legally mandated body, such as the real estate registry, the registry of titles and deeds and
documents (“RTD”) and/or boards of trade, depending on the nature of the guarantee and of the underlying asset,
so as to be duly created, perfected, enjoy priority and/or be otherwise fully enforceable against third parties,
depending on the type of guarantee.

Assets owned by more than one owner, in general, may not be granted as security in whole without the consent
of all co-owners. Nevertheless, each owner might individually create a security interest over his or her share of
the asset.

Unless expressly provided for otherwise, a person who grants an in rem guarantee for a third party obligation is
not obligated to replace or reinforce the underlying asset if it deteriorates or devalues, unless the guarantor gives
cause to such situation.

Brazilian law generally does not allow creditors to take the assets granted as security as payment of defaulted
obligations. In an enforcement scenario, the asset must normally be sold to a third party in order to fulfill the
debtor’s obligations under the agreement. However, (1) a debtor may grant, at its discretion, the asset to the
creditor in satisfaction of the obligation after it has become due and payable and if the creditor so agrees or
(2) the asset may be delivered to the creditor in payment of the debt in certain conditions, subject to court
approval. Finally, if upon enforcement of the pledge or the fiduciary assignment/transfer, or foreclosure of the
mortgage, the proceeds are insufficient to settle the underlying debt and the related expenses, the debtor shall
continue to be personally liable for any and all outstanding obligations except in certain specific circumstances in
connection with the foreclosure of real estate fiduciary transfer as provided by Law.

**_Pledge_**

Under Brazilian law, a pledge is a security interest that consists of the transfer of possession of a movable asset
(such as machinery, receivables, shares or quotas, and intellectual property rights) of a debtor or a third party
guarantor to a creditor as security to certain obligations.

As a rule, a pledge is perfected and becomes valid upon the transfer of the possession of the assets to the creditor
and registration of the agreement with the relevant body. However, the Brazilian Civil Code allows certain
pledged assets to be kept under possession of the guarantor or of the debtor itself, as a depositary thereof.
Transfer of possession may therefore take place only in a legal sense (tradição ficta). Certain types of pledges
may demand additional perfection requirements, such as regulatory approvals.

Pledges provide creditors priority over the pledged assets for the satisfaction of the secured obligations in
preference to other general unsecured creditors (other than in a bankruptcy scenario, as further detailed in item
(3) (Bankruptcy liquidation) below).

With respect to pledges over shares of a corporation (sociedade anônima) or quotas of a limited liability
company (sociedade limitada), such pledge will only be fully perfected and enforceable against third parties if, in
addition to the registration of the pledge agreement with the relevant RTD, the parties also (1) perform the proper
annotations of the existence of the pledge in the company’s share registration book, in the case of a corporation

291


-----

(pledge over shares); or (2) register with the board of trade an amendment to the articles of association of the
company reflecting the pledge in favor of the creditor, in the case of a limited liability company (pledge of
quotas).

In addition to guaranteeing the secured obligations, a shares/quotas pledge agreement may also provide for
restrictions in the voting rights of shareholders and quotaholders (more than often by giving the creditor veto
rights with respect to certain matters). Matters subject to veto are usually those which may result in the
depreciation in the value of shares or quotas or which may adversely affect or impair the rights of the creditors.

**_Fiduciary assignment or transfer_**

The fiduciary assignment or transfer is a collateralized transaction under Brazilian law consisting of a provisional
transfer to a creditor of a debtor’s ownership rights over specified assets to a creditor; by means of such transfer,
the assets functionally serve as collateral for the debtor’s obligation. Both movable and immovable (i.e., real
estate), tangible and intangible (i.e., rights), assets can be transferred or assigned on a fiduciary basis.

The main difference between pledges and assignments/transfers on fiduciary basis is the transfer of property
rights rather than mere possession (which may be transferred only in a legal sense, as discussed above).
Therefore, upon satisfaction by the debtor of its obligation, the ownership rights in the collateral automatically
revert to the debtor. If the debtor defaults, the creditor becomes the owner of the collateral and is entitled to sell
the collateral to third parties, provided that certain requirements for the enforcement of the creditor’s rights are
met. Such proceeding can occur by means of an extrajudicial/out-of-court procedure (in case of real estate assets,
with the relevant real estate registry), by means of two public auctions).

While ownership rights over the asset are transferred to the creditor, the debtor retains rights of possession over
the asset in order to duly manage it. However, such rights can be subjected to certain limitations in light of the
security granted over the asset – for instance, the creditor may be granted rights to inspect the asset.

The main advantage of fiduciary assignments/transfers over pledges is the special treatment usually afforded to
creditors upon the commencements of the insolvency proceedings provided by Law No. 11,101/05, the Brazilian
Bankruptcy Law (see “—Bankruptcy Liquidation (falnêcia)”).

Fiduciary assignments/transfers are governed by the Brazilian Civil Code, Brazilian Federal Law No. 9,514/97,
Brazilian Federal Law No. 4,728/65, Decree-Law No. 911/69 and Brazilian Federal Law No. 13,043/14,
depending on the nature of the underlying asset, and must be registered with the RTD or with the relevant real
estate registry (in case the security interest is created over a real estate property) in order to be constituted,
perfected and effective against third parties.

There may be restrictions to the fiduciary transfer of rural real properties to foreign creditors, due to laws
restricting the ownership of rural and border zone properties by foreigners, respectively Laws 5,709/71 and
6,634/79. More recently, there are some legal disputes on the possibility of creating a fiduciary assignment or
transfer over fungible assets in favor of foreign creditors, and, although some courts have already ruled on the
validity of such fiduciary assignment or transfer, such dispute is still not settled. The same concern does not
apply in case the fiduciary ownership is created over an infungible asset. For the rural real properties located in
the border zone, the only exception is the constitution of in rem guarantees (i.e. mortgage and fiduciary sale) in
favor of financial institutions with foreign capital that was authorized by Law No. 13,097/2015.

According to specific provisions contained in Law No. 9,514/97, which regulates the fiduciary transfer of real
estate, in case of foreclosure, two auctions may take place. If the real estate property is not sold at the first
auction by at least the greater value between the one declared in the private instrument/public deed or the value
attributed by the Municipality, the real estate registry office will carry out a second public auction, in which
occasion the real estate property may be sold by the highest bid, provided that such bid covers at least the value

292


-----

of the debt and other applicable charges. Up to the date of the second auction, the debtor has the right to
repurchase the property, also by paying the full debt amount and respective accessories, plus the transfer tax and
other expenses previously paid by the creditor. If the property is not sold in the second auction, the foreclosure
procedure is finished, and the ownership of the property remains with the creditor, with no amounts being due to
the debtor, even if the value of the property is higher/lower than the value of the debt (mutual release). In other
words, in case the property is not sold in the second auction and the real estate property is assigned to the
creditor, a mutual release would take place and the creditor would not be entitled to seek any outstanding debt (if
applicable) under the underlying obligation.

**_Mortgage_**

Mortgages are security interests created over a real estate property owned by the debtor or a third party
guarantor. Mortgages encompass everything that is incorporated into the soil as well as everything that the owner
intentionally maintains on the real estate property for its industrial exploitation (including machines and
equipment), comfort, and/or improvement, provided that such assets fall within the definition of immovable
assets under Brazilian law. Any provision that prohibits the owner from selling the real estate mortgaged is null
and void. However, the parties to the mortgage may agree that the secured obligations will accelerate in case the
owner wishes to sell the property prior to the termination of the mortgage.

Mortgages must be registered with the relevant real estate registry or registries in order to be constituted,
perfected, and effective against third parties. In addition, the same asset may be given in mortgage to more than
one creditor, in different priority degrees. Hence, if the asset must be sold in order to pay a defaulted obligation,
the creditors holding mortgage in lower degrees will successively receive the proceeds of the sale, after the debt
of the creditor of the higher degree is fully paid.

The foreclosure of mortgages shall be performed by means of judicial procedure, which is more expensive and
time consuming when compared to the extrajudicial proceeding applicable for fiduciary assignment or transfer.

With regard to the creation of mortgages over rural real properties in favor of foreign creditors, whether a
financial institution or not, since the mortgage is solely a lien created over a third party’s property (debtor’s
property), there is no issue arising from the restrictions contained in Law 5,709/71. Regarding the rural real
properties located in the border zone, the restrictions imposed by Law 6,634/79 would apply, except for the
constitution of mortgage in favor of financial institutions with foreign capital as authorized by Law No.
13,097/2015.

Except for the specific case involving financial institution in the border zone that was already ruled by
Law No. 13,097/2015, the actual issue would appear at the time of the foreclosure of the mortgage, when, in
addition to the sale of the property in a public auction, creditor would also be entitled to (i) request a private sale;
(ii) sale through a public auction; (iii) acquire/adjudicate the property (adjudicac¸a˜o), or (iv) create a usufruct of
the property.

In view of the current restrictions established by Law 5,709/71, the foreign creditor’s option to acquire/adjudicate
the property will be automatically affected, and therefore, unless the restrictions of such law are fulfilled (i.e.
obtaining a prior authorization), creditor will only have the possibility to enforce the other foreclosure
alternatives of debtor’s assets in order to obtain its credit.

**Insolvency Proceedings**

The insolvency proceedings provided by Law 11,101/05, the Brazilian Bankruptcy Law, are (i) judicial
reorganization (recuperac¸a˜o judicial); (ii) out-of-court reorganization (recuperac¸a˜o extrajudicial); and (iii)
bankruptcy liquidation (faleˆncia).

293


-----

**_Judicial reorganization (recuperac¸a˜o judicial)_**

The judicial reorganization proceeding is requested by the debtor (and only by the debtor) and binds all claims
existing up to the filing date, even those not yet due, except for (i) tax and social security-related credits; (ii)
credits related to forward foreign exchange agreements; and (iii) credits arising from financial leases, fiduciary
ownership or transfer of property, owner or committed seller of real estate which the respective agreements
include an irrevocability and or irreversibility clause, and purchase agreements with title retention (“Exempted
Claims”). The Notes do not constitute Exempted Claims for the purposes of the Brazilian Bankruptcy Law.

The debtor must present a list of creditors, with its judicial reorganization request, which shall be classified
according to legal standards, consisting of (i) labor creditors; (ii) secured creditors; (iii) unsecured creditors; and
(iv) small sized enterprises (a class provided in Law no. 147, dated August 7, 2014). Creditors that were not
listed by the debtor are entitled to file a proof of claim seeking the inclusion of the claim in the list. Creditors that
disagree with the amount or classification are entitled to claim for correction of the list. The claims arising from
the Notes would be listed as unsecured credits in a judicial reorganization proceeding of the Brazilian Subsidiary
Guarantors.

Once the debtor files for judicial reorganization, and provided that all legal requirements are met, the court will
authorize the filing of the proceeding and such order will also trigger a 180-day protection period, during which
the majority of the lawsuits filed against the debtor (including all foreclosure proceedings) will be suspended
(“Processing Order”). Although creditors holding Exempted Claims are not subject to the proceeding, such
creditors cannot sell or remove from the debtor equity assets which are deemed essential for the debtor’s
activities during the stay period.

Within 60 days of the Processing Order, the debtor must present its reorganization plan, which should set forth in
detail: (i) the reorganization measures to be undertaken; (ii) a showing of the economic viability of the plan; and
(iii) an economic financial report and an assessment of the assets and liabilities of the company undergoing
restructuring, prepared by a qualified professional or by a specialized company. If any creditor opposes the
reorganization plan, the court will convene a creditors’ general meeting to discuss and vote the plan. For the
approval of the reorganization plan at a creditors’ general meeting, two requirements must be met: (i) in the
classes of secured and unsecured creditors, the plan must be approved by more than 50% of the creditors
attending the meeting both by amount of claims and number of creditors (on a headcount basis); and (ii) in the
classes of labor claims and small enterprises, by more than 50% of creditors attending the meeting (on a
headcount basis), regardless of the amount of their claims.

The Brazilian Bankruptcy Law also grants the debtor the possibility to cram down the reorganization plan, in the
event that the requirements described above are not met. The cram down is only possible if (i) at least 50% of the
creditors attending the meeting voted favorably for the approval of the reorganization plan; (ii) the plan is
approved by two classes of creditors or, in the event that there are only two classes of creditors, at least one class
approved the plan; and (iii) one-third of the creditors attending the meeting in the rejecting class voted favorably
for the approval of the plan (such one third can be either based on the amount of claims and/or number of
creditors, depending on the class).

Although not expressly established by Brazilian law, holders of notes are generally allowed to directly participate
in the judicial reorganization proceeding of the Brazilian company and vote the reorganization plan pro rata to its
individual holdings at the general meeting of creditors.

The reorganization plan results in the replacement and renewal of all credits existing prior to the filing of the
reorganization, and is binding on the debtor and all creditors subject to it, although it should not affect guarantees
provided by third parties.

Once the reorganization plan has been approved, the debtor will remain under the judicial reorganization
proceeding for a period of two years, during which time failure on the part of the debtor to comply with any

294


-----

obligations set forth in the plan will result in the transformation of the judicial reorganization into a liquidation
proceeding. In similar fashion, failure to obtain approval of the reorganization plan from creditors or failure to
secure court-ordered ratification of the reorganization plan will also result in the commencement of liquidation
proceedings against such debtor.

Shareholders and directors also keep the control and management of the company during the judicial
reorganization proceedings, but may be removed if certain requirements are met. A creditor’s committee (if any)
and a court-appointed administrator (administrador judicial) will supervise the actions of the debtor and
management in order to assure that they comply with the legal requirements. The commencement of judicial
reorganization proceeding does not have the automatic effect of terminating the company’s executory contracts.

Please note that creditors secured by fiduciary liens are not subject to the judicial reorganization proceedings (or
the bankruptcy liquidation). Due to the nature of the security interest created by a fiduciary security structure (the
ownership of the asset is conditionally transferred to the creditor), they are deemed as Exempted Creditors.
Therefore, such creditors may enforce their rights against the debtor outside of the judicial reorganization
proceeding.

Due to the special treatment given to such fiduciary creditors, the prevalence of this kind of security has
substantially increased in Brazil. It is worth mentioning that, notwithstanding the above description of the special
treatment given to such security, there are court decisions stating that if the asset offered as a fiduciary security is
considered essential for a debtor’s commercial activities, then the fiduciary lien may not be enforced or be
completely disregarded in order to protect the entity’s businesses.

Brazilian Bankruptcy Law may be less favorable to creditors than those of certain other jurisdictions. In addition,
any judgment obtained in Brazilian courts in respect of any payment obligations under the guarantee would
normally be expressed in real currency equivalent of the foreign currency amount of such sum at the exchange
rate in effect: (i) on the date of actual payment; (ii) on the date on which such judgment is rendered; or (iii) on
the date on which collection or enforcement proceedings are started against a Brazilian company. In the event of
bankruptcy liquidation (falência), the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations, including the guarantee under the notes,
which are denominated in foreign currency, will be converted into reais at the prevailing exchange rate on the
date of declaration of the bankruptcy liquidation by the court.

**_Out-of-court reorganization_**

Out-of-court reorganization is a private pre-package arrangement between debtors and its creditors through
which they agree to new conditions for the payment of existing debts. The reorganization plan for repayment
must be drawn and proposed by the debtor. Once such reorganization plan is approved by creditors representing,
at least 3/5 of each impaired class of creditors or group of creditors similarly situated, the debtor may seek the
plan’s confirmation in court. Upon court’s confirmation, the reorganization plan will bind all creditors from all
impaired classes or group of creditors contemplated in such plan (even dissenting creditors who did not agree
with the plan), except for the Exempted Claims and certain labor related claims.

Any creditor may file objections to the plan. If the plan is not confirmed by the court, the debtor can submit a
new reorganization plan or can file for judicial reorganization proceedings.

In general, the debtor’s request for confirmation of the plan will not entail the suspension of the rights, actions or
enforcement proceedings, including creditors holding the Exempted Claims. However, courts have in some cases
granted a stay period in out-of-court reorganization proceedings. Moreover, the ratification of a plan does not
prevent the Exempted Creditors from requesting the debtor’s bankruptcy liquidation.

As a rule, during the extrajudicial reorganization proceedings, shareholders, and directors keep the control and
management of the company.

295


-----

**_Bankruptcy Liquidation (faleˆncia)_**

The bankruptcy liquidation proceeding seeks to clear all debts and credits of an insolvent company, with payment
to its creditors from proceeds obtained from the sale of the assets of the estate in bankruptcy.

Under Law 11,101/05, the Brazilian Bankruptcy Law, a company will be liquidated whenever (i) it fails, without
legal reason, to pay a debt which is represented by a protested enforceable instrument and which exceeds the
equivalent of 40 minimum wages, the total of which equates to approximately BRL 38,160 as of July 2018; or
(ii) enforcement proceedings are pending and it does not pay, deposit, or appoint sufficient assets within the
requisite legal term.

A debtor may also be considered bankrupt if it (i) sells its assets in advance or resorts to ruinous or fraudulent
means to make payments; (ii) performs (or tries to perform by unequivocal actions) a sham transaction or the
disposal of part or all of its assets to a third party, with the objective of delaying payments or of defrauding
creditors; (iii) transfers its place of business without the consent of all creditors and does not maintain sufficient
assets to settle its liabilities; (iv) performs a fraudulent (sham) transaction to transfer its main place of business to
evade the law or to prejudice a creditor; (v) gives or increases security for an existing debt and does not maintain
sufficient free and clear assets to settle its liabilities; (vi) becomes absent without leaving any competent
representative with enough resources to pay the creditors; (vii) abandons its place of business or tries to hide
from its domicile, head office or main place of business; and/or (viii) fails to perform an obligation due under a
court reorganization plan in a corporate judicial reorganization procedure (akin to Chapter 11 in the U.S.).

Once the bankruptcy liquidation request (pedido de falência) is accepted and the bankruptcy liquidation decree is
issued, judicial measures filed by creditors must be stayed, and any claims will be submitted to the Bankruptcy
Court, who has jurisdiction over the debtor assets (juízo universal), subject to certain exceptions, including
litigation over tax claims and to those in which the estate figures as plaintiff or co-plaintiff.

When a company is bankrupt, the unmatured debts become due and payable (including those of shareholders
with unlimited and joint liability), with a pro-rata deduction of interest up to the date of the bankruptcy
liquidation decree. All foreign currency denominated debt is converted into Brazilian Real (at the exchange rate
prevailing on the date of the bankruptcy liquidation decree).

The debtor is automatically prevented from conducting any business activity and from managing or disposing its
assets; the court appoints a judicial administrator to manage the estate; and shareholders cannot sell their
shareholdings or otherwise withdraw from the company. The executory contracts which the debtor has entered
into with third parties do not terminate automatically and the judicial administrator may perform these
agreements if certain requirements are met.

In addition, and among other duties, the judicial administrator will proceed to the collection and assessment of all
assets of the debtor, including any assets in the possession of a third party by reason of a pledge or deposit, for
instance. Then, the assets sale will begin, so that the amounts due by the debtor can be repaid to creditors
pursuant to a mandatory priority (described below) schedule with the proceeds obtained from such sales.

Brazilian Bankruptcy Law establishes the following order of payment: (i) claims relating to employee contracts,
limited to 150 times the minimum wage per employee, and labor accidents (with no cap limitation); (ii) claims of
creditors that hold in rem security (i.e. mortgages or pledges, up to the value of the assets given as collateral );
(iii) federal, state and municipal tax claims, excluding fines; (iv) special privileged claims; (v) general privileged
claims (including creditors from micro or small companies, in accordance with the complementary law no. 147
abovementioned); (vi) all other unsecured claims (including residual balance of labor-related claims exceeding
the statutory cap); (vii) contractual and public fines and penalties, including tax penalties; and (viii) claims by the
debtor’s shareholders and managers which do not have an employment relationship with the debtor. The Notes
will constitute a pre-filing unsecured liability of the Brazilian Subsidiary Guarantors.

296


-----

Nevertheless, prior to the payment of the creditors mentioned in the paragraph above, the following post-petition
or extrajudicial claims and creditors shall be liquidated: (i) fees payable to the judicial administrator and his
assistants and labor-related claims or occupational accident claims referring to services rendered after the decree
of bankruptcy; (ii) credit provided by the creditors to the bankrupt estate; (iii) administrative expenses with
schedules, management, asset realization and distribution of the proceeds, as well as court costs of the
bankruptcy proceedings; (iv) court costs with respect to actions and enforcement proceedings in which the
bankrupt estate is defeated; (v) obligations resulting from legal acts performed during the judicial reorganization,
such as debtor-in-possession loans, or after the decree of bankruptcy, and taxes which become due after the
decree of bankruptcy.

_Claw Back Actions—Fraudulent Transactions_

Under the allegation of fraud against creditors, a creditor, the judicial administrator and/or the public prosecutor
may challenge transactions entered into by a Brazilian Guarantor in the context of an insolvency proceeding or
even during normal course of business if there is evidence that inter alia: (i) the insolvency of the Brazilian
Guarantor was known at the time the transaction was carried out, or should be known; and/or (ii) if the
transaction was carried out with the intention of defrauding creditors, there was a fraudulent collusion between
the Brazilian Guarantor and the third party involved in the transaction; and the transaction caused effective
damage to the insolvent estate of the Brazilian Guarantor. In such a situation, the transaction may be declared
null and void, according to the provisions of Brazilian law.

In addition to the above, the court can set aside transactions which take place up to 90 days before (as
determined by the court) the bankruptcy request, the judicial reorganization request or the first protest against the
debtor due to failure of payment. These transactions include: (i) payments of debts that were not due and
payable; (ii) payments made in a way which differed from those set out in the relevant contractual agreement;
and (iii) the granting of new security to existing unsecured debts. The court can also set aside, regardless of
whether the debtor intended to defraud creditors or whether the third party to the transaction knew of the debtor’s
financial difficulties: (i) transactions for no consideration carried out within two years of the declaration of
bankruptcy; (ii) the waiver of inheritance rights in general by the debtor within two years of the declaration of
bankruptcy; and (iii) the sale of the debtor’s business if the value of the debtor’s assets is insufficient to pay its
debts and the consent of unpaid creditors has not been obtained, unless they have been (judicially or extra
judicially, through a public notary) notified of the sale and have not opposed it within 30 days. Certain
transactions may also be rendered null and void if it is proven that, even though no particular debt existed at the
moment when the transaction was rendered null and void, a transaction by a party virtually insolvent going
forward took place and the need to have funds to cover future obligations should have been foreseen by the
parties to the transaction that was rendered null and void.

_Procedural Fraud_

Under the allegation of procedural fraud (fraude a` execuc¸a˜o), a creditor may challenge transactions entered into
by a Brazilian Guarantor if there is evidence that, by the time the transaction took place: (i) there was a pending
enforcement proceeding filed against the Brazilian Guarantor; and (ii) the transaction led the Brazilian Guarantor
to insolvency, i.e., the payment of the credit held by the creditor was put at risk due to the Brazilian Guarantor’s
lack of sufficient assets to cover the payment claimed in the claim. In such case, it is not necessary for the
creditor to produce evidentiary support of the fraud (neither guilt, nor evidence of intention), which may be
presumed under special circumstances. It is also not necessary for the creditor to file a separate claim against the
debtor as well: the transaction will simply be disregarded by the judge in charge of the case, according to the
provisions of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.

_Participation of holders in insolvency legal procedures_

Courts in Brazil have taken different approaches regarding the representation of creditors holders of a bond or
note issuance in insolvency procedures. Some courts, especially in the state of São Paulo, have admitted the

297


-----

representation of the holders of notes or bonds by an agent while other have admitted the direct and individual
participation of the beneficial owner of the notes, sometimes even considering the relevant note as independent
creditor.

_Cross-border reorganization_

Brazilian law has no specific provisions on cross-border reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings. Generally
foreign court decisions must be submitted to ratification before a Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior
_Tribunal de Justiça) in order to become enforceable in Brazil (homologação de sentença estrangeira), as_
explained above. Court decisions taken on foreign judicial reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings may be
subject to the same proceeding, observing the proper formal and material requirements. On the other hand, it
must be highlighted that as Brazilian courts have exclusive jurisdiction over the reorganization and bankruptcy of
Brazilian companies, only partial decisions (for instance, recognition of creditors) may be taken by foreign courts
and enforced in Brazil, once duly confirmed by the Superior Court of Justice. More recently, Brazilian Courts
have established jurisdiction to hear the insolvency proceedings of foreign subsidiaries or affiliates of Brazilian
companies and debtors where it established that Brazil was the center of main interest and/or operations of such
foreign entities.

**Canada**

Certain guarantors are corporations formed under the federal laws of Canada. In the event of an insolvency of a
Canadian guarantor, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Canada and Canadian insolvency law would
govern those proceedings either as a main proceeding or, in the event of a foreign non-main proceeding, in
respect of any aspects of such proceedings to be undertaken in Canada under the supervision of a Canadian court.
The guarantees of such Canadian guarantor may be subject to review under applicable Canadian federal
bankruptcy, insolvency and winding-up laws and applicable provincial and territorial fraudulent conveyance,
assignment and preference laws or comparable provisions of applicable laws if a bankruptcy, insolvency,
arrangement or reorganization proceeding or lawsuit is commenced by or in respect of a Canadian guarantor.

Under applicable Canadian laws, on application by an interested party, a court could void a Canadian guarantor’s
obligations under the relevant guarantee or subordinate the guarantee to such Canadian guarantor’s other debt or
seek other monetary or specific remedy, if, among other things, it is established that the Canadian guarantor, at
the time it incurred the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee:

   - issued the guarantee with the intention to delay, hinder, defeat, or defraud creditors, noting however that
if the guarantee occurs in the context of a related party transaction within twelve months of the
insolvency, the intention may be inferred or may not be a necessary element to prove;

   - received conspicuously less than fair market value for issuing the guarantee at the time it issued the
guarantee;

   - was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the guarantee;

   - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature or for
other fraudulent reasons; or

   - had the effect of giving the beneficiaries of the guarantees a preference.

As reviewable transactions in the context of insolvency are subject to provincial laws in some cases, the extent of
review and available remedies may vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether
an actionable transaction has occurred.

Under the BIA, a Canadian guarantor would be considered insolvent if:

   - it is unable to meet its obligations as they generally become due;

298


-----

   - it has ceased paying its current obligations in the ordinary course of business as they generally become
due; or

   - the aggregate of its assets is not, at fair valuation, sufficient, or if disposed at a fairly conducted sale
under legal process, would not be sufficient to enable payment of all its obligations, due and accruing
due.

Other tests apply under other Canadian insolvency laws.

We cannot be sure, depending on the circumstances, as to the standard that a court would use to determine
whether or not a Canadian guarantor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that the court
uses, that the issuance of the guarantee would not be voided or the guarantee would not be subordinated to the
Canadian guarantor’s other debt. If such a case were to occur, the guarantee could also be subject to the claim
that the guarantee was incurred for our benefit and only indirectly for the benefit of the relevant Canadian
guarantor and that, as a result, the obligations of the relevant Canadian guarantor were incurred for less than fair
consideration or under value.

During the pendency of proceedings under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws (the “Bankruptcy /
Insolvency Proceedings”), creditors are stayed from claiming against a debtor company for any pre-filing debt or
enforcing any of the debtor’s obligations without prior approval from the court supervising the relevant
Bankruptcy / Insolvency Proceedings.

Under Canadian federal bankruptcy and insolvency laws, a court may grant an order authorizing interim
financing that may rank in priority to the debt of any other creditor of the debtor, whether or not such debt is
secured. In such a circumstance, the court must consider a number of factors, including whether any creditor
affected by the proposed order may be materially prejudiced. The court may provide protections in favour of the
affected creditor in the face of material prejudice. The Court may also grant an order affirming certain pre-filing
charges for obligations arising in connection with the Bankruptcy/Insolvency Proceeding, for example in the case
of unpaid amount owing to critical suppliers.

However, this power is discretionary, and we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, holders of the Notes
offered hereby would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value.

If a Canadian court were to find that the incurrence of a guarantee was a fraud, lacked consideration, was a
transfer at undervalue, preference, or other similar voidable transaction, the Canadian court could upon
application by an interested party, among other things, have the guarantee set aside or voided, or order that it not
be set up against the trustee and creditors in bankruptcy. In the event of a finding that a transfer at undervalue or
similar voidable transaction has occurred, holders of the Notes offered hereby may not receive any repayment on
the Notes offered hereby. Further, the voidance of the Notes offered hereby could result in an event of default
with respect to our other debt that could result in acceleration of such debt.

Each purchaser of the Notes hereby agrees that it is the purchaser’s express wish that all documents evidencing
or relating in any way to the sale of the Notes be drafted in the English language only. Chaque acheteur des
_Billets reconnaît qu’il est de sa volonté expresse que tous les documents faisant foi de la vente des Billets, ou s’y_
_rapportant de quelque manière que ce soit, soient rédigés uniquement en anglais._

**Denmark**

It is a requirement under Danish law that a guarantor or security provider such as any Danish Guarantor obtains
an adequate corporate benefit from the issuance of a guarantee or granting of security. This is due to a
requirement under Danish law that the management of a company must always ensure a proper management of
the company’s assets. Furthermore, the management of the company is obliged to act in accordance with the
company’s individual interests, including consideration of the company’s financial position, the benefits that the

299


-----

company will obtain through, and the risks related to, the granting of guarantees and security, assessment of the
debtor, securing that the arrangement is on market terms, etc. If such benefit is not obtained, the directors of a
Danish guarantor or security provider may be subject to civil liability and the guarantee and/or security may be
deemed invalid. It is not clear under Danish case law under which circumstances corporate benefit accrues to a
subsidiary when such subsidiary guarantees and secures debt of a direct or indirect parent company or other
group company.

Certain of the Guarantors are companies incorporated under Danish law. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings
with respect to these companies would likely proceed under and be governed by Danish insolvency laws (as
indicated above under the headline “European Union” of this section Council Regulation (EC) no. 1346/2000 on
insolvency proceedings does not apply in Denmark). These laws may adversely affect the enforcement of
Noteholders’ rights under the Notes and may not be as favorable to their interests as a creditor as the laws of
other jurisdictions.

_Bankruptcy_

In a Danish bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated, and the proceeds are distributed to the creditors based
on a priority of claims. Such liquidation may not yield the same value to the creditors as a reorganization and sale
of a going concern.

As a general rule, the insolvent company or any creditor of such company may file a petition for bankruptcy. A
bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is unable to fulfil its obligations as they
fall due and that the insolvency is not temporary based on an assessment of the debtor’s liquidity status. A
bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the event of the debtor’s
insolvency by means of good and valid security. The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on the fundamental
principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some extent modified
by the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. Some claims (certain preferential and privileged claims)
rank before ordinary claims and other claims (certain subordinated claims) rank below ordinary claims. The
status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except for subordinated loans, which by contract
are subordinated). Preferential claims primarily include costs and expenses involved in the administration of the
bankruptcy estate and debts approved by an administrator during a suspension period. Privileged claims are
mainly salary claims (excluding salary claims from the top management), including salary income taxes relating
thereto. Most tax claims are ordinary claims. Interest accrued on ordinary claims will rank as ordinary claims up
to the date of the bankruptcy adjudication, after which date the accrued interest will rank as a subordinated claim.
Danish bankruptcy law contains several provisions enabling the trustee in bankruptcy to initiate proceedings to
have certain transactions prior to the bankruptcy avoided. Most avoidance provisions contain time limits, which
are generally three or six months, but such periods are extended (i) up to two years if (inter alia) a transaction has
been made to the benefit of a person or entity closely related to the debtor and/or (ii) for an indefinite period if
the debtor was or became insolvent or unable to pay its debts due to the transaction and if the transaction is
deemed improper.

Payments made by unusual means and payments made before they are due or in amounts that have had a
distinctly impairing effect on the debtor’s ability to pay its debts, are typically subject to avoidance.

In addition, all types of charges, mortgages and other types of security that were not granted to the creditor at the
time the debt was incurred or that were not perfected without undue delay after the time the debt was incurred
will generally be avoided.

Under Danish bankruptcy law the issuance of guarantees may also be subject to avoidance if, among other things
(i) the issuance was made at a time when the issuer was insolvent, (ii) the issuance is without due consideration
and/or (iii) between closely related parties.

A creditor who wishes to raise a claim for avoidance may do so through the trustees in bankruptcy, who must
litigate the matter under the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts (not the bankruptcy court). As a general rule, such

300

legal proceedings must be initiated within twelve months after the declaration of the bankruptcy adjudication. In
the event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish kroner using the Danish
National Bank’s (Nationalbanken) official exchange rate for the relevant currency against Danish kroner as at the
date of declaration of bankruptcy by the Danish Bankruptcy Court.

_Restructuring_

Danish insolvency law also includes a scheme for reconstruction of insolvent companies. During the
reconstruction procedure, creditors are restricted in their ability to enforce their claims, but valid and binding
security may be enforced under certain conditions.

A company as well as a creditor may file an application for restructuring with the Bankruptcy Court. For the
Bankruptcy Court to initiate a restructuring process it is required that the company is unable to fulfil its
obligations as they fall due (and that the insolvency is not temporary) as further described in the section above
entitled “—Bankruptcy” above. The main purpose of the restructuring is for an otherwise healthy company to
overcome the insolvency. A restructuring must involve a compulsory composition/moratorium and/or a business
transfer or a combination of both. When a restructuring process is initiated, the Bankruptcy Court will appoint a
restructuring administrator and an accountant. The administrator shall, inter alia, prepare a restructuring plan
and, together with the court-appointed accountant, a final restructuring proposal. A meeting shall be held at the
Bankruptcy Court where the creditors must vote on the final restructuring proposal. If the restructuring process
does not result in a compulsory composition/moratorium and/or a business transfer or a combination of both that
is adopted by the creditors, the Bankruptcy Court will commence bankruptcy proceedings. The restructuring will,
however, be lifted if the debtor becomes solvent during the proceedings. As a result of the restructuring, the
debtor will be protected against claims for payment by his creditors during the restructuring. The debtor is not
allowed to make any transactions of material importance without the approval of the administrator. Payments to
creditors may only be made in accordance with the ranking of creditors in bankruptcy, or if the payment is
necessary in order to avoid losses.

_Financial assistance_

The Danish Companies Act (Consolidated Act No. 1089 of 14 September 2015 on public and private limited
liability companies, as amended and supplemented from time to time (Lovbekendtgørelse om aktie-og
_anpartsselskaber (selskabsloven)) contains restrictions on financial assistance by Danish limited companies._

Generally, Danish companies and their Danish and foreign subsidiaries may not grant loans to, or issue
guarantees or provide security for loans to, their shareholders or the shareholders of their parent companies.
However, Danish companies may grant loans to, or issue guarantees or provide security for loans to, parent
companies covered by Danish Executive Order No. 275/2010 (on loans etc. to foreign parent companies), which
includes any entity in the corporate form of (a) a public limited company (aktieselskab), (b) a limited partnership
company (partnerselskab), (c) a private limited company (anpartsselskab), or (d) a company with an equivalent
corporate form, having its registered office in inter alia any E.U. or EEA country.

In addition, Danish companies are generally prohibited from granting loans, guarantees, or security in connection
with the financing or refinancing of the acquisition of their own shares or shares in their parent companies and
any such loan, guarantee, or security will be invalid and unenforceable. To the extent that any such acquisition
debt cannot be separated from other debt, such other debt may be deemed acquisition debt and any loans,
guarantees, or security granted by Danish companies for such other debt may then also be invalid or
unenforceable. According to the Danish Business Authority, the prohibition on financial assistance also extends
to non-Danish subsidiaries of Danish companies. If loans, guarantees, or security are granted in violation of the
prohibitions above, such loans, guarantees, or security will be invalid and unenforceable and must be repaid with
statutory interests. The directors may be subject to liability for losses suffered in this regard.

301


-----

_Contractual Limitations of Guarantees granted by Guarantors incorporated in Denmark_

To mitigate the above mentioned financial assistance issues, the guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors
will be limited if and to the extent required to comply with Danish statutory provisions on unlawful financial
assistance and non-permitted shareholder loans including, without limitation, Sections 206-212 of the Danish
Companies Act. Accordingly, as all proceeds of the Notes are used towards financing of the (direct or indirect)
acquisition of the Danish Guarantors and/or their parent companies, the Notes will not have the benefit of
guarantees from the Danish Guarantors.

In addition, the guarantees granted by the Danish Guarantors will further be limited to a maximum amount
equivalent to the higher of the equity (egenkapital) of a Danish Guarantor (calculated in accordance with the
approved accounting principles) at the time of the granting of the guarantee, or at the time payment is requested
pursuant to the guarantee.

_Enforceability_

The Notes and the Trustee will not be registered with the Danish Financial Supervisory (Finanstilsynet) pursuant
to Chapter 4 of the Danish Capital Markets Act (Consolidated Act No. 12 of 8 January 2018 as amended and
supplemented from time to time (Lov om kapitalmarkeder)), and therefore the guarantees granted by the Danish
Guarantors may be deemed to be expressed to be granted in favor of unspecified creditors. The enforceability of
guarantees expressed to be granted in favor of unspecified creditors, and for which no notice of each new creditor
is given to the guarantor, has not been tested by the Danish courts.

**European Union**

The Dutch Co-Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of member states (each a
Member State” and collectively, the “Member States”) of the E.U.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2015 on
insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (the “E.U. Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the E.U.,
other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a `company’s “center of main interests” (as that
term is used in Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to commence main
insolvency proceedings relating to such company. The determination of where a debtor has its “center of main
interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even
conflicting views.

Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has
its center of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office, in the absence of proof to the
contrary (which presumption shall not apply if the registered office has been moved to another Member State
within the three month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings), Article 3(1),
second sentence, of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interests “shall be the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third
parties.” The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the center of main interests
of a debtor, including, in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the
majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are
established. Recital 30 of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation states that the presumption should be rebutted where
the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and
where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by
third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision of the company and of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. A debtor’s center of main interests is not a
static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts
have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency
petition.

302


-----

If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered
office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation would be
commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the
types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency
proceedings commenced in one Member State under the E.U. Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the
other E.U. Member States (other than Denmark), although territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings may be
commenced in another Member State.

If the center of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the
E.U. Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to
commence territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an
“establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) in the
territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean “any place of operations where a
debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open main insolvency
proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of
territorial (secondary) insolvency proceedings in another E.U. Member State will also be possible if the debtor
had such an establishment in such E.U. Member State in the three month period prior to the request for
commencement of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such
other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main
interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another
Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (1) insolvency proceedings cannot be
commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that Member
State’s law or (2) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim
arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member
State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of
the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening
of insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency
proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex fori concursus, i.e., the
local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing
main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary
proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State
which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there)
may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to
remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency
proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to
the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the
debtor has assets. The E.U. Insolvency Regulation provides for a corporation and communication mechanism in
the event that insolvency proceedings concerning two or more members of a group of companies are opened.
Insolvency practitioners appointed in proceedings concerning a member of the group shall cooperate with any
insolvency practitioner appointed in proceedings concerning another member of the group to extent that such
cooperation is appropriate. Similarly, the court which has opened proceedings shall also cooperate with any other
court before which a request is made to open proceedings concerning another member of the group to extent that
cooperation is appropriate to facilitate the effective administration of the proceedings, is not incompatible with
the rules applicable to them and does not entail any conflict of interest. In this respect, the courts may, where
appropriate, appoint a third party, provided that this is not incompatible with the rules applicable to them.

**Germany**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain guarantors are organized under the laws of Germany and have their registered office in Germany (the
“German Guarantors”). In the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in
Germany if a German Guarantor was held to have its center of main interests within the territory of Germany at
the time the application for the opening of insolvency proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsantrag) is filed. German
insolvency law would then most likely govern those proceedings.

The insolvency laws of Germany and, in particular, the provisions of the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung) may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other
jurisdictions, including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition
interest and the duration of the insolvency proceedings, and hence may limit your ability to recover payments due
on the Notes to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under other insolvency laws. See “Risk factors—Risks
_related to the Notes and our indebtedness—Insolvency laws of jurisdictions outside the United States may not be_
_as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments_
_due under the Notes.”_

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Germany.

Under German insolvency law, there is no group insolvency concept, which generally means that, despite the
economic ties between various entities within one group of companies, there will be one separate insolvency
proceeding for each of the entities if and to the extent there exists an insolvency reason on the part of the relevant
entity. Each of these insolvency proceedings will be legally independent from all other insolvency proceedings
(if any) within the group. In particular, there is no consolidation of assets and liabilities of a group of companies
in the event of insolvency and no pooling of claims among the respective entities of a group. Recently, the
German legislator adopted an act to facilitate the handling of group insolvencies (Gesetz zur Erleichterung der
_Bewältigung von Konzerninsolvenzen) which entered into force on April 21, 2018. However, this act mainly_
provides for coordination of and cooperation between insolvency proceedings of group companies. The act does
not provide for a consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of the insolvent group companies, or a
consolidation of the assets and liabilities of a group of companies or pooling of claims amongst the respective
entities of a group, but rather stipulates four key amendments of the German Insolvency Code in order to
facilitate an efficient administration of group insolvencies: (i) a single court may be competent for each group
entity insolvency proceeding; (ii) the appointment of a single person as insolvency administrator for all group
companies is facilitated; (iii) certain coordination obligations are imposed on insolvency courts, insolvency
administrators and creditors’ committees; and (iv) certain parties may apply for “coordination proceedings”
(Koordinationsverfahren) and the appointment of a “coordination insolvency administrator”
(Koordinationsverwalter) with the ability to propose a “coordination plan” (Koordinationsplan).

Under German insolvency law, insolvency proceedings are not initiated by the competent insolvency court ex
_officio, but require that the debtor or a creditor files a petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings._
Insolvency proceedings can be initiated either by the debtor or by a creditor in the event of over-indebtedness
(Überschuldung) of the debtor or in the event that the debtor is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due
(Zahlungsunfähigkeit). According to the relevant provision of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung),
a debtor is over-indebted when its liabilities exceed the value of its assets (based on their liquidation values),
unless a continuation of the debtor’s business as a going concern is predominantly likely (überwiegend
_wahrscheinlich) at least for the current and subsequent fiscal year. As a guideline, the debtor is deemed illiquid if_
it is unable to pay 10% or more of its due and payable liabilities during the subsequent three weeks, unless it is
virtually certain (positive Fortführungsprognose) that the company can close the liquidity gap shortly thereafter
(demnächst) and due to the individual circumstances at hand it can be deemed acceptable to the creditor to
continue to wait for the payments owed by such debtor. If a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft—AG), a
European law stock corporation based in Germany (Societas Europaea—SE) or a limited liability company

304


-----

(Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—GmbH) or any company not having an individual as personally liable
shareholder (such as, e.g., a limited partnership with a GmbH as sole general partner (GmbH & Co. KG))
becomes illiquid and/or over indebted, the managing director(s) of such company and, under certain
circumstances, its shareholders, are obliged to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings without undue
delay, however, at the latest within three weeks after the mandatory insolvency reason, i.e., illiquidity and/or
over-indebtedness, occurred. Non-compliance with these obligations exposes management to both severe damage
claims as well as sanctions under criminal law. Once illiquidity or over-indebtedness occurred, any payments,
subject to certain exemptions, including any payments under the Notes, are voidable. In addition, imminent
illiquidity (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) is a valid insolvency reason under German law which exists if the
company currently is able to service its payments obligations, but will presumably not be able to continue to do
so at some point in time within a certain prognosis period. However, only the debtor, but not the creditors, is
entitled (but not obliged) to file for the opening of insolvency proceedings if the debtor is likely to not be able to
pay its debts as and when they fall due.

The insolvency proceedings are administered by the competent insolvency court which monitors the due
performance of the proceedings. Upon receipt of the insolvency petition, the insolvency court may take
preliminary measures (vorläufige Maßnahmen) to secure the property of the debtor during the preliminary
proceedings (Insolvenzeröffnungsverfahren). The insolvency court may prohibit or suspend any measures taken
to enforce individual claims against the debtor’s assets during these preliminary proceedings. In addition, the
court will generally also appoint a preliminary insolvency administrator (vorläufiger Insolvenzverwalter), unless
the debtor has petitioned for debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung, meaning an insolvency process in
which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering the debtor’s business affairs under
the supervision of a provisional custodian (vorläufiger Sachwalter), with this petition not being obviously
futile)—an insolvency process in which the debtor’s management generally remains in charge of administering
the debtor’s business affairs under the supervision of a custodian (Sachwalter)—provided that no circumstances
are known which lead to the expectation that debtor-in-possession status will place the creditors at a
disadvantage. Depending on the size of the debtor’s business operations, the insolvency court must or may
appoint a preliminary creditors’ committee (vorläufiger Gläubigerausschuss) to form a view on a petition for
debtor-in-possession status, or on the profile of the (preliminary) insolvency administrator to be appointed or to
suggest a particular individual to be appointed by the court. In case the members of the preliminary creditors’
committee unanimously agree on an individual, such suggestion is binding on the court (unless the suggested
individual is not eligible, i.e., not competent and/or not impartial). To ensure that the preliminary creditors’
committee reflects the interests of all creditor constituencies, it shall include a representative of the secured
creditors, one for the large creditors and one for the small creditors as well as one for the employees. The duties
of the preliminary insolvency administrator are, in particular, to safeguard and to preserve the debtor’s assets
(which may include the continuation of the business carried out by the debtor), to verify the existence of an
insolvency reason and to assess whether the debtor’s net assets will be sufficient to cover the costs of the
insolvency proceedings. The court orders the opening (Eröffnungsbeschluss) of formal insolvency proceedings
_(eröffnetes Insolvenzverfahren) if certain requirements are met, in particular if there are sufficient assets_
_(Insolvenzmasse) to cover at least the costs of the insolvency proceedings. If the assets of the debtor are not_
expected to be sufficient, the insolvency court will only open formal insolvency proceedings if third parties, for
instance creditors, advance the costs themselves. In the absence of such advancement, the petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings will be dismissed for insufficiency of assets (Abweisung mangels Masse).

Upon the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, an insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) (usually,
but not necessarily, the same person who acted as preliminary insolvency administrator) is appointed by the
insolvency court, unless a debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) is ordered. In the absence of a
debtor-in-possession status, the right to administer the debtor’s business affairs and to dispose of the assets of the
debtor passes to the insolvency administrator with the insolvency creditors (Insolvenzgläubiger) only being
entitled to change the individual appointed as insolvency administrator at the occasion of the first creditors’
assembly (erste Gläubigerversammlung) with such change requiring that (i) a simple majority of votes cast (by
head count and amount of insolvency claims) has voted in favor of the proposed individual becoming the

305


-----

insolvency administrator and (ii) the proposed individual being eligible as officeholder, i.e. sufficiently qualified,
business-experienced, and impartial. The insolvency administrator may raise new financial indebtedness and
incur other liabilities to continue the debtor’s business. These new liabilities incurred by the insolvency
administrator qualify as preferential claims against the estate (Masseverbindlichkeiten) which are preferred to
any insolvency claim of an unsecured creditor (with the residual claim of a secured insolvency creditor remaining
after realization of the available collateral (if any) also qualifying as unsecured insolvency claim).

From the perspective of the holders of the Notes, among others, some important consequences of such opening of
formal insolvency proceedings against any German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries that are
subject to the German insolvency regime would be the following:

   - the right to administer and dispose of the assets of such Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries
would generally pass to the insolvency administrator (Insolvenzverwalter) as sole representative of the
insolvency estate, unless the court orders debtor-in-possession proceedings (Eigenverwaltung);

   - if the court does not order debtor-in-possession status (Eigenverwaltung) with respect to such German
Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries, disposals effected by the management of such German
Guarantor or such subsidiary, after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings, are null and void by
operation of law;

   - if, during the final month preceding the date of filing for insolvency proceedings or thereafter, a creditor
in the insolvency proceedings has acquired through execution (e.g., attachment) a security interest in
part of such German Guarantor’s or any of their relevant subsidiaries’ property that would normally
form part of the insolvency estate, such security becomes null and void by operation of law upon the
opening of formal insolvency proceedings;

   - claims against such German Guarantor or any of their relevant subsidiaries may only be pursued in
accordance with the rules set forth in the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung); and

   - any person that has a right for separation (Aussonderungsrecht) (i.e., the relevant asset of this person
does not constitute part of the insolvency estate, such as creditors with retention of title) does not
participate in the insolvency proceedings; the claim for separation must be enforced in the course of
ordinary court proceedings against the insolvency administrator

All creditors, whether secured or unsecured (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the insolvency
estate (Aussonderungsrecht)), wishing to assert claims against the insolvent debtor need to participate in the
insolvency proceedings. German insolvency proceedings are collective proceedings and creditors may generally
no longer pursue their individual claims in the insolvency proceedings separately, but can instead only enforce
them in compliance with the restrictions of the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung). With some
exceptions, secured creditors may not be entitled to enforce their security interest outside the insolvency
proceedings. In the insolvency proceedings, however, secured creditors have certain preferential rights
(Absonderungsrechte). Depending on the legal nature of the security interest, entitlement to enforce such security
is either vested with the secured creditor or the insolvency administrator. In this context, it should be noted that
the insolvency administrator generally has the sole right to realize any moveable assets in his/the debtor’s
possession which are subject to preferential rights (e.g., liens over movable assets (Mobiliarsicherungsrechte) or
security transfer of title (Sicherungsübereignung)) as well as to collect any claims that are subject to security
assignment agreements (Sicherungsabtretungen). In case the enforcement right is vested with the insolvency
administrator, the enforcement proceeds, less certain contributory charges for (i) assessing the value of the
secured assets (Feststellungskosten) and (ii) realizing the secured assets (Verwertungskosten) which, in the
aggregate, usually add up to 9% of the gross enforcement proceeds plus VAT (if any), are disbursed to the
creditor holding a security interest in the relevant collateral up to an amount equal to its secured claims. With the
remaining unencumbered assets of the debtor, the insolvency administrator has to satisfy the creditors of the
insolvency estate (Massegläubiger) first (including the costs of the insolvency proceedings as well as any
preferred liabilities incurred by the insolvency estate after the opening of formal insolvency proceedings).

306


-----

Thereafter, all other claims (insolvency claims—Insolvenzforderungen), in particular claims of unsecured
insolvency creditors and residual claims of secured insolvency creditors reaming after realization of the available
collateral (if any), will be satisfied on a pro rata basis if and to the extent there is value remaining in the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse) after the security interests and the preferential claims against the estate have
been settled and paid in full. Hence, the proceeds resulting from the disposal of the insolvency estate of the
debtor may not be sufficient to satisfy the unsecured claims of the holders of the Notes. In addition, it may take
several years until an insolvency dividend (if any) is distributed to unsecured creditors.

The right of a creditor to preferred satisfaction (Absonderungsrecht) may not necessarily prevent the insolvency
administrator from using a movable asset that is subject to this right. The insolvency administrator must,
however, compensate the creditor for any loss of value resulting from such use.

Other than secured and unsecured creditors, German insolvency law provides for certain creditors to be
subordinated by law (including, but not limited to, claims made by shareholders (unless privileged) of the
relevant debtor for the repayment of shareholder loans or similar claims), while claims of a person who becomes
a creditor of the insolvency estate only after the opening of insolvency proceedings (Massegläubiger) generally
rank senior to the claims of regular, unsecured creditors. Claims of subordinated creditors in the insolvency
proceedings (nachrangige Insolvenzgläubiger) are satisfied only after the claims of other non-subordinated
creditors (including the unsecured insolvency claims) have been fully satisfied.

The insolvency estate shall serve to satisfy the liquidated claims held by the personal creditors against the debtor
on the date the insolvency proceedings were opened. The following claims of subordinated creditors shall be
satisfied ranking below the other claims of insolvency creditors in the order given herein, and in proportion to
their amounts if ranking with equal status: (i) interest and penalty payments accrued on the claims of the
insolvency creditors from the opening of the insolvency proceedings; (ii) costs incurred by individual insolvency
creditors due to their participation in the proceedings; (iii) fines, regulatory fines, coercive fines and
administrative fines, as well as such incidental legal consequences of a criminal or administrative offense binding
the debtor to pay money; (iv) claims on the debtor’s gratuitous performance of a consideration; and (v) claims for
the restitution of shareholder loans (Gesellschafterdarlehen) or claims resulting from legal transactions
corresponding in economic terms to such a loan.

While in ordinary insolvency proceedings, the value of the German Guarantors’ or any of their relevant
subsidiaries’ assets will be realized by a piecemeal sale or, as the case may be, by a bulk sale of the entity’s
business as a going concern, a different approach aiming at the rehabilitation of such entities can be taken based
on an insolvency plan (Insolvenzplan). Such plan can be submitted by the debtor or the insolvency administrator
and requires, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, the consent of the German Guarantors and the
consent of each class of creditors in accordance with specific majority rules and the approval of the insolvency
court (while a group of dissenting creditors or the debtor can—under certain circumstances—be crammed down).
If the debtor is a corporate entity, also the shares or, as the case may be, the membership rights in the debtor can
be included in the insolvency plan, e.g., they can be transferred to third parties, including a transfer to creditors
based on a debt-to-equity swap. Moreover, if the debtor has filed a petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings based on an insolvency reason other than illiquidity (i.e., imminent illiquidity or over-indebtedness),
combined with a petition to initiate such process based on a debtor-in-possession status and can prove that a
restructuring of its business is not obviously futile (offensichtlich aussichtslos), the court may grant a period of
up to three months to submit an insolvency plan for the debtor business before it opens insolvency proceedings
(Schutzschirm). During this period, the creditors’ rights to enforce security may—upon application of the filing
debtor—be suspended. Under these circumstances, the insolvency court has to appoint a custodian (vorläufiger
_Sachwalter) to supervise the process. The debtor is entitled to suggest an individual to be appointed as custodian_
with such suggestion being binding on the insolvency court unless the suggested person is obviously not eligible
to become a custodian (i.e., is obviously not competent or impartial).

307

**_Hardening periods and fraudulent transfer_**

Under the German Insolvency Code, the insolvency administrator (or in case of debtor-in-possession
proceedings, the custodian) may challenge (anfechten) transactions, performances or other acts that are deemed
detrimental to insolvency creditors and which were effected prior to the commencement of formal insolvency
proceedings during applicable voidable periods. Generally, if transactions, performances or other acts are
successfully challenged by the insolvency administrator or custodian, any amounts or other benefits derived from
such challenged transaction, performance or act will have to be returned to the insolvency estate. The
administrator’s or custodian’s right to challenge transactions can, depending on the circumstances, extend to
transactions having occurred up to ten years prior to the filing for the commencement of insolvency proceedings.

With regard to these voidness rights, according to the recent amendments (Act for the improvement of legal
certainty concerning claw-back pursuant to the German Insolvency Code and the German Law of Voidness,
_Gesetz zur Verbesserung der Rechtssicherheit bei Anfechtungen nach der Insolvenzordnung und dem_
_Anfechtungsgesetz vom 29. März 2017) of the German Insolvency Code that came into force on April 5, 2017,_
among other things, the provisions on voidness for intentionally disadvantaging third party creditors
(Vorsatzanfechtung), for cash transactions (Bargeschäfte) and the interest rates on voidness claims have been
amended.

In the event of insolvency proceedings with respect to the German Guarantors or any of their relevant
subsidiaries based on and governed by the insolvency laws of Germany, the granting of guarantees, or the
payment of any amounts to the holders of the Notes could be subject to potential challenges (i.e., clawback
rights) by an insolvency administrator under the rules of voidness as set out in the German Insolvency Code
(Insolvenzordnung). In the event such a transaction is successfully challenged (angefochten), the holders of the
Notes may not be able to recover or retain any amounts under the Notes. If payments have already been made
under the Notes, any amounts received from a transaction that had been voided would have to be repaid to the
insolvency estate (Insolvenzmasse).

In particular, an act (Rechtshandlung) or a legal transaction (Rechtsgeschäft) (which term includes the granting of
a guarantee, the provision of security and the payment of debt) detrimental to the creditors of the debtor may be
challenged according to the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) in the following cases:

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security, or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) if such act was taken (i) during the last three months prior to the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the debtor was illiquid
(zahlungsunfähig) at the time such act was taken and the creditor knew of such illiquidity (or of
circumstances that clearly suggest that the debtor was illiquid) at such time, or (ii) after the filing of the
petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings, if the creditor knew of the debtor’s illiquidity or the
filing of such petition (or of circumstances that clearly suggest such illiquidity or filing);

   - any act granting an insolvency creditor, or enabling an insolvency creditor to obtain, security, or
satisfaction (Befriedigung) to which such creditor was not entitled, or which was granted or obtained in
a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was not entitled to such security or satisfaction, if
(i) such act was taken during the last month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or after such filing, (ii) such act was taken during the second or third month
prior to the filing of the petition and the debtor was illiquid at such time or (iii) such act was taken
during the second or third month prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency
proceedings and the creditor knew at the time such act was taken that such act was detrimental to the
other insolvency creditors (or had knowledge of circumstances that clearly suggest such detrimental
effect);

   - a legal transaction by the debtor that is directly detrimental to the insolvency creditors or by which the
debtor loses a right or the ability to enforce a right or by which a proprietary claim against a debtor is
obtained or becomes enforceable, if it was entered into (i) during the three months prior to the filing of

308


-----

the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the debtor was illiquid at the time of such
transaction and the counterparty to such transaction knew of the illiquidity at such time or (ii) after the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings and the counterparty to such transaction
knew either of the debtor’s illiquidity or of such filing at the time of the transaction;

   - any act performed by the debtor during the ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of
insolvency proceedings or at any time after the filing, if the debtor acted with the intention of
prejudicing its insolvency creditors (vorsätzliche Gläubigerbenachteiligung) and the beneficiary of the
act knew of such intention at the time of such act; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled
a creditor to obtain, security, or satisfaction for a debt, the above ten-year period is reduced to four
years; “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” in terms of such provision is presumed if the
beneficiary knew that the debtor was imminently illiquid (drohende Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the
relevant act disadvantaged the other creditors; in case the relevant act granted a creditor, or enabled a
creditor to obtain, security, or satisfaction in a form or at a time to which or at which such creditor was
entitled, the “knowledge by the beneficiary of the act” is presumed if the beneficiary knew that the
debtor was actually illiquid (eingetretene Zahlungsunfähigkeit) and that the relevant act disadvantaged
the other creditors; the fact that the creditor agreed on a payment plan with the debtor or agreed to
deferred payments establishes a presumption that he had no knowledge of the debtor being illiquid at
this time;

   - any non-gratuitous contract concluded between the debtor and an affiliated party that directly operates
to the detriment of the creditors unless such contract was concluded earlier than two years prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or the other party had no knowledge of
the debtor’s intention to disadvantage its creditors as of the time the contract was concluded; in relation
to corporate entities, the term “affiliated party” includes, subject to certain limitations, members of the
management or supervisory board, general partners and shareholders owning more than 25% of the
debtor’s share capital, persons, or companies holding comparable positions that give them access to
information about the economic situation of the debtor, and other persons who are spouses, relatives, or
members of the household of any of the foregoing persons;

   - any act by the debtor without (adequate) consideration, if it was effected in the four years prior to the
filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings;

   - any act that provides security or satisfaction (Befriedigung) for a claim of a shareholder for repayment
of a shareholder loan or a similar claim if (i) in the case of the provision of security, the act took place
during the last ten years prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of insolvency proceedings or
after the filing of such petition or (ii) in the case of satisfaction, the act took place during the last year
prior to the filing of the petition for the opening of the insolvency proceedings or after the filing of such
petition; or

   - any act whereby the debtor grants satisfaction for a loan claim or an economically equivalent claim to a
third-party if (i) the satisfaction was effected in the last year prior to the filing of a petition for the
opening of insolvency proceedings or thereafter, and (ii) a shareholder of the debtor had granted security
or was liable as a guarantor or surety (Garant oder Bürge).

In this context, “knowledge” is generally deemed to exist if the other party is aware of the facts from which the
conclusion must be drawn that the debtor was unable to pay its debts generally as they fell due, that a petition for
the opening of insolvency proceedings had been filed, or that the act was detrimental to, or intended to prejudice,
the insolvency creditors, as the case may be. A person is deemed to have knowledge of the debtor’s intention to
prejudice the insolvency creditors if he or she knew of the debtor’s imminent illiquidity or illiquidity, as the case
may be and that the transaction prejudiced the debtor’s creditors. With respect to an “affiliated party”, there is a
general statutory presumption that such party had “knowledge”.

309


-----

The granting of security concurrently with the incurrence of debt may be qualified as a “cash transaction” and
may as such be privileged under certain circumstances under the German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung)
(Bargeschäftsprivileg) by not being subject to voidness rights.

Apart from the examples of an insolvency administrator or custodian voiding transactions according to the
German Insolvency Code (Insolvenzordnung) described above, a creditor who has obtained an enforcement order
(Vollstreckungstitel) could possibly also void any security right or payment performed under the relevant security
right according to the German Law of Voidness (Anfechtungsgesetz) outside formal insolvency proceedings. The
prerequisites vary to a certain extent from the rules described above and the voidance periods are calculated from
the date a creditor exercises its rights of voidance in the courts.

The German restructuring laws may be subject to further amendments in near future due to the current E.U.
Commission’s proposal as of November 22, 2016 for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council
on preventive restructuring frameworks, second chance and measures to increase the efficiency of restructuring,
insolvency and discharge procedures, and amending Directive 2012/30/EU which may, inter alia, stipulate that
claims of the relevant creditors may be modified by majority vote and against the voting of a single creditor even
outside formal insolvency proceedings.

**_Limitations on validity and enforceability of the guarantees_**

The granting of guarantees by the German Guarantors will be subject to certain German capital maintenance
rules of the German Act regarding Companies with Limited Liability (Gesetz betreffend die Gesellschaften mit
_beschränkter Haftung) (the “GmbHG”) if that German Guarantor is incorporated in Germany in the legal form of_
a German limited liability company (Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung—a “GmbH”) or a German limited
partnership with a German limited liability company as general partner (a “GmbH & Co. KG”). As a general rule,
sections 30 and 31 of the GmbHG (“Sections 30 and 31”) prohibit a GmbH from disbursing its assets to its
shareholders to the extent that the amount of the GmbH’s net assets (i.e., assets minus liabilities and liability
reserves)—or, in the case of a GmbH & Co. KG, its general partner’s net assets—is or would fall below the
amount of its stated share capital (Stammkapital). Guarantees granted by a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG in order
to guarantee liabilities of a direct or indirect parent or sister company are considered disbursements under
Sections 30 and 31.

Therefore, in order to enable German subsidiaries to grant guarantees to secure liabilities of a direct or indirect
parent or sister company without the risk of violating Sections 30 and 31 and to limit any potential personal
liability of management, it is standard market practice for credit agreements, indentures, guarantees and security
documents to contain so-called “limitation language” in relation to subsidiaries incorporated in Germany in the
legal form of a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG. Pursuant to such “limitation language”, the beneficiaries of the
guarantees contractually agree to enforce the guarantees against the German subsidiary only if and to the extent
that such enforcement does not result in the subsidiary’s—or, in case of a GmbH & Co. KG, in the general
partner’s—net assets falling below, or increasing an existing shortfall of, its stated share capital.

Accordingly, as a matter of German corporate law, the Indenture, or relevant supplemental indenture, to the
extent provided by a guarantor incorporated in Germany in a relevant corporate form as described above,
contains such contractual limitation language and such guarantees are limited in the manner described. This
could lead to a situation in which the respective guarantee granted by such guarantor cannot be enforced at all.

German capital maintenance rules are subject to evolving case law. We cannot assure you that future court
rulings may not further limit the access of shareholders to assets of German Guarantors constituted in the form of
a GmbH or a GmbH & Co. KG, which can negatively affect the ability of the Issuers to make payment on the
Notes or of the German Guarantors to make payments on the subsidiary guarantees.

In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the case law of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof)
regarding so-called—“destructive interference” (existenzvernichtender Eingriff) (i.e., a situation where a

310


-----

shareholder deprives a GmbH or GmbH & Co. KG of the liquidity necessary for it to meet its own payment
obligations) may be applied by courts with respect to the enforcement of a subsidiary guarantee granted by the
German Guarantors. In such case, the amount of proceeds to be realized in an enforcement process may be
reduced, even to zero. According to a decision of the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof), a
security agreement may be void due to tortious inducement of breach of contract if a creditor knows about the
distressed financial situation of the debtor and anticipates that the debtor will only be able to grant collateral by
disregarding the vital interests of its other business partners. It cannot be ruled out that German courts may apply
this case law with respect to the granting of subsidiary guarantees by the German Guarantors. Furthermore, the
beneficiary of a transaction effecting a repayment of the stated share capital of the grantor of the subsidiary
guarantee could moreover become personally liable under exceptional circumstances. The German Federal
Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled that this could be the case if, for example, the creditor were to act with
the intention of detrimentally influencing the position of the other creditors of the debtor in violation of the legal
principle of bonos mores (Sittenwidrigkeit). Such intention could be present if the beneficiary of the transaction
was aware of any circumstances indicating that the grantor of the guarantee is close to collapse
(Zusammenbruch), or had reason to enquire further with respect thereto.

**The Netherlands**

**_Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Dutch Co-Issuer and certain of the Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law (the “Dutch Guarantors”).
Accordingly, where debtors have their “center of main interests” or an “establishment” in the Netherlands they
may be subject to Dutch insolvency proceedings governed by Dutch insolvency laws, subject to certain
exceptions provided for in the E.U. Insolvency Regulation. See “—European Union.” The Dutch insolvency laws
may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions. The following
is a brief description of certain aspects of the Dutch insolvency laws.

Any insolvency proceedings applicable to the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors may be governed by
Dutch insolvency laws. There are two insolvency regimes under Dutch law. The first, a suspension of payments
(surseance van betaling), is intended to facilitate the reorganization of a debtor’s debts and enable the debtor to
continue as a going concern. The second, bankruptcy (faillissement), is primarily designed to liquidate the assets
of a debtor and distribute the proceeds thereof to its creditors. In practice a suspension of payments often results
in the bankruptcy of the debtor. Both insolvency regimes are set forth in the Dutch Bankruptcy Act
(Faillissementswet).

Only the management board of the debtor can make an application for a suspension of payments, and only if it
foresees that it will be unable to continue to pay its payable debts. Once the application has been filed, a court
will immediately (dadelijk) grant a provisional suspension of payments and appoint one or more administrators
(bewindvoerders). A meeting of creditors is required to decide on the definitive suspension of payments. If a
draft composition (ontwerp akkoord) is filed simultaneously with the application for a moratorium of payments,
the court can order that the composition will be processed before a decision about a definitive moratorium. If the
composition is accepted and subsequently ratified by the court (gehomologeerd), the provisional moratorium
ends. The definitive moratorium will generally be granted, unless a qualified minority (i.e., more than
one-quarter of the amount of claims held by creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting or more than one-third
of the number of creditors of the amount of claims held by creditors) of the unsecured, non-preferential, creditors
declare against it or if there is a valid fear that the debtor will try to prejudice the creditors during a suspension of
payments or if there is no prospect that the debtor will be able to satisfy its creditors in the (near) future. That the
debtor must be able to satisfy its creditors does not mean that they must be paid in full. It suffices that creditors
can be satisfied to some extent (for example, by receiving a percentage of their claims within the framework of a
composition). Other than in the case of the ordering by a competent court of a statutory stay of execution of up to
two months (extendable by another period of up to two months) imposed by court order pursuant to Article 241a
of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act, a suspension of payments will only affect unsecured, non-preferential creditors.

311


-----

During such stay of execution, a secured creditor may not, without the court’s consent (i) claim the asset subject
to the security right if it is under the control of (in de macht van) the debtor subject to a suspension of payments
or (ii) seek recourse against the asset.

Under Dutch law, a debtor can be declared bankrupt when it has ceased to pay its debts. Bankruptcy can be
requested by a creditor of a claim when there is at least one other creditor. At least one of the claims (of the
creditor requesting bankruptcy or the other creditor) needs to be due and payable. The debtor can also request the
application of bankruptcy proceedings itself. Furthermore, the Public Prosecution Service (het Openbaar
_Ministerie) can request the application of bankruptcy proceedings for reasons of public interest (openbaar_
_belang). In Dutch bankruptcy proceedings, a debtor’s assets are generally liquidated, and the proceeds distributed_
to the debtor’s creditors according to the relative priority of those creditors’ claims and, to the extent certain
creditors’ claims have equal priority, in proportion to the amount of such claims. Certain parties, such as secured
creditors, will benefit from special rights. Secured creditors, such as pledgees and mortgagees, may enforce their
rights regardless of suspension of payments or bankruptcy and do not have to contribute to the liquidation costs;
however, enforcement of the security right might be subject to the following: (a) a statutory stay of execution of
up to two months extendable by another period of up to two months imposed by court order pursuant to Article
63a of the Dutch Bankruptcy Act (Faillissementswet), which has the same effect as set forth above for stays of
execution in suspensions of payment; (b) a receiver (curator) can force a secured party to foreclose its security
right within a reasonable time (as determined by the receiver pursuant to Article 58(1) of the Dutch Bankruptcy
Act), failing which the receiver will be entitled to sell the relevant rights or assets and distribute the proceeds to
the secured party after a deduction of liquidation costs; and (c) excess proceeds of enforcement must be returned
to the company’s receiver and may not be offset against an unsecured claim of the company’s secured creditor.
Consequently, Dutch bankruptcy laws could reduce your potential recovery in Dutch bankruptcy proceedings.

Unlike Chapter 11 proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law, where both secured and unsecured creditors are
generally barred from seeking to recover on their claims, suspension of payment and bankruptcy proceedings
against the Dutch Co-Issuer, Dutch bankruptcy law allows secured creditors (and in case of suspension of
payments also preferential creditors (including tax and social security authorities)) to satisfy their claims by
proceeding against the assets (that secure their claims) as if there were no bankruptcy or suspension of payments.
However, a statutory stay of execution of up to two months, extendable by another period of up to two months,
may be declared applicable. Furthermore, certain preferred creditors have a preference by virtue of law. Unlike
secured creditors, preferred creditors are not entitled to foreclose on assets of the bankrupt. They do have priority
in the distribution of the proceeds of the bankrupt’s assets.

Remaining amounts, if any, after satisfaction of the secured and the preferential creditors are distributed among
the unsecured non-preferential creditors, who will—in principle—be satisfied on a pro rata basis. Contractual
subordination will be given effect in Dutch insolvency proceedings. However, the actual effect depends largely
on the way such subordination is construed. In exceptional circumstances, a compulsory plan of composition may
limit the contractual subordination.

Restrictions on the enforcement of security rights may apply. For instance, higher ranking rights must be
respected. These may include secured creditors with a higher-ranking security right and tax and social security
authorities. A statutory stay of execution of security rights and other rights of up to two months, extendable by
another period of up to two months, may be imposed. Further, a receiver in bankruptcy can force a secured
creditor to enforce its security right within a reasonable period of time, failing which the receiver will be entitled
to sell the secured assets, if any, and the secured creditor will have a preferred claim in respect of the proceeds,
meaning that the secured creditor will have to share in the bankruptcy costs, which may be significant. Excess
proceeds of any enforcement must be returned to the bankrupt estate; they may not be set-off against an
unsecured claim of the secured creditor. Such set-off may be allowed prior to the bankruptcy, provided that there
are no creditors with a security right, although there it may be subject to clawback in the case of fraudulent
conveyance or bad faith in obtaining the claim used for set-off.

312


-----

Any pending executions of judgments against the debtor will be suspended by operation of law when suspension
of payments is granted and terminate by operation of law when bankruptcy is declared. In addition, all
attachments on the debtor’s assets will cease to have effect upon the suspension of payments having become
definitive, a composition having been ratified by the court or the declaration of bankruptcy (as the case may be)
subject to the ability of the court to set an earlier date for such termination. Litigation pending on the date of the
bankruptcy order is automatically stayed.

Both in a definitive suspension of payments and bankruptcy, a composition (akkoord) may be offered to
creditors. A composition will be binding for all unsecured and non-preferential creditors if it is: (i) approved by a
simple majority (gewone meerderheid) of the number of creditors represented at the creditors’ meeting,
representing at least 50% of the amount of the claims that are acknowledged and conditionally admitted, and
(ii) subsequently ratified (gehomologeerd) by the court. Since the unsecured and non-preferential creditors
(including subordinated creditors) can vote on the composition plan and enforcement of security rights remains
possible, Dutch insolvency law could preclude or inhibit the ability of the holders of the Notes to effect a
restructuring and could reduce the recovery of a holder of Notes in a Dutch suspension of payments proceeding
or bankruptcy. Interest accruing after the date on which a suspension of payments or bankruptcy is granted,
cannot be claimed in a composition.

The claim of a creditor, other than a claim to the extent that it is secured by Dutch law security, may be limited
depending on the date the claim becomes due and payable in accordance with its terms. Claims that fall due more
than one year after the date of the bankruptcy, will be valued for distribution purposes as of the date the
bankruptcy was declared. Claims that become payable within one year after the bankruptcy was declared will be
considered payable from the day the bankruptcy was declared.

All unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims will have to be verified in the insolvency proceedings in order to be
entitled to vote and, in a bankruptcy liquidation, to be entitled to distributions. “Verification” under Dutch law
means, in the case of a suspension of payments, that the treatment of a disputed claim for voting purposes is
determined and, in the case of a bankruptcy, the unsecured, pre-bankruptcy claims are submitted to a receiver for
verification, and the receiver then makes a determination as to the claim’s existence, ranking and value and
whether and to what extent it should be admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings (for voting). In the situation of
bankruptcy, creditors that wish to dispute the receiver’s verification of their claims will be referred to a claim
validation proceeding (renvooiprocedure) in order to establish the amount and rank of the disputed claim, while
in suspension of payments the court will decide how a disputed claim will be treated for voting purposes. These
procedures could cause holders of Notes to recover less than the principal amount of their Notes or less than they
could recover in a U.S. liquidation proceeding. The renvooi proceedings could also cause payments to the holders
of Notes to be delayed. Interest on the Notes accruing after the bankruptcy order date cannot be admitted unless
secured by a pledge or mortgage, in which case interest will be admitted pro memoria, such as in case of the
Notes. To the extent that an interest is not covered by the proceeds of the security, the creditor may not derive
any rights from the admission. No interest is payable in respect of unsecured claims as of the date of a
bankruptcy.

**_Fraudulent Conveyance_**

Dutch law contains specific provisions dealing with fraudulent conveyance both in and outside bankruptcy: the
actio pauliana provisions. Under Dutch law, any creditor of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor or its
receiver (curator) may nullify any transaction or legal act entered into by the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch
Guarantor in connection with the Notes, under certain circumstances, if (i) the transaction or legal act entered
into by the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted without a prior
existing legal obligation to do so (onverplicht); (ii) the creditor(s) concerned or, in the case of its or their
bankruptcy, any creditor was prejudiced as a consequence of such transactions or legal act (irrespective of
whether a creditor’s claim arose prior to or after such transactions); and (iii) at the time of the transaction or legal
act entered into by the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor in connection with the Notes was conducted

313


-----

(including the granting of the Guarantees), the Dutch Co-Issuer or relevant Dutch Guarantor and, unless the
transactions were conducted for no consideration (om niet), the counterparty knew or should have known that one
or more of the entities’ creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced (actio pauliana).

A receiver (curator) may nullify a transaction on behalf of and for the benefit of the joint insolvent debtor’s
creditors, and the burden of proof of the above-mentioned elements of fraudulent conveyance in principle rests
on the receiver. Knowledge of prejudice is, however, presumed by law for certain transactions performed within
a “suspect period” of one year prior to an adjudication of bankruptcy. This is applicable for certain transactions
only, the most important application being in cases where the obligations of the bankrupt materially exceed those
of the other party, the satisfaction of existing obligations of the bankrupt that are not yet due, and acts between
the bankrupt and its counterparty when the shares in both are held (indirectly) by the same shareholder or if the
bankrupt and its counterparty are part of the same group of companies. The foregoing requirements for invoking
fraudulent transfer provisions outside a bankruptcy apply mutatis mutandis when invoking fraudulent transfer
provisions during a bankruptcy. In addition, the receiver may challenge a transaction if it was conducted on the
basis of a prior existing legal obligation to do so (verplichte rechtshandeling), if (i) the transaction was conducted
at a time when the counterparty knew that a request for bankruptcy had been filed or (ii) if such transaction was
conducted as a result of deliberation between the debtor and the counterparty in order to give preference to the
counterparty over the debtor’s other creditors. Consequently, the validity of any such transactions conducted by a
Dutch legal entity may be challenged and it is possible that such a challenge would be successful.

The application of Dutch law in respect of a Dutch law security interest will not prevent effect being given to the
overriding provisions of the law of a jurisdiction with which the situation has a close connection (and for this
purpose “overriding provisions” are provisions the respect for which are regarded as crucial by a jurisdiction for
safeguarding its public interests to such an extent that they are applicable to any situation falling within their
scope, irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to an agreement and include any rules (whether mandatory or
not) that must be applied pursuant to the E.U. Insolvency Regulation) and will not prevent regard having to be
had to the law of the jurisdiction in which performance takes place in relation to the manner of performance and
the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance. In addition, enforcement of Dutch law security
interest (including allocation of the proceeds) is subject to Dutch law. Among other things, under Dutch law
shares may only be transferred upon enforcement in accordance with Dutch law and the articles of association of
the company in which shares are pledged at the time of enforcement. Rights of third parties acquiring a share or a
limited right on a share and acting in good faith (te goeder trouw) may also affect the binding effect and
enforceability of a Dutch law security interest.

In proceedings before a Dutch court, security interests are in principle enforced through a public auction of the
relevant assets in accordance with Dutch law.

**_Enforceability of Guarantees and security, general defences, and corporate benefit_**

In general, receipt of any payment under a Dutch law governed guarantee or security interest may be affected by
(i) the standards of reasonableness and fairness (maatstaven van redelijkheid en billijkheid), (ii) force majeure
(niet toerekenbare tekortkoming) and unforeseen circumstances (onvoorziene omstandigheden), and (iii) the
other general defenses available to debtors under Dutch law in respect of the validity, binding effect and
enforceability of such guarantee or security interest. Other general defenses include claims that a guarantee or
security interest should be voided because it was entered into through undue influence (misbruik van
_omstandigheden), fraud (bedrog), duress (bedreiging) or error (dwaling). Other impeding factors include rights_
of suspension (opschorting), dissolution of a contract (ontbinding) and set off (verrekening). The enforceability
of the obligations of the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantors may also be limited under the 1977 Sanction Act
(Sanctiewet 1977) or otherwise by international sanctions and in proceedings in a Dutch court for the
enforcement of a Dutch law security interest, the court may mitigate amounts due in respect of litigation,
enforcement and collection costs.

314


-----

Furthermore, if the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor enters into a transaction (such as the granting of a
guarantee or security interest), the validity and enforceability of the relevant transaction may be contested by the
Dutch company or its administrator (bewindvoerder) in a suspension of payments or its receiver (curator) in
bankruptcy, if (i) that transaction is not in the company’s corporate interest (vennootschappelijk belang) and
(ii) the other party to the transaction knew or should have known this without independent investigation. In
determining whether the granting of a guarantee or the giving of security is in the interest of the relevant Dutch
company, a Dutch court would not only consider the text of the objects clause in the articles of association of the
company but also all relevant circumstances, including whether the company derives certain commercial benefits
from the transaction in respect of which the guarantee or security interest was granted and any indirect benefit
derived by the relevant Dutch company as a consequence of the interdependence of it with the group of
companies to which it belongs and whether or not the subsistence of the relevant Dutch company is jeopardized
by conducting such transaction. The mere fact that a certain legal act (rechtshandeling) is explicitly mentioned in
the objects clause in the articles of association of the company may not be conclusive evidence to state that such
legal act is in the corporate interests.

As of October 1, 2012, the prohibition on financial assistance for a Dutch private limited liability company
(besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) was removed from Dutch law. In connection with such
removal the legislator noted that the granting of security with a view to the acquisition (or the refinancing
thereof) by any party of shares in the company’s share capital or the shares of its (direct or indirect) parent
company could, depending on the further circumstances, constitute an ultra vires act. At present, there is no
Dutch case law on this subject.

A guarantee granted by a Dutch company and a security interest provided by a Dutch company may be
suspended or avoided by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam (Ondernemingskamer
_van het Gerechtshof te Amsterdam) on the motion of the holder or holders of 10% or more of the shares in such_
company or shares or depositary receipts issued therefor with a nominal value of €225,000 or more or such lesser
amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. If the company has an issued share capital of at least
€22.5 million, such motion may be made by a holder or holders of 1% or more of the shares in such company or,
provided those are listed on a qualifying trading venue, shares, or depositary receipts issued therefor with a value
of €20 million or more or such lesser amount as provided in the company’s articles of association. A trade union
and other entities entitled thereto in the articles of association of the relevant Dutch company may also submit a
motion to the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam for this purpose. The guarantee or
security itself may further be upheld by the Enterprise Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam, yet actual
payment under it may be suspended or avoided.

**Sweden**

**Limitations on validity and enforceability of co-issuers obligations and liabilities and the guarantees**

**_Applicable insolvency law_**

The Swedish Co-Issuer and certain Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Sweden (each such guarantor,
a “Swedish Guarantor”) and as such, the main rule is that insolvency proceedings applicable to each such
Swedish Guarantor, including any and all of its assets (in Sweden and abroad), will, as a matter of Swedish law,
be governed by Swedish insolvency law. In addition, a Swedish Guarantor will in principle be subject to
insolvency proceedings covered by the E.U. Insolvency Regulation (which includes all collective insolvency
proceedings available under Swedish law in respect of bodies corporate), if it has its “center of main interest”
(“COMI”) in Sweden.

The COMI is presumed, in the case of a company or body corporate, to be the place of its registration as a legal
person. Accordingly, if the Swedish party is registered in Sweden, Swedish courts will be entitled to open main
insolvency proceedings against it and apply the laws of the relevant insolvency proceedings. If the COMI of a
debtor is in an E.U. Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the E.U. Insolvency Regulation,

315


-----

the Courts of another E.U. Member State (other than Denmark) may open “territorial insolvency proceedings” or,
after the commencement of main proceedings, “secondary insolvency proceedings”, in the event that such debtor
possesses an “establishment” in the territory of such other E.U. Member State.

Further to the above, the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention of 7 November 1933 (the “Nordic Bankruptcy
**Convention”) has been entered into by and applies between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.**
The Nordic Bankruptcy Convention is implemented in Sweden through the Swedish Act on Bankruptcy
Comprising Property In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, or Norway (Sw. lag (1934:67) med bestämmelser om
_konkurs som omfattar egendom i Danmark, Finland, Island eller Norge) and the Swedish Act on Effects of_
Bankruptcy Having Occurred in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, or Norway (Sw. lag (1934:68) om verkan av
_konkurs, som intraffat i Danmark, Finland, Island eller Norge). Both acts still apply as between Sweden and_
Iceland. As between Sweden and Denmark and Sweden and Norway, the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention is
currently implemented by the Swedish Act on Bankruptcy Comprising Property in Another Nordic Country (Sw.
_lag (1981:6) om konkurs som omfattar egendom i annat nordiskt land) and the Swedish Act on Effects of_
Bankruptcy Having Occurred in Another Nordic Country (Sw. lag (1981:7) om verkan av konkurs som inträffat i
_annat nordiskt land). However, the E.U. Insolvency Regulation has replaced the convention as between Finland_
and Sweden. According to the Nordic Bankruptcy Convention a bankruptcy opened in any of the aforementioned
countries comprises all assets and liabilities of a bankrupt debtor located in any of these countries, and the
bankruptcy receiver is authorized to dispose of all the assets of the bankruptcy estate, regardless of such location.

Insolvency proceedings against an insolvent company may be initiated by a creditor or the company itself by
filing a petition for bankruptcy (Sw. konkurs) pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act (Sw. Konkurslagen
_(1987:672)), as amended (the “Swedish Bankruptcy Act”), to the competent district court (Sw. tingsrätt). Under_
Swedish law, a company that cannot pay its debts as they become due is deemed insolvent unless the inability is
merely temporary.

The insolvency laws of Sweden may not be as favorable to creditors as the insolvency laws of other jurisdictions,
including, inter alia, in respect of priority of creditors’ claims, the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the
duration of insolvency proceedings, and hence Swedish law may limit the ability of creditors to recover
payments due from a Swedish Guarantor to an extent exceeding the limitations arising under the insolvency laws
of other jurisdictions. The following sections “Insolvency proceedings”, “Priority of certain creditors”,
“Challengeable transactions,” and “Limitations on enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act”
includes a brief and limited description of certain aspects of the insolvency laws of Sweden.

**_Insolvency proceedings_**

In the event of bankruptcy, the court will appoint a receiver in bankruptcy (Sw. konkursförvaltare) who will work
in the interest of all creditors with the objective of selling the debtor’s assets and distribute the proceeds among
the creditors. All creditors (unless they have a right to separate an asset from the bankruptcy estate) wishing to
assert claims against the company that is declared bankrupt need to participate in the bankruptcy proceedings.
The purpose of bankruptcy proceedings is to wind up the company in such a way that the company’s creditors
receive as high a proportion of their claims as possible. The receiver in bankruptcy is required to safeguard the
assets and can decide to continue the business or to close it down, depending on what is best for all creditors. In
general, the receiver in bankruptcy is required to sell the assets of the debtor as soon as possible and to distribute
the proceeds in accordance with statutory rules. In the interim, the receiver will take over the management and
control of the company and the company’s directors and/or managing director will no longer be entitled to
represent the company or dispose of the company’s assets.

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in
bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts.
A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy or similar
proceedings is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfill the
company’s obligations according to a contract).

316


-----

When distributing the proceeds, the receiver must follow the mandatory provisions of the Swedish Rights of
Priority Act (Sw. Förmånsrättslag (170:979)) (the “Swedish Priority Act”, as amended, that states the order in
which creditors have a right to be paid. As a general principle, in bankruptcy proceedings competing claims have
equal right to payment in relation to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However,
preferential or secured creditors have the benefit of payment before other creditors. In case of enforcement
outside bankruptcy, an enforcement process is initiated by the creditor obtaining an enforcement order from the
Swedish Enforcement Authority (Sw. Kronofogdemyndigheten) or the court. Upon obtaining an enforcement
order against a debtor, a creditor may apply to the Swedish Enforcement Authority for enforcement of its claim.

**_Priority of certain creditors_**

As a general principle, under Swedish insolvency law competing claims have equal right to payment in relation
to the size of the amount claimed from the debtor’s assets. However, some preferential and secured creditors,
where such preference or security may arise as a consequence of law, have the benefit of payment before other
creditors. Pursuant to the Swedish Priority Act, there are two types of preferential rights: (i) specific, and
(ii) general preferential rights. Specific preferential rights apply to certain specific property and give the creditor
a right to payment from such property. Such preferential and secured creditors may also under certain
circumstances enforce the security in accordance with the Swedish Enforcement Act (Sw. Utsökningsbalk
_(1981:774)), or if the security is provided by way of a pledge on movable assets (Sw. handpanträtt), enforcement_
through private enforcement procedures as permitted pursuant to the Swedish Bankruptcy Act. General
preferential rights cover all property belonging to the insolvent company’s estate in bankruptcy, which is not
covered by specific preferential rights, and give the creditor a right to payment from such property. Claims that
do not carry any of the above mentioned preferential rights or exceed the value of the security provided for such
claim (to the extent of such excess), are non-preferential and are of equal standing as against each other (unless
subordinated). A claim can be subordinated if, for instance, the creditor has entered into an agreement with the
debtor stipulating such subordination. It should be noted that, in the case of bankruptcy, claims in relation to the
bankruptcy estate (a legal entity separate from the debtor) due, for example, to costs relating to the bankruptcy
(including fees payable to the receiver in bankruptcy), have priority over claims in relation to the debtor.

**_Challengeable transactions_**

In bankruptcy and company reorganization proceedings, transactions can (in certain circumstances and subject to
a time limit) be reversed and the goods or monies can then be returned to the bankruptcy estate or the company
subject to company reorganization. Broadly, these transactions include, among others, situations where the
debtor has conveyed property fraudulently or preferentially to one creditor to the detriment of its other creditors
before the initiation of the relevant insolvency proceedings, created a new security interest, granted a guarantee
or security that was either not stipulated at the time when the secured obligation arose or not perfected without
delay after such time and the delay is not considered to be ordinary, or paid a debt that is not due or that is
considerable compared to the value of the debtor’s assets or if the payment is made by using unusual means of
payment. In the majority of situations, a claim for recovery can be made concerning actions that were made
during the three or six months preceding the commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. In certain
situations, longer time limits apply and in others there are no time limits. These include, among others, situations
where the other party to an agreement or other arrangement is deemed to be a closely related party to the debtor
such as for example a subsidiary or parent company.

**_Limitations on enforceability due to the Swedish Reorganization Act_**

The Swedish Company Reorganization Act (Sw. Lag 1996:764 om företagsrekonstruktion), as amended (the
“Swedish Reorganization Act”) provides companies facing difficulty in meeting their payment obligations with
an opportunity to resolve these without being declared bankrupt. A petition for company reorganization may be
presented to the court by the debtor or a creditor, but a reorganization order may only be granted subject to the
debtor’s approval. Corporate reorganization proceedings shall, as a main rule, terminate within three months
from commencement but may under certain conditions be extended for up to one year.

317


-----

A declaration of bankruptcy does not automatically terminate existing contracts; instead, the receiver in
bankruptcy may in its discretion choose to have the bankruptcy estate itself step into any such existing contracts.
A clause in a contract which provides that the contract is terminated by reason of bankruptcy proceedings or
similar is likely to be unenforceable (the bankruptcy estate shall always be given a right to fulfill the company’s
obligations according to a contract).

An administrator is appointed by the court and supervises the day-to-day activities and safeguards the interests of
creditors as well as the debtor. However, the debtor remains in full possession of the business except that, for
important decisions such as paying a debt that has fallen due prior to the order of reorganization, granting
security for a debt that arose prior to the order, undertaking new obligations or transferring, pledging or granting
rights in respect of assets of a substantial value for the business, the consent of the administrator is required.
However, the absence of such consent does not affect the validity of the transaction (but may jeopardize the
reorganization).

Upon an order by the court under the Swedish Reorganization Act, the administrator must notify the creditors of
the reorganization proceedings and will draw up a reorganization plan specifying the proposed action to be taken
to resolve the debtor’s problems. A creditors’ meeting will be held at which the creditors will be given the
opportunity to express their opinions as to whether the reorganization should continue. Upon the request of any
of the creditors, the court shall appoint a creditors’ committee of at most three persons (in addition employee
representation may be appointed if the company has had certain average number of employees during its past
financial year and if specific reasons apply the court may appoint additional persons). The administrator shall, if
possible, consult with the creditors’ committee prior to taking any important decisions.

The making of an order under the Swedish Reorganization Act does not have the effect of terminating contracts
with the debtor. However, the opening of corporate reorganization proceedings entails limitations on the
contacting party’s right to terminate a contract due to the company’s delay in payment or performance. During
the reorganization procedure, the debtor’s business activities continue in the ordinary course of business.
However, the procedure includes a suspension of payments to creditors and the debtor cannot pay a debt that fell
due prior to the order without the consent of the administrator and such consent may only be granted should there
be exceptional reasons for doing so and any petition for bankruptcy in respect of the debtor will be stayed. A
moratorium also applies to execution in respect of a claim or enforcement of security during corporate
reorganization proceedings unless the security assets are in the physical possession of the secured creditor or any
agent acting on behalf of such creditor, which is the case with a share pledge over the shares in a Swedish limited
liability company where the share certificates of such company has been delivered to the agent and with a
Swedish law pledge over a loan governed by a negotiable debt instrument (Sw. löpande skuldebrev).

The debtor may apply to the court requesting public composition proceedings (Sw. offentligt ackord), which
means that the amount of a creditor’s claim may be reduced. The proposal for a public composition must meet
certain requirements such as that a sufficient proportion of the creditors which are allowed to vote, in respect of a
sufficient proportion of the outstanding claims vote in favor of such public composition. Creditors with set-off
rights and secured creditors will not participate in the composition unless they wholly or partly waive their
set-off rights or priority rights. Should the security not cover a secured creditor’s full claim, the remaining claim
will, however, be part of a composition. A creditors’ meeting is convened to vote on the proposed composition.
The public composition is binding on all creditors that were entitled to participate, i.e. creditors who have not
attended the creditors’ meeting will also be bound. However, the obligations of a guarantor under a guarantee
provided in respect of a creditor’s claim which has been reduced by way of public composition will not be
reduced correspondingly, but will remain valid up to the original amount of such creditor’s claim.

**_Co-Issuer_**

A SWEDISH LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AS ISSUER (A “SWEDISH ISSUER”) CANNOT BE
LIABLE FOR OTHER ISSUERS’ LIABILITIES AND/OR OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT SUCH

318


-----

LIABILITY WOULD INFRINGE THE SWEDISH COMPANIES ACT (SW. AKTIEBOLAGSLAG (2005:551))
AND THEREFORE ANY LIABILITY AND/OR OBLIGATION OF A SWEDISH ISSUER WILL BE
LIMITED TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE SWEDISH COMPANIES ACT (SW. AKTIEBOLAGSLAG
_(2005:551)). HENCE, PROVISIONS WILL BE INCLUDED STATING THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ANY_
OTHER PROVISION, A SWEDISH ISSUER’S LIABILITIES AND/OR OBLIGATIONS ARE LIMITED TO
THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE SWEDISH COMPANIES ACT (SW. AKTIEBOLAGSLAG (2005:551)). A
SWEDISH ISSUER CANNOT FOR EXAMPLE BE LIABLE AS ISSUER FOR OTHER ISSUERS’
LIABILITIES /AND OR OBLIGATIONS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN TO THE EXTENT IT COULD
HAVE GUARANTEED SUCH OBLIGATIONS (SEE BELOW “LIMITATIONS OF THE VALUE OF A
_GUARANTEE”). AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ABOVE, IT IS UNCERTAIN TO WHAT EXTENT THE_
SWEDISH ISSUER CAN AND IS PERMITTED TO (OTHER THAN TO REPAY FUNDS RECEIVED BY
AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SWEDISH ISSUER ITSELF UNDER THE ISSUE) PAY OR REPAY ANY
OBLIGATION RELATING TO ANY OTHER ISSUER OR FUNDS RECEIVED BY SUCH OTHER ISSUER.

**_Limitations on the value of a guarantee_**

Certain provisions of the Swedish Companies Act may limit the holders of the Notes’ right to payment from the
Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries.

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) a Swedish limited liability company
may not provide a guarantee for the obligations of a shareholder or a company under the control of a shareholder,
unless an exemption applies. One such exemption is that the guarantor and the parent or sister belong to the same
group of companies where the ultimate parent company of that group is domiciled within the European
Economic Area (EEA). Furthermore, if, at the time the guarantee is provided, the obligor of such obligation
could be deemed unable to fulfil its obligation to indemnify the Swedish company if the guarantee is utilized or
the security enforced such a guarantee would be permissible only to the extent the Swedish company receives a
commensurate corporate benefit. To the extent there is no commensurate corporate benefit for the guarantor,
such guarantee will be considered as a distribution of assets, which will be lawful only to the extent that,
following the provision of the guarantee, there is sufficient coverage for the restricted equity capital of the
Swedish limited liability company and considering the equity requirements imposed by the nature, scope, and
risks relating to the business of the company and the company’s consolidation needs, liquidity requirements, and
general financial position (i.e. at the time the guarantee is provided). It should also be noted that laws relating to
financial assistance in Sweden prohibit Swedish limited liability companies from providing guarantees or other
credit support for obligations of any person where such obligations are being incurred for the purpose of
acquiring shares in the company itself or in any other superior member (including any sister company) of the
same group of companies. The guarantees given by the guarantors incorporated under the laws of Sweden are
limited in accordance with the above restrictions relating to corporate benefit and financial assistance. To the
extent a guarantee is limited the obligations will not be guaranteed to the extent such limitations applies to the
obligations to be guaranteed.

**_Liquidation due to capital deficiency_**

Pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslag (2005:551)) whenever a company’s board of
directors has a reason to assume that, as a result of losses or reductions in the value of the company’s assets or
any other event, the company’s equity is less than half the registered share capital, the company’s board of
directors shall prepare a special balance sheet (Sw. kontrollbalansräkning) and have the auditors examine it. The
same obligation arises if the company in connection with enforcement pursuant to Chapter 4 of the Swedish
Enforcement Code (Sw. Utsökningsbalk (1981:774)) is found to lack seizeable assets.

If the special balance sheet shows that the equity of the company is less than half of the registered share capital,
the board of directors shall, as soon as possible, issue notice of a shareholders’ meeting which shall consider
whether the company shall go into liquidation (initial shareholders’ meeting). The special balance sheet and an
auditor’s report with respect thereto shall be presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting.

319


-----

If the special balance sheet presented at the initial shareholders’ meeting fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to the registered share capital and the initial shareholders’ meeting
has not resolved that the company shall go into liquidation, the shareholders’ meeting shall, within eight months
of the initial shareholders’ meeting, reconsider the issue whether the company shall go into liquidation (second
shareholders’ meeting). Prior to the second shareholders’ meeting, the board of directors shall prepare a new
special balance sheet and cause such to be reviewed by the company’s auditors. The new special balance sheet
and an auditor’s report thereon shall be presented at the second shareholders’ meeting.

A shareholders’ resolution on liquidation of the company shall be registered with the Swedish Companies
Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket), which shall appoint a liquidator. Should the shareholders not resolve on
such voluntary liquidation where required (which is where (i) a second shareholders’ meeting is not held within
the period of time stated above, or (ii) the new special balance sheet which was presented at the second
shareholders’ meeting was not reviewed by the company’s auditor or fails to show that, on the date of such
meeting, the equity of the company amounts to at least the registered share capital), the court may put the
company into compulsory liquidation and appoint a liquidator. The liquidator takes over management and control
of the company and shall sell the company’s assets and settle the company’s debts with the proceeds. The
liquidator shall give notice to the company’s unknown creditors and creditors that have not lodged their claims
within six months following such notice will have forfeited their rights to their claims.

**_Foreign currency_**

Whereas Swedish courts may award judgments in currencies other than Swedish Kronor, judgments will be
enforced in Swedish Kronor and a judgement debtor has the right to pay judgment debt in Swedish Kronor,
generally at the rate of exchange prevailing at the date of enforcement rather than at the date of judgment.

**_Trust_**

Currently, Swedish law does not contain any provisions for trusts to be formed and trustees to be appointed.
While Swedish law does not recognise the concept of trust, it is generally believed that a trustee appointed under
foreign law, provided that a trustee is capable of being appointed under the laws governing such appointment,
will be recognized and acknowledged in Sweden. However, such trustee will most likely not be able to hold
anything on trust in Sweden.

**_Stamp Duty_**

No Swedish stamp duty will be payable on the granting of the Guarantee by the Guarantor.

**_Parallel Debt_**

It is uncertain to what extent the concept of parallel debt is or will be recognized under Swedish law and an
agreement or document may not be valid, binding, and enforceable in respect of parallel debt.

**United States**

The U.S. Co-Issuer and certain subsidiaries are organized under the laws of the United States, have their
registered offices in the United States, and have property in the United States. In the event of insolvency,
insolvency proceedings may, therefore, be initiated in the United States. U.S. law would then govern those
proceedings. A voluntary bankruptcy case may be commenced by us, or an involuntary bankruptcy case could be
commenced by certain unsecured creditors as provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

**_Fraudulent transfer_**

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer and fraudulent conveyance
laws, the Issuers or the Guarantors (each, an “Obligor”) may avoid a transfer of an interest of the Obligors in

320


-----

property (including any payments due on the Notes and the grant of any security interest) or an obligation
incurred by the Obligors (including the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees) as a
fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance if the Obligor, among other things,

   - Made such transfer or incurrence with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which
the Obligor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was
incurred, indebted; or

   - Received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation and (1) was
insolvent on the date such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or became insolvent as a
result of such transfer or obligation; (2) was engaged in business or a transaction for which any property
remaining with the Obligor was an unreasonably small capital, or (3) the Obligor intended to incur, or
believed it would incur, debts that would be beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured.

Generally, an Obligor would be considered insolvent if, at the time such transfer or incurrence was made, (1) the
sum of the Obligor’s debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the value of its assets; (2) the value
of the Obligor’s assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay the Obligor’s probable liability on
its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they mature, or (3) the Obligor could not pay its debts as
they become due. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not an
Obligor was solvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that such transfer or
incurrence would not be subordinated to the Obligor’s other debts.

**_Preferences_**

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state preferences laws, the Obligors may avoid any
transfer of an interest of the Obligors in property (including any payments due on the Notes and the grant of any
security interest) to or for the benefit of a creditor as a preference, if, among other things, such transfer was made
(1) for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by the Obligor before such transfer was made; (2) while the
Obligor was insolvent; and (3) on or within 90 days before the Obligor filed for bankruptcy; and such transfer
enables (4) such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if the Obligor had filed for chapter 7
liquidation and such transfer had not been made.

**_Other actions_**

As a court of equity, a bankruptcy court in the United States may subordinate the claims of a holder of the Notes
in respect of the Notes or other claims against any Obligor under the principle of equitable subordination, if the
court determines that: (1) such holder engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (2) such inequitable conduct
resulted in injury to other creditors of the Obligor or conferred an unfair advantage on such holder, and
(3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with other provisions of federal bankruptcy law.

**_The automatic stay_**

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce the Obligors payment obligations under the Notes and the Guarantee
and its security interests against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indenture
governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable federal bankruptcy law if one or more of
the Obligors becomes a debtor in a case under federal bankruptcy law. Upon the commencement of a case under
federal bankruptcy law, the automatic stay (1) operates as a stay of the commencement or continuation of any
judicial or administrative proceeding against the Obligor that was, or could have been, commenced before the
commencement of such a case and (2) prohibits a secured creditor, such as a holder of Notes, from commencing
or continuing any act to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the bankruptcy estate, including
any Collateral. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could therefore prevent
the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the Collateral or commencing any
action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral. The automatic stay could be

321


-----

lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to any
creditor’s request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court may deny such a request.

**_Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process_**

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its
property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession,” subject to certain
limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a
chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee
remains in possession of the debtor’s property. Moreover, federal bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue
to retain and use collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided
that, upon the secured creditor’s request, the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the
debtor’s property. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include
making periodic cash payments, providing an additional, or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case
to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the pendency of
the bankruptcy case as a result of, among other things, the use, sale or lease of such collateral or the imposition of
the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to
circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to adequate
protection for a decrease in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt
that it secures.

Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a
plan within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first 180 days of the case by
each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge
these periods for cause upon request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18
months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter
11 filing. During these “exclusivity periods,” other parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded from
proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans.

In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusivity
periods and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it may be impossible to predict whether or
when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests; the value of the collateral at the time of the
bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; and whether or to what extent
holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the
requirement of “adequate protection.”

**_A debtor-in-possession may obtain new credit secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens_**

Federal bankruptcy law permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension of
new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and
circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured
by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens, provided that, among other things, there is adequate protection
of the interests of the holders of the existing liens. In other words, it is possible that, in connection with a chapter
11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is
secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens under the Notes and any other liens that exist at the time of
the chapter 11 filing.

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any future bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors could possibly assert that the fair
market value of the collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the
then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by a bankruptcy court that the Notes are under
322


-----

collateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes could be bifurcated between a
secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim may not be entitled to the benefits of security in
the collateral. In the event of a bankruptcy case the holders of the Notes will be entitled to post-petition interest
under federal bankruptcy law only if the value of their security interest in the collateral is greater than their
pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes may be deemed to have an unsecured claim if the obligation under
the Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the collateral securing the Notes. Holders of the Notes that
have a security interest in the collateral with a value equal to or less than their pre-bankruptcy claim may not be
entitled to post-petition interest under the under federal bankruptcy law.

**_Ability to confirm a chapter 11 plan notwithstanding the dissenting votes of creditors_**

Under federal bankruptcy law, a chapter 11 plan can be imposed on a creditor or an equityholder (or class of
creditors or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive
treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for
the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those
classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan are entitled vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of
claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to have accepted the
plan. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled to vote on the plan
and are deemed to have rejected the plan. A class of claims is deemed to have accepted the plan if creditors
holding at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the claims of such class accept the
plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that
accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be
confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of federal
bankruptcy law, which require, among other things, that one impaired class has accepted the plan and that the
plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that
is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm
its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**Service of process and enforcement of civil liabilities**

**Brazil**

Subject to specific requirements described below, a final conclusive judgment for civil liabilities rendered by any
foreign court in respect of the Notes would be recognized in the courts of Brazil (to the extent that Brazilian
courts may have jurisdiction) and such courts would enforce such judgment without reconsideration of the merits
of the original action only upon recognition of that judgment by the Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (Superior
_Tribunal de Justiça). That recognition will occur, according to Article 105, item I, “i”, of the Brazilian Federal_
Constitution, Article 963 of the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure and Amendment 18 do the Internal Rules
(Regimento Interno) of the Superior Court of Justice, as amended, only if the foreign judgment:

   - fulfills all formalities required for its enforceability under the laws of the country where the foreign
judgment is granted;

   - is issued by a competent court after proper service of process is made in accordance with the applicable
law, which service must comply with Brazilian law if made in Brazil, or after sufficient evidence of the
parties’ absence has been given, as required by applicable law;

   - is final and therefore not subject to appeal;

   - is for the payment of a certain sum of money;

   - is apostilled by a competent authority of the State from which the document emanates according to the
Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign Public
Documents or, if such State is not signatory of the Hague Convention, is duly authenticated by a
competent Brazilian consulate;

   - is accompanied by a translation into Portuguese made by a certified translator in Brazil, unless an
exemption is provided by an international treaty to which Brazil is a signatory;

   - is not contrary to Brazilian national sovereignty or public policy or violate the dignity of the human
person (as set forth in Brazilian law);

   - does not conflict with a previous final and binding judgment on the same matter and involving the same
parties issued by a Brazilian court (res judicata); and

   - does not violate the exclusive jurisdiction of Brazilian courts.

The judicial recognition process may be time consuming and may also give rise to difficulties in enforcing the
foreign judgment in Brazil. Accordingly, it is not possible to assure that confirmation will be obtained, that the
process described above will be conducted in a timely manner or that Brazilian courts will enforce a monetary
judgment for violation of the federal securities laws of the United States or other jurisdictions outside Brazil with
respect to the Notes.

The Issuers have also been advised that:

   - civil actions may be brought before Brazilian courts based on the federal securities laws of the United
States or other jurisdiction outside Brazil and that, subject to applicable law, Brazilian courts may
enforce liability arising from such actions against a Brazilian guarantor (provided that provisions of the
federal securities laws of the United States or other jurisdiction outside Brazil do not contravene
Brazilian public policy, good morals, national sovereignty or public morality and provided further that
Brazilian courts can assert jurisdiction over the particular action); and

   - the ability of a judgment creditor to satisfy a judgment by attaching certain assets of the defendant in
Brazil is governed and limited by provisions of Brazilian law to the extent that assets are located in
Brazil.

A plaintiff, whether Brazilian or non-Brazilian, who resides outside Brazil or is outside Brazil during the course
of litigation in Brazil and who does not own real estate property in Brazil during the course of litigation must

324


-----

post a bond to guarantee the payment of the defendant’s legal fees and court expenses, including attorney fees, as
established under Article 83 of the Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure, except in the case of (1) enforcement
actions based on an instrument that may be enforced in Brazilian courts without the review of its merit (título
_executivo extrajudicial); (2) enforcement of a judgment, including foreign judgments; (3) counterclaims or in the_
cases that this guarantee is waived by a provision contained in an international treaty or agreement to which
Brazil is party; or (4) in the event of an international agreement ratified by Brazil that does not require the
obligation to post a bond.

If proceedings are brought in the courts of Brazil seeking to enforce obligations against Brazilian companies,
payment shall be made in reais. Any judgment rendered in Brazilian courts in respect of any payment obligations
is payable in reais.

**Canada**

A court of competent jurisdiction in the province of Ontario (a “Canadian Court”) would give a judgment based
upon a final and conclusive in personam judgment of any federal or state court located in the United States (a
“U.S. Court”) for a sum certain, obtained against a Canadian guarantor with respect to a claim arising out of its
guarantee of the notes under the indenture (a “U.S. Judgment”), without reconsideration of the merits, if the U.S.
Court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction over the guarantor, as recognized by a Canadian Court (and
submission in the indenture to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of a U.S. Court will be sufficient for that purpose),
provided that (i) an action to enforce the U.S. Judgment is commenced in the Canadian Court within any
applicable limitation period, (ii) the Canadian Court has discretion to stay or decline to hear an action on the U.S.
Judgment if the U.S. Judgment is under appeal or there is another subsisting judgment in any jurisdiction relating
to the same cause of action as the U.S. Judgment; (iii) the Canadian Court will render judgment only in Canadian
dollars, and (iv) an action in the Canadian Court on the U.S. Judgment may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, or other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally; and (v) subject to the defenses
(A) that the U.S. Judgment was obtained by fraud or in a manner contrary to the principles of natural justice,
(B) that the U.S. Judgment is for a claim which under the laws of the province of Ontario would be characterized
as based on a foreign revenue, expropriatory, penal, or other public law, (C) that the U.S. Judgment is contrary to
public policy (as the term is understood under the laws of the province of Ontario) or to an order made by the
Attorney General of Canada under the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act (Canada) or by the Competition
Tribunal under the Competition Act (Canada) in respect of certain judgments referred to in these statutes, or
(D) that the U.S. Judgment has been satisfied or is void under the applicable U.S. federal or state laws.

**Denmark**

The United States and Denmark do not currently have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgement rendered by an U.S.
federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities
laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in Denmark.

A final judgement properly obtained in a U.S. federal or state court would therefore not be recognized nor
enforced by the Danish courts without re-examination of the substantive matters thereby adjudicated. In
connection with any such re-examination, such judgement would generally be accepted as material evidence, but
the parties must provide the Danish courts with satisfactory information about the contents of the relevant foreign
law and, if they fail to do so, the Danish courts may apply Danish law instead.

Further, certain remedies available under U.S. federal or state law may not be allowed in Danish courts, i.e. if
they are contrary to Danish public policy, including, among other, punitive damages. The Danish courts may
award damages only to the extent necessary to compensate for actual economic losses. Similarly, procedural
remedies, including specific rules on the taking of evidence such as the rules on “discovery” in the U.S., may not
be available in legal proceedings before Danish courts.

325


-----

Similarly to the above, there can be no certainty that the Danish courts will enforce court judgements or orders
obtained in the United States against any of the Danish Guarantor’s directors, officers, or other executives, or that
Danish courts will otherwise entertain actions in other jurisdictions.

Foreign arbitral awards against a Danish Guarantor (or against any of its directors, officers, or other executives)
may be enforced in Denmark under the 1958 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Arbitral Awards and the 2005 Danish Arbitration Act.

The directors, officers and other executives of the Danish Guarantors may not be residents or citizens of the
United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United
States upon the Danish Guarantors or such persons or to enforce against them judgments of U.S. courts
predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. federal or state securities laws, even if the Danish
Guarantors have appointed, or will appoint, an agent for the service of process in New York.

**Germany**

There are uncertainties as to the enforceability in Germany of civil liabilities based on U.S. federal or state
securities laws, either in an original action or in an action to enforce a judgment obtained in U.S. federal or state
courts. The United States and Germany currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a
final judgment by any U.S. federal or state court for payment, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal
or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Germany. A final judgment by a U.S. federal
or state court, however, may be recognized and enforced in Germany in an action before a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with the proceedings set forth by the German Code of Civil Procedure
(Zivilprozessordnung). In such an action, a German court generally would not reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by a U.S. federal or state court, except as noted below. The recognition and enforcement
of a U.S. judgment by a German court would be conditional upon a number of factors, including the following:

   - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceeding under German law;

   - the document commencing the proceedings was duly served and made known to the defendant in a
timely manner that allowed for adequate defense, or in case of non-compliance with such requirement,
(i) the defendant does not invoke such non-compliance or (ii) has nevertheless appeared in the
proceedings;

   - the judgment is not contrary to (i) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a German court
or (ii) any judgment which became res judicata rendered by a foreign court which is recognized in
Germany and the procedure leading to the applicable judgment does not contradict any such judgment
under (i) and (ii) or a proceeding previously commenced in Germany;

   - the effects of its recognition will not be in conflict with material principles of German law, including,
without limitation, fundamental rights under the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany
(Grundrechte) and German public policy (ordre public). In this context, it should be noted that any
component of a U.S. federal or state court civil judgment awarding punitive damages or any other
damages which do not serve a compensatory purpose, such as treble damages, will not be enforced in
Germany. They are considered to be in conflict with material principles of German law;

   - the reciprocity of enforcement of judgments is guaranteed; and

   - the judgment became res judicata in accordance with the law of the place where it was pronounced.

Subject to the foregoing, purchasers of securities may be able to enforce judgments in civil and commercial
matters obtained from U.S. federal or state courts in Germany. We cannot, however, assure you that attempts to
enforce judgments in Germany will be successful.

326


-----

German civil procedure differs substantially from U.S. civil procedure in a number of respects. With respect to
the production of evidence, for example, U.S. federal and state law and the laws of several other jurisdictions
based on common law provide for pre-trial discovery, a process by which parties to the proceedings may prior to
trial compel the production of documents by adverse or third parties and the deposition of witnesses. Evidence
obtained in this manner may be decisive in the outcome of any proceeding. No such pre-trial discovery process
exists under German law, but only the concept of the burden of proof (Beweislastumkehr) under certain
circumstances.

If the party in whose favor such final judgment by a federal or state court of the United States is rendered brings
a new lawsuit in a competent court in Germany, such party may submit to the German court the final judgment
rendered in the United States. Under such circumstances, a judgment by a federal or state court of the United
States against the Issuers or such persons will be regarded by a German court only as evidence of the outcome of
the dispute to which such judgment relates. A German court may choose to re-hear the dispute and may render a
judgment not in line with the judgment rendered by a federal or state court of the United States.

**The Netherlands**

The Dutch Co-Issuer and the Dutch Guarantors are incorporated under Dutch law and have their registered seat
in the Netherlands. None of the directors of the Dutch Co-Issuer reside in the United States and a substantial
amount of the Dutch Co-Issuer’s assets, and a substantial amount of the assets of the Dutch Co-Issuer and Dutch
Guarantors’ directors are located outside of the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to
effect service of process upon the Dutch Co-Issuer or a Dutch Guarantor or such persons.

Furthermore, the United States and the Netherlands currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitration awards, in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any court in any federal or state court in
the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. securities laws, would not
automatically be recognized or enforceable in the Netherlands. In order to obtain a judgment which is
enforceable in the Netherlands, the claim must be re-litigated before a competent Dutch court and the judgment
rendered by the foreign court must be submitted in the course of such proceedings, in which case the Dutch court
will have to decide whether and to what extent it, given the circumstances of the case, will recognize the foreign
judgment. A Dutch court will, under current practice, generally grant the same judgment without relitigation on
the merits if (a) that judgment results from proceedings compatible with the Dutch concept of due process,
(b) that judgment does not contravene public policy (openbare orde) of the Netherlands, (c) the jurisdiction of
the foreign court has been based on an internationally acceptable ground and (d) the judgment by the foreign
court is not incompatible with a judgment rendered between the same parties by a Dutch court, or with an earlier
judgment rendered between the same parties by a non-Dutch court in a dispute that concerns the same subject
and is based on the same cause.

Subject to the foregoing and provided that service of process occurs in accordance with applicable treaties,
investors may be able to enforce in the Netherlands, judgments in civil and commercial matters obtained from
U.S. federal or state courts. However, no assurance can be given that such judgments will be enforceable. In
addition, it is doubtful whether a Dutch court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability in an original
action commenced in the Netherlands and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, a Dutch
court may reduce the amount of damages granted by a U.S. court and recognize damages only to the extent that
they are necessary to compensate actual losses or damages. The enforcement and recognition of judgments of
U.S. courts in the Netherlands are subject to the Dutch rules of civil procedure.

**Sweden**

It is not established under Swedish law if a power of attorney or a mandate of agency, including the appointment
of a service of process agent, can be made irrevocable and therefore any powers of attorney or mandates of

327


-----

agency issued by a Swedish party can be revoked and will terminate by operation of law and without notice at the
bankruptcy or temporal demise of the Swedish party giving such powers.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 12 December 2012, on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial
matters (the “2012 Brussels Regulation”), a judgment entered against a company incorporated in Sweden (a
“Swedish Party”) in the courts of a Member State (as defined therein, i.e. all Member States of the European
Union) and which is enforceable in such a Member State, will be directly enforceable in Sweden upon the
satisfaction of the formal requirements of the 2012 Brussels Regulation without any declaration of enforceability
being required. It should be noted, however, that a party may apply for refusal of recognition or refusal of
enforcement, as applicable, in accordance with the 2012 Brussels Regulation. Such an application shall be
submitted to the relevant district court (Sw. tingsrätt).

Pursuant to the 2012 Brussels Regulation, if a judgment contains a measure or an order which is not known under
the laws of the Member State in which the recognition of the judgment is invoked or in which the enforcement of
the judgment, the court settlement or the authentic instrument is sought, that measure or order shall, to the extent
possible, be adapted to a measure or order known under the laws of that Member State which has equivalent
effects attached to it and which pursues similar aims and interests.

Pursuant to the provisions of the 2007 Lugano Convention on the Recognition of Judgments in Civil and
Commercial Matters (the “Lugano Convention”), a judgment entered against a Swedish Party in the courts of a
Contracting Party (as defined in the Lugano Convention) and which is enforceable in such a Contracting Party,
will, provided that a motion for enforcement has been filed and granted with the relevant district court, be
enforceable in Sweden if it meets the formal requirements under the Lugano Convention. Judgments entered
against any Swedish party in the courts of a state which is not a member state under the terms of the 2012
Brussels Regulation or a contracting state under the terms of the Lugano Convention, e.g., the United States of
America, would not be recognized or enforceable in Sweden as a matter of law without retrial on its merits.
Therefore, a final judgment for payment of money rendered by a federal or state court in the United States in
civil and commercial matters, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, or by
the courts of any other such state, would not be directly enforceable, either in whole or in part, in Sweden.

In order to enforce any such judgement in Sweden, proceedings must therefore be initiated by way of civil law
action on the judgment debt before a court of competent jurisdiction in Sweden. In such an action, a judgment
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States, or by the courts of any other such state, may be
regarded as evidence of, for example, factual circumstances or the content of U.S. law or other relevant foreign
law but the competent Swedish authority may also choose to rehear the dispute ab initio.

Any legal proceedings in the courts of Sweden will be conducted in Swedish and a court or enforcement
authority in Sweden may require, as a further condition for admissibility and/or enforceability the translation into
Swedish of any relevant document, and assistance from Swedish authorities in the service of process in
connection with foreign proceedings might require the observance of certain procedural and other regulations.

**Material Netherlands tax consequences**

This summary solely addresses the principal Dutch tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership, and disposal
of Notes and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder. Tax
matters are complex, and the tax consequences of the offer to a particular holder of Notes will depend in part on
such holder’s circumstances. Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult his own tax advisor for a full
understanding of the tax consequences of the offer to him, including the applicability and effect of Dutch tax
laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Dutch concepts, the meaning to be
attributed to such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Dutch concepts
under Dutch tax law. Where in this summary the terms “the Netherlands” and “Dutch” are used, these refer
solely to the European part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. This summary assumes that the Issuer is
organized, and that its business will be conducted, in the manner outlined in this Offering Memorandum. A
change to such organizational structure or to the manner in which the Issuer conducts its business may invalidate
the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect any such change.

This summary is based on the tax law of the Netherlands (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the
date of this Offering Memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes,
possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be
updated to reflect such change.

The summary in this Material Netherlands tax consequences does not address the Dutch tax consequences for a
holder of Notes who:

(i) is a person who may be deemed an owner of Notes for Dutch tax purposes pursuant to specific statutory
attribution rules in Dutch tax law;

(ii) is, although in principle subject to Dutch corporation tax, in whole or in part, specifically exempt from that
tax in connection with income from Notes;

(iii) is an investment institution as defined in the Dutch Corporation Tax Act 1969;

(iv) owns Notes in connection with a membership of a management board or a supervisory board, an
employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role;

(v) has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in any or more of the Issuers for
Dutch tax purposes. Generally, a person holds a substantial interest if (a) such person – either alone or, in
the case of an individual, together with his partner or any of his relatives by blood or by marriage in the
direct line (including foster-children) or of those of his partner for Dutch tax purposes – owns or is deemed
to own, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the shares or of any class of shares of any or more of the
Issuers, or rights to acquire, directly or indirectly, such an interest in the shares of any or more of the
Issuers or profit participating certificates relating to 5% or more of the annual profits or to 5% or more of
the liquidation proceeds of any or more of the Issuers, or (b) such person’s shares, rights to acquire shares
or profit participating certificates in any or more of Issuers are held by him following the application of a
non-recognition provision; or

(vi) is a corporate entity or taxable as a corporate entity and who is resident or deemed to be resident of Aruba,
Curaçao or Sint Maarten for tax purposes.

**Withholding tax**

All payments under the Notes may be made free from withholding or deduction of or for any taxes of whatever
nature imposed, levied, withheld, or assessed by the Netherlands or any political subdivision or taxing authority
of or in the Netherlands.

329


-----

**Taxes on income and capital gains**

Resident holders of Notes

A holder of Notes who is resident or deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes is fully
subject to Dutch income tax if he is an individual or fully subject to Dutch corporation tax if it is a corporate
entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate entity, as
described in the summary below.

_Individuals deriving profits or deemed to be deriving profits from an enterprise_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that are attributable to an
enterprise from which an individual derives profits, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to
the net value of an enterprise, other than as a shareholder, are generally subject to Dutch income tax at
progressive rates up to 51.95%.

_Individuals deriving benefits from miscellaneous activities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that constitute benefits from
miscellaneous activities by an individual are generally subject to Dutch income tax at progressive rates up to
51.95%.

An individual may, inter alia, derive or be deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Notes that are
taxable as benefits from miscellaneous activities if his investment activities go beyond regular active portfolio
management.

_Other individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual whose situation has not been discussed before in this section “ Material
Netherlands tax consequences—Taxes on income and capital gains—Resident holders of Notes”, the value of his
Notes forms part of the yield basis for purposes of tax on benefits from savings and investments. A deemed
benefit, which is determined on the basis of progressive rates starting from 2.02% up to 5.38% per annum of this
yield basis, is taxed at the rate of 30%. Actual benefits derived from or in connection with his Notes are not
subject to Dutch income tax.

_Corporate entities_

Any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes that are held by a corporate
entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership, and a mutual fund, taxable as a corporate entity, are
generally subject to Dutch corporation tax.

_General_

A holder of Notes will not be deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for Dutch tax purposes by reason only of
the execution and/or enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Notes or the performance by the Issuer
of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes.

330


-----

Non-resident holders of Notes

_Individuals_

If a holder of Notes is an individual who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for
purposes of Dutch income tax, he will not be subject to Dutch income tax in respect of any benefits derived or
deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes, except if:

(i) he derives profits from an enterprise, whether as an entrepreneur or pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net
value of such enterprise, other than as a shareholder, and such enterprise is carried on, in whole or in part,
through a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands, and his Notes are
attributable to such permanent establishment or permanent representative; or

(ii) he derives benefits or is deemed to derive benefits from or in connection with Notes that are taxable as
benefits from miscellaneous activities performed in the Netherlands.

_Corporate entities_

If a holder of Notes is a corporate entity, or an entity, including an association, a partnership and a mutual fund,
taxable as a corporate entity, which is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands for purposes
of Dutch corporation tax, it will not be subject to Dutch corporation tax in respect of any benefits derived or
deemed to be derived from or in connection with Notes, except if:

(i) it derives profits from an enterprise directly which is carried on, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands, and to which permanent establishment or
permanent representative its Notes are attributable; or

(ii) it derives profits pursuant to a co-entitlement to the net value of an enterprise which is managed in the
Netherlands, other than as a holder of securities, and to which enterprise its Notes are attributable.

_General_

If a holder of Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in the Netherlands, such holder will for Dutch
tax purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a permanent
establishment or a permanent representative in the Netherlands by reason only of the execution and/or
enforcement of the documents relating to the issue of Notes or the performance by the Issuer of its obligations
under such documents or under the Notes.

**Gift and inheritance taxes**

No Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax will arise with respect to an acquisition or deemed acquisition of
Notes by way of gift by, or upon the death of, a holder of Notes who is neither resident nor deemed to be resident
in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch inheritance tax except if, in the event of a gift whilst
not being a resident nor being a deemed resident in the Netherlands for purposes of Dutch gift tax or Dutch
inheritance tax, the holder of Notes becomes a resident or a deemed resident in the Netherlands and dies within
180 days after the date of the gift.

For purposes of Dutch gift tax and Dutch inheritance tax, a gift of Notes made under a condition precedent is
deemed to be made at the time the condition precedent is satisfied.

331


-----

**Registration taxes and duties**

No Dutch registration tax, transfer tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty, other than court
fees, is payable in the Netherlands in respect of or in connection with the execution and/or enforcement
(including by legal proceedings and including the enforcement of any foreign judgment in the courts of the
Netherlands) of the documents relating to the issue of Notes, the performance by the Issuer of its obligations
under such documents or under Notes, or the transfer of Notes, except that Dutch real property transfer tax may
be due upon an acquisition, in connection with Notes, of real property situated in the Netherlands, (an interest in)
an asset that qualifies as real property situated in the Netherlands, or (an interest in) a right over real property
situated in the Netherlands, for the purposes of Dutch real property transfer tax.

**Material Swedish tax consequences**

The following summary is intended as general information only, and it does not present any comprehensive or
complete description of all aspects of Swedish tax law which could be of relevance to a holder of the Notes
offered hereby (a “Noteholder”) and to payments under the Guarantees, such as:

   - when the Notes are held as current asset (inventory) in a business;

   - when the Notes are held by partnerships (handels- eller kommanditbolag);

   - foreign enterprises maintaining a permanent establishment in Sweden;

   - when the Notes are held in a capital insurance (kapitalförsäkring) or an investment savings account
(investeringssparkonto);

   - rules regarding reporting obligations for, amongst others, payers of interest;

   - enterprises treated as investment companies or insurance companies for Swedish tax purposes;

   - currency exchange gains or losses; and

   - credit of foreign taxes.

The taxation of the prospective Noteholders depends on their individual circumstances and prospective
Noteholders should thus consult their tax adviser regarding the tax consequences (including the applicability and
effect of tax treaties for the avoidance of double taxation) of any purchase, ownership, or disposal of the Notes
offered hereby.

The following summary is based on Swedish tax law as applied and interpreted by Swedish tax courts and as
published and in effect on the date hereof, without prejudice to any amendments introduced at a later date and
implemented with or without retroactive effect.

For the purpose of this section, “Swedish Taxes” shall mean taxes of whatever nature levied by or on behalf of
Sweden or any taxing authority of or in Sweden. Sweden means the Kingdom of Sweden, located in Europe.

**Individuals resident in Sweden for tax purposes (capital income)**

The description of certain Swedish tax consequences in this section is only intended for individuals who are
resident or deemed to be resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and are not engaged in business activities
to which the Notes are attributable.

Income related to interest or capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes offered hereby is taxed
as capital income, subject to a fixed rate of 30 percent. As a general rule, 70 percent of a capital loss is deductible
against any other taxable income from capital. However, capital losses on listed Swedish receivables are fully
deductible in the income from capital category. According to Swedish case law, full deductibility also applies to
capital losses on listed foreign receivables.

To the extent that the individual reports net negative capital income, reduction of tax on employment and
business income as well as the reduction of real estate tax is allowed. The tax reduction equals 30 percent of the
net negative capital income up to an amount of SEK 100,000 and 21 percent for any net negative capital income
in excess of SEK 100,000. Deficits may not be carried forward to a subsequent fiscal year.

If amounts that are considered to be interest for Swedish tax purposes are paid by a legal entity domiciled in
Sweden (including a Swedish branch) to an individual (or an estate of a deceased individual) tax resident in
Sweden, Swedish preliminary taxes are normally withheld at a rate of 30 percent. Swedish preliminary taxes
should normally also be withheld on other return on the Notes (but not capital gains), if the return is paid out
together with such a payment of interest referred to above.

333


-----

**Individuals resident in Sweden for tax purposes (business income)**

The description of certain Swedish tax consequences in this section is only intended for individuals who are
resident or deemed to be resident in Sweden for Swedish tax purposes and are engaged in business activities to
which the Notes are attributable.

Swedish individuals are generally subject to income tax at statutory progressive rates with a maximum of
61 percent with respect to any income or capital gains derived or deemed to be derived from the Notes offered
hereby (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) that are attributable to business activities.

**Swedish corporate entities**

Swedish corporate entities are generally subject to corporate income tax at the statutory rate of 22 percent
(reduced to 21.4 percent in 2019 and then further reduced to 20.6 percent in 2021) with respect to any interest or
capital gains derived or deemed to be derived (including any capital gains realized on the disposal thereof) of the
Notes offered hereby.

**Noteholders not resident in Sweden**

A Noteholder, other than a Swedish individual or Swedish corporate entity, will not be subject to any Swedish
Taxes, including withholding tax, on income or capital gains in respect of the ownership and disposal of the
Notes offered hereby, except if the Noteholder, whether an individual or not, derives profits from an enterprise
which is, in whole or in part, carried on through a permanent establishment in Sweden, to which the Notes
offered hereby are attributable.

**Certain U.S. federal income tax consequences**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to the purchase,
ownership, and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), United States
Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) rulings and pronouncements and
judicial decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change at any time. Any such change may be applied
retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder of the Notes. We have not sought and do not intend
to seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS
will not take positions concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of the Notes
that are different from those discussed below or that any such positions would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules under U.S. federal income tax laws, such
as:

   - banks, thrifts and other financial institutions;

   - controlled foreign corporations, passive foreign investment companies and corporations that accumulate
earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

   - U.S. expatriates;

   - insurance companies;

   - dealers in securities or currencies and traders in securities that have elected the mark-to-market method
of accounting for their securities;

   - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or other pass-through entities for U.S. federal income tax
purposes or investors in such entities;

   - U.S. holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

   - holders subject to the alternative minimum tax;

   - tax-exempt organizations or governmental organizations;

   - regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts;

   - persons holding the Notes as a part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated
transaction; and

   - persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the
Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement.

In the case of a holder of the Notes that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax
treatment of an owner of such entity generally will depend upon the tax status of the owner and the activities of
the entity. Owners of an entity that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holding the
Notes should consult their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of the entity’s purchase, ownership and
disposition of the Notes.

In addition, this discussion is limited to persons purchasing the Notes for cash at original issue and at their
respective “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial
amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or
organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers) and deals only with Notes
held as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code. Moreover, the effect of other U.S. federal
tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws), the Medicare contribution tax, or any applicable, state, local, or
foreign tax laws is not discussed.

335


-----

**This discussion is for informational purposes only and is not tax advice. Persons considering the purchase**
**of the Notes should consult their own advisors concerning the application of U.S. federal income, estate**
**and gift tax laws, as well as the laws of any state, local, or foreign taxing jurisdiction, to their particular**
**situations.**

**Effect of co-issuance and source of interest**

The portion, if any, of the proceeds of the Notes that will be borrowed by the U.S. Co-Issuer and the portion, if
any, of the proceeds of the Notes that will be borrowed by the Dutch Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Borrower, in
each case, will be posted on the website of an Issuer or of a direct or indirect parent of an Issuer or on a
non-public, password-protected website maintained by any of the Issuers, a direct or indirect parent of an Issuer,
or a third party, in the manner described under “Description of Notes—Certain covenants—Reports and other
_information” in a notice setting forth such amounts. Any subsequent changes to such allocation shall promptly be_
posted in the same manner. Each Issuer intends to repay the interest and principal associated with the proceeds it
will borrow.

Although the Notes will be co-issued by the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Dutch Co-Issuer and, after its accession as an
obligor under the Indenture, the Swedish Co-Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer will be liable for repayment of the
Notes in their entirety, for U.S. federal income tax purposes the Issuers intend, and by acquiring an interest in the
Notes each beneficial owner of a Note agrees, to treat the U.S. Co-Issuer, the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Swedish
Co-Issuer, respectively, as the issuer of only the portion, if any, of the debt borrowed by each such Issuer, and the
remainder of this discussion assumes such treatment. Each Issuer intends to pay interest and principal due on the
portion, if any, that it borrows. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, if a debt obligation has both U.S. and
non-U.S. co-issuers, there is some uncertainty as to the determination of the sourcing of an interest payment on
such debt obligation. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the sourcing
of an interest payment on a Note will be made by reference to the residence of the Issuer that makes the payment.
Accordingly, the remainder of this discussion assumes that an interest payment on a Note made by the U.S.
Co-Issuer will be treated as U.S. source income and an interest payment on a Note made by the Dutch Co-Issuer
or the Swedish Co-Issuer be treated as foreign source income. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS
will not challenge this treatment, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS
with respect to the treatment of the Notes or the sourcing of the interest payments on the Notes. If the Notes were
treated in a different manner or the interest payments on the Notes were sourced in a different manner, the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to a holder would be different than those described below. You should consult
your tax advisors as to the treatment of the Notes and the sourcing of interest payments on the Notes.

**U.S. holders**

The following discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a “U.S. holder,”
which means a beneficial owner of a Note who or that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

   - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

   - a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the
United States, any of its states or the District of Columbia;

   - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

   - a trust that (i) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court and the control of one or more
“United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code), or (ii) has a valid
election in effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Certain U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder other than a U.S. holder are discussed
separately below.

336


-----

**_Stated interest_**

Stated interest on a Note (together with any Additional Amounts and any tax withheld from the interest payment)
will generally be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in accordance with
the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. It is intended, and this
discussion assumes, that the Notes are issued without original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

**_Interest denominated in Euro_**

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and that receives a
payment of stated interest on the Euro Notes will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S.
dollar value of the Euro interest payment (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such
payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at such time. A cash
method U.S. holder will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such
stated interest, but may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the Euros so received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will be required to
include in income (as ordinary income) the U.S. dollar value of the Euro interest payment in accordance with
either of two methods. Under the first method, the U.S. dollar value of such Euro-denominated accrued stated
interest will be determined by translating such amount at the average spot rate of exchange for the accrual period
or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average spot rate of exchange for the
partial period within each taxable year. Under the second method, an accrual basis U.S. holder may elect to
translate such accrued stated interest income into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the last day of
the interest accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, using the spot rate of
exchange on the last day of the part of the period within each taxable year. Alternatively, if the last day of an
accrual period is within five business days of the date of receipt of the accrued stated interest, a U.S. holder that
has made the election described in the prior sentence may translate such accrued interest using the spot rate of
exchange on the date of receipt of the stated interest. The above election, if made, will apply to all other debt
instruments held by an electing U.S. holder and may not be changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognize
foreign currency exchange gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the Euro
payment received (determined based on the spot rate of exchange on the date such stated interest is received) in
respect of such accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of stated interest income that has accrued during such
accrual period (as determined above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at
such time. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute U.S. source ordinary
income or loss.

**_Foreign tax credit_**

Interest on a Note paid by the Dutch Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer generally will be foreign source
“passive category income” for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to U.S. holders under U.S.
federal income tax laws. Any non-U.S. withholding taxes paid at the rate applicable to a U.S. holder may be
eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at such holder’s election, deductions in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations and conditions. The calculation of foreign tax credits
involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder’s particular circumstances. U.S. holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility of any withholding taxes.

**_Sale or other taxable disposition of the Notes_**

A U.S. holder will recognize taxable gain or loss on the sale, taxable exchange, redemption, retirement, or other
taxable disposition of a Note. The amount of such gain or loss will generally equal the difference between the

337


-----

amount received for the Note in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to
accrued but unpaid interest which, if not previously included in income, will be taxable as interest income) and
the adjusted tax basis of the Note.

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be the U.S. holder’s cost of the Note. The cost of a
Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the
date of purchase, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar
value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase. The amount realized on a
sale, exchange, retirement, redemption, or other taxable disposition of Euro Notes for an amount in Euros
generally will be the U.S. dollar value of such amount on the settlement date, in the case of a cash basis U.S.
holder, or the trade date, in the case of an accrual basis U.S. holder, of such sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption, or other taxable disposition. On the settlement date, an accrual basis U.S. holder generally will
recognize U.S. source foreign currency gain or loss (as ordinary income or loss) equal to any difference between
the U.S. dollar value of the amount received based on the exchange rates in effect on the trade date and the
settlement date. However, in the case of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, accrual basis U.S.
holders may elect to determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realized on the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption, or other taxable disposition of the Euro Notes based on the exchange rate in effect on the settlement
date. Such an election by an accrual basis U.S. holder must be applied consistently from year to year to all debt
instruments held by the U.S. holder and cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note,
except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency exchange gain or loss, will generally constitute capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held such Note for more than one
year at the time of sale or other taxable disposition. Such gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S. source.
Long-term capital gains of non-corporate holders (including individuals) are generally eligible for reduced rates
of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to certain limitations.

Gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Euro
Note that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates generally will be U.S. source ordinary income
or loss and generally will not be treated as interest income. Gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in currency
exchange rates generally will equal the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s
foreign currency purchase price for the Euro Note, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S.
holder disposes of the Euro Note and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price for the Euro Note,
determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. holder purchased such Euro Note. In addition, upon
the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, a U.S. holder may
recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to amounts received with respect to accrued and unpaid stated
interest, which will be treated as discussed above under “—Interest denominated in Euro.” However, upon a sale,
exchange, redemption, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note, a U.S. holder will recognize any
foreign currency exchange gain or loss (including with respect to accrued interest) only to the extent of the total
gain or loss realized by such U.S. holder on such disposition.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for, and the tax consequences of,
payments made in a foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable
disposition of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable
disposition of a Note.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

U.S. holders may be subject, under certain circumstances, to information reporting and U.S. federal backup
withholding tax with respect to payments of interest and the gross proceeds from sales or dispositions (including
retirements or redemptions) of the Notes. Backup withholding applies only if the U.S. holder is not otherwise
exempt and such holder:

   - fails to furnish its taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social
security number;

   - furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;

   - has been notified by the IRS that it is subject to backup withholding because it did not report all of its
reportable interest or dividends on its tax returns; or

   - fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the taxpayer identification number provided is correct and
that the IRS has not notified the U.S. holder that it is subject to backup withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld from a payment to a U.S. holder under the
backup withholding rules is allowable as a credit against such U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and
may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that required information is timely furnished to the IRS. Certain
persons are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations.
U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for exemption from backup withholding
and the procedure to obtain such exemption.

We will furnish annually to the IRS, and to record holders of the Notes to whom we are required to furnish such
information, information relating to the amount of interest and the amount of tax withheld, if any, with respect to
payments on the Notes.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirements_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions
cover certain foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to
be reported to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a receipt of interest on a Euro Note or a sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Euro
Note to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition or receipt results in a tax
loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the
tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS
Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Certain information reporting requirements relating to foreign financial assets_**

U.S. holders that are individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate value in excess
of certain thresholds generally are required to file an information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such
assets with their tax returns. The Notes offered hereby generally may constitute specified foreign financial assets
subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account at certain financial institutions.
Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of these rules, in which case
it would be subject to the foregoing reporting rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the
effect, if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes. Penalties may apply for failure
to properly complete and file IRS Form 8938

**Non-U.S. holders**

The following discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a “non-U.S. holder,”
which means a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is an individual, an entity
taxable as a corporation, an estate or a trust that, in each case, is not a U.S. holder.

339


-----

**_Interest_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, payments of interest on a Note paid by the
Dutch Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer to any non-U.S. holder should generally not be subject to U.S. federal
income or U.S. federal withholding tax. Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below,
payments of interest on a Note paid by the U.S. Co-Issuer to any non-U.S. holder will generally not be subject to
U.S. federal income or U.S. federal withholding tax under the “portfolio interest” rule, provided that:

   - the non-U.S. holder does not directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the
capital or profits interests in the U.S. Co-Issuer;

   - the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to us through actual or constructive
stock ownership;

   - such payments are not effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or
business within the United States (or if an applicable income tax treaty applies, are not attributable to a
permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the non-U.S. holder); and

   - the applicable withholding agent receives:

       - from the non-U.S. holder, a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other
applicable documentation) executed under penalties of perjury, which provides the non-U.S.
holder’s name and address and certifies that the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. person; or

       - from a security clearing organization, bank, or other financial institution that holds the Notes in
the ordinary course of its trade or business (a “financial institution”) on behalf of the non-U.S.
holder, certification under penalties of perjury that such an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or
other applicable documentation) has been received by it, or by another such financial institution,
from the non-U.S. holder, and a copy of the IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other
applicable documentation) is furnished to the payor.

If a non-U.S. holder cannot satisfy the foregoing requirements, payments of interest made to such a
non-U.S. holder by the U.S. Co-Issuer generally will be subject to 30% U.S. federal withholding tax unless such
non-U.S. holder provides the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (i) IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax
under the benefit of a tax treaty between the United States and the non-U.S. holder’s country of residence, or
(ii) IRS Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on a Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a U.S. trade or business and is includible in
such holder’s gross income for the taxable year (as discussed below under “ —United States trade or business”).
It is possible that an applicable withholding agent may treat the entire amount of interest paid on a Note as U.S.
source interest subject to the withholding described above (in the absence of any applicable exemption), even if a
portion of such interest paid by the Dutch Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer may be treated as non-U.S. source
interest.

**_Sale or other taxable disposition of Notes_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, any gain realized by a non-U.S. holder on
the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will not be subject to
U.S. federal income tax, unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with the conduct by such non-U.S. holder of
a trade or business within the United States (or if an applicable income tax treaty applies, is attributable to a
permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by such holder) (in which case, such gain will be taxed as
described below) or (ii) the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or
more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied (in which case, any realized
gain (net of certain U.S. source losses) would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a 30% rate (or lower
applicable treaty rate)).

340


-----

**_United States trade or business_**

If interest or gain from a disposition of the Notes is effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a
U.S. trade or business (and if an applicable income tax treaty applies, the non-U.S. holder maintains a
U.S. permanent establishment or fixed base to which the interest or gain is attributable), the non-U.S. holder
generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the interest and gain on a net basis in the same manner as
if it were a U.S. holder. If interest received with respect to the Notes is taxable on a net basis, the 30% U.S.
federal withholding tax described above will not apply (assuming an appropriate certification is provided). In
addition, a foreign corporation that is a holder of a Note also may be subject to a branch profits tax equal to 30%
of its effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, subject to certain adjustments, unless it
qualifies for a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty. For this purpose, interest on a Note or gain
recognized on the disposition of a Note will be included in earnings and profits if the interest or gain is
effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign corporation of a trade or business in the United States.

Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors about any applicable income tax treaties, which may provide
for an exemption from or a lower rate of withholding tax, exemption from or reduction of branch profits tax or
other rules different from those described above.

**_Information reporting and backup withholding_**

In general, payments made by the U.S. Co-Issuer to a non-U.S. holder in respect of the Notes will be reported
annually to the IRS. Copies of these information returns also may be made available under the provisions of a
specific tax treaty or other agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides.

Treasury Regulations provide that the U.S. federal backup withholding tax and certain information reporting will
not apply to payments of interest with respect to which either (i) the requisite certification that a non-U.S. holder
is not a U.S. person, as described above, has been received or (ii) an exemption otherwise has been established,
in each case provided that the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge, or reason to know,
that the non-U.S. holder is a United States person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact,
satisfied.

The payment of the gross proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement, or other disposition of the
Notes to or through the U.S. office of any broker, U.S. or foreign, is generally subject to information reporting
and backup withholding unless a non-U.S. holder certifies as to its non-U.S. status under penalties of perjury or
otherwise establishes an exemption, provided that the broker does not have actual knowledge, or reason to know,
that the non-U.S. holder is a U.S. person or that the conditions of any other exemption are not, in fact, satisfied.
The payment of the gross proceeds from the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other disposition of the
Notes to or through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker will generally not be subject to information reporting
or backup withholding, except that information reporting (but generally not backup withholding) may apply if the
non-U.S. broker has certain types of relationships with the United States or if the broker is a U.S. person unless
the broker has documentary evidence in its files that the owner is a non-U.S. holder and the broker has no
knowledge, or reason to know, to the contrary, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be
refunded or credited against the non-U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that the requisite
information is timely provided to the IRS.

Non-U.S. holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding application of backup withholding in their
particular circumstances and the availability of and procedures for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding under current Treasury Regulations.

341


-----

**Additional withholding tax on payments made to foreign accounts**

Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred
to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or “FATCA”) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S.
financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on
payments of U.S. source interest on, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, a Note generating
U.S. source interest, paid to a “foreign financial institution” or a “non-financial foreign entity” (each as defined
in the Code), unless (i) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations,
(ii) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as
defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or
(iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from
these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements
in (i) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the Treasury requiring, among other
things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain “specified United States persons” or “United Statesowned foreign entities” (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain information about such accounts,
and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account
holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the
United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.

As discussed above under “ —Effect of co-issuance and source of interest,” we expect that interest paid by the
U.S. Co-Issuer will be considered U.S. source interest. Accordingly, under the applicable Treasury Regulations
and administrative guidance, withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of interest made by the
U.S. Co-Issuer and, on and after January 1, 2019, will apply to payments of the portion of gross proceeds from
the sale or other disposition of a Note that is attributable to the U.S. Co- Issuer. It is also possible that
withholding under FATCA may apply (or that an applicable withholding agent may treat withholding under
FATCA as applying) to payments of interest made by the Dutch Co-Issuer and the Swedish Co-Issuer and, on
and after January 1, 2019, may apply to payments of the portion of gross proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of a Note that is attributable to the Dutch Co-Issuer or the Swedish Co-Issuer. Prospective investors
should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA to their
investment in the Notes.

**Certain ERISA considerations**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition of the Notes by employee
benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to
Section 4975 of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations
that are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose
underlying assets are considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement (each, a
“Plan”).

**General fiduciary matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other
compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding
the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of
ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such purchase and holding will
not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement
of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase of Notes. In considering an
investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the
investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without
limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA,
the Code, and any other applicable Similar Laws.

**Prohibited transaction issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is
available. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other
things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between a
Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between a Plan and
a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest
or disqualified person, of any Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include the
Issuers, the initial purchasers, or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person who
engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities
under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/
or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which an issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor (the
“Transaction Parties”) is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct
or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the
investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited
transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or “PTCEs,” that
may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or

343


-----

holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company
pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life
insurance company general accounts, and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset
managers. In addition, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide relief from the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code for certain transactions, provided that
neither the issuer of the securities nor any of its affiliates (directly or indirectly) have or exercise any
discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan
involved in the transaction and provided further that the ERISA Plan pays no more than adequate consideration
in connection with the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions
will be satisfied.

Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans, and certain church plans, while not subject to the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may
affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering
an investment in the Notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable
fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief
under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any
person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase and holding will not constitute a non-exempt
prohibited transaction under ERISA and the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a Note, or any interest in a Note, each person who authorizes
such acquisition and holding and each subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted
that either (i) the purchaser or transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion
of the assets used to acquire or hold the Note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of any Plan or (ii) the
acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws.

If the purchaser or transferee of any Note or beneficial interest therein is an ERISA Plan, it will be required or
deemed to represent, warrant and agree that (i) none of the Transaction Parties, nor any of their affiliates, has
provided any investment recommendation or investment advice on which it, or any fiduciary or other person
investing the assets of the ERISA Plan (“Plan Fiduciary”), has relied in connection with its decision to invest in
Notes, and they are not otherwise acting as a fiduciary, as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA or
Section 4975(e)(3) of the Code, to the ERISA Plan or the Plan Fiduciary in connection with the ERISA Plan’s
acquisition of Notes; and (ii) the Plan Fiduciary is exercising its own independent judgment in evaluating the
transaction.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of
these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions,
it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the
Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential
applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an
exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction
rules of ERISA, the Code, or applicable Similar Laws. We make no representation as to whether an investment in
the Notes is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate for any particular plan
or arrangement.

compliance with any applicable state securities laws. You will notify any subsequent purchaser, and each
subsequent purchaser is required to notify any subsequent purchaser from it, of the resale restrictions set forth in
the preceding sentence.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the Resale

affiliates was the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes or 40 days (in the case of
Regulation S notes) after the later of the issue date of the Notes offered hereby and when the Notes or
any predecessor of the Notes are first offered to persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902
of Regulation S) in reliance on Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply after
the applicable Resale Restriction Period ends;

   - we and the trustee reserve the right to require in connection with any offer, sale or other transfer of
Notes under clauses (d) and (e) above the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications, and/or other
information satisfactory to us and the trustee; and

   - each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

**Plan of distribution**

The Issuers and Barclays Capital Inc., HSBC Bank plc and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC as the Dollar Notes
representatives (the “Dollar Notes Representatives”) of the Dollar Notes initial purchasers and Barclays Bank
PLC, HSBC Bank plc and J.P. Morgan Securities plc as the Euro Notes representatives (the “Euro Notes
Representatives” and together with the Dollar Notes Representatives, the “Representatives”) of the Euro Notes
initial purchasers, have entered into a purchase agreement with respect to the Notes.

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement, the initial purchasers are committed,
severally and not jointly, to take and pay for all of the Notes being offered, if any are taken. The initial offering
prices of the Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes are set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. After
the Notes are released for sale, the initial purchasers may change the offering prices and other selling terms. The
offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial
purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The initial purchasers may offer and sell the Notes
through certain of their affiliates or selling agents.

In the purchase agreement, the Issuers have agreed that:

   - the Issuers and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of any debt securities that are substantially similar to the Notes (other than the Notes) for a
period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum without the prior consent of the
Representatives; and

   - the Issuers and each of the Guarantor Subsidiaries will indemnify the several initial purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial
purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

The Issuers have agreed to cause the Guarantor Subsidiaries to accede to the purchase agreement by way of one
or more joinder agreements dated on or after the Closing Date.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. Each initial purchaser has agreed
that it will only offer or sell the Notes (A) in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act, and (B) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. Terms used above have the meanings given to them by Rule
144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes will, by its purchase, be deemed to
have made certain acknowledgments, representations, warranties, and agreements as set forth under “Transfer
_restrictions.”_

In addition, with respect to Notes initially sold pursuant to Regulation S, until 40 days after the later of the
commencement of this offering or the date the Notes are originally issued, an offer or sale of such Notes within
the United States by a dealer that is not participating in the offering may violate the registration requirements of
the Securities Act.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and
other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

One or more of the initial purchasers may not be U.S. registered broker-dealers. All sales of securities in the
United States will be made by or through U.S. registered broker-dealers.

The Notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. The Issuers have been advised by the
initial purchasers that the initial purchasers intend to make a market in the Notes but are not obligated to do so
and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of
the trading market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and

349


-----

liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their
applicable initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our
operating performance, and financial condition, general economic conditions, and other factors.

In connection with the offering, the initial purchasers may purchase and sell Notes in the open market. These
transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions, and purchases to cover positions created by short
sales. Short sales involve the sale by the initial purchasers of a greater number of Notes than they are required to
purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of
preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the Notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by the initial purchasers, as well as other purchases by the initial purchasers for their own
accounts, may stabilize, maintain, or otherwise affect the market price of the Notes. As a result, the price of the
Notes may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are
commenced, they may be discontinued by the initial purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected
in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. Neither the Issuers nor any of the initial purchasers make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above
may have on the price of the Notes.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about, 2018, which will be the
business day following the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement being referred to as
“T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two
business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish
to trade Notes prior to delivery of the Notes hereunder on the date hereof will be required, by virtue of the fact
that the Notes initially settle in T+, to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade
to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery
hereunder should consult their advisors.

Services Authority (“DFSA”). This document is intended for distribution only to persons of a type specified in
the Markets Rules 2012 of the DFSA. It must not be delivered to, or relied on by, any other person. The DFSA

-----

restrictions on their resale. Prospective purchasers of the securities offered should conduct their own due
diligence on the securities. If you do not understand the contents of this document you should consult an
authorized financial advisor.

In relation to its use in the DIFC, this document is strictly private and confidential and is being distributed to a
limited number of investors and must not be provided to any person other than the original recipient, and may not
be reproduced or used for any other purpose. The interests in the securities may not be offered or sold directly or
indirectly to the public in the DIFC.

**_European Economic Area_**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold, or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell, or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For the
purposes of this provision, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following
(i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
Insurance Mediation Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive.

Solely for the purposes of the manufacturers’ product approval process, the target market assessment in respect
of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending such debt securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target
market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or
otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended, the
“PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in
the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**_Hong Kong_**

Each initial purchaser (i) has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell in Hong Kong, by means of any
document, any Notes other than (a) to “professional investors” as defined in the Securities and Futures Ordinance
(Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) (the “SFO”) and any rules made under that Ordinance; or (b) in circumstances
which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” as defined in the Companies (Winding Up and
Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance (Cap. 32, Laws of Hong Kong) or which do not constitute an offer to the
public within the meaning of that Ordinance; and (ii) has not issued or had in its possession for the purposes of
issue, and will not issue or have in its possession for the purposes of issue, whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere,
any advertisement, invitation or document relating to the Notes, which is directed at, or the contents of which are
likely to be accessed or read by, the public of Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the securities laws
of Hong Kong) other than with respect to the Notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons
outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” as defined in the SFO and any rules made under that
Ordinance.

Each initial purchaser has represented and agreed that:

(a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”)) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of

(b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by

**_Other relationships_**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory,
investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities.
Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the
future perform, various financial advisory, investment banking commercial banking, and other commercial
services in the ordinary course of business for the Issuers and their affiliates, for which they received or will
receive customary fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

Certain of the initial purchasers or their affiliates will be lenders and/or agents under, and will receive fees in
connection with, the Issuers’ new senior secured credit facilities. HSBC Bank plc, Hongkong Shanghai Banking
Corporation Limited, and J.P. Morgan Securities plc have acted as financial advisors to the Seller in connection
with the Acquisition. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., together with certain of its affiliates or branches as it may
designate, will act as sole administrative agent with respect to the new senior secured credit facilities and will
perform the duties customarily associated with such role for a syndicate of banks, financial institutions and other
entities reasonably acceptable to the Issuers (excluding any disqualified lenders). Wilmington Trust (London)

agent with respect to the new senior secured credit and will perform the duties customarily associated with such
role. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, an initial purchaser of the Notes, will be the Paying Agent for the Euro
Notes, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, will be the
Registrar for the Euro Notes.

In addition, on April 17, 2018 the initial purchasers and/or certain of their affiliates entered into an amended and
restated commitment letter with us under which such persons committed to provide us with up to
€1,385.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured bridge loans under a senior unsecured credit
facility. Concurrently with the closing of this offering, such commitment shall be automatically terminated as a
result of the issuance of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers, and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers
(directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise). The initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in
respect of such securities or instruments and at any time may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire,
long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

355


-----

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with the Issuers, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may
hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuers consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically,
these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist
of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities of the Issuers,
including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely
affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. The initial purchasers and their affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities
or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in
such securities and instruments.

**2.** **NOTES TO THE CONDENSED COMBINED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE**
**HALF-YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2018**

**2.1 Introduction**

Akzo Nobel N.V. (together with its subsidiaries referred to as “AkzoNobel Group”) is a company
headquartered in the Netherlands. The registered office of Akzo Nobel N.V. is Christian Neefestraat 2 in
Amsterdam.

On March 9, 2017, AkzoNobel Group announced its plan to sharpen its strategic focus by separating into
two standalone companies; one focused on the Specialty Chemicals business and one focused on the Decorative
Paints and Performance Coatings business. On the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of November 30,
2017, the shareholders of Akzo Nobel N.V. approved the separation of its Specialty Chemicals business as part
of its strategy to create two focused, high performing businesses; Paints and Coatings and Specialty Chemicals.

In Q1 2018, the dual track process for the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group was successfully
completed with the signing of a sales agreement with the Carlyle Group and GIC. The sales process is, pending
authority approval and employee consultation, expected to be completed towards the end of 2018.

The accompanying Financial Statements of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group present the financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the half-year ended June 30, 2018 on a combined basis (the
“Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements”).

All amounts are in millions of euros unless otherwise stated.

**2.2 Basis of preparation**

The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34
“Interim Financial Reporting”. The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements are unaudited and do not
contain all the information and disclosures included in the annual Financial Statements and should be read in
conjunction with the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group Combined Carve-out Financial Statements for the
year ended December 31, 2017.

The Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements have been prepared for the purpose of presenting
the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group on a
stand-alone basis, as explained in the section on Basis of combination below, in a prospectus drawn up in relation
to the issue of bonds by the Carlyle Group and GIC on a non-public market.

The accounting policies adopted in the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s Condensed Combined
Interim Financial Statements are in accordance with the accounting policies as stated in the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group Combined Carve-out financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the
exception of the new IFRS accounting standards IFRS 9 and IFRS 15.

Income taxes are accounted for in line with IAS 34. The interim period is considered part of a larger
financial year, where the income tax is recognized in each interim period based on the best estimate of the
weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year. The estimated tax expenses are
determined based on a full year basis (P&L) and subsequently allocated using the expected full year effective tax
rate. The one-off items are recognized in full in the interim period in which they emerge. In the total interim tax
charge, no distinction is made between current and deferred tax expenses/income.

In the first half-year of 2018, the certain assets and liabilities that were already part of and belong to the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, have been legally transferred to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group if not already owned by a legal entity part of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. This was done

F-7


-----

by way of an asset transfer, demerger, contribution or indirectly through a transfer of shares in the legal entity in
which the relevant assets or liabilities resided. Conversely, legal entities forming part of the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals group have legally transferred certain assets and liabilities that are part of and belong to the
AkzoNobel Group, to subsidiaries of the AkzoNobel Group. Assets and liabilities have been transferred between
the AkzoNobel Group and the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group on an “as is” basis and on a going concern
basis. AkzoNobel Chemicals Holding B.V. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V..

The Separation was substantially completed in the first quarter of 2018 when Akzo Nobel Chemicals
Holding B.V. legally acquired all assets and liabilities of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, already
recognized in the Combined Financial Statements of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. Some of these
legal transfers were delayed in the United States, China, Germany, Pakistan and Brazil. The transfers in China
and Brazil were executed in the second quarter of 2018. It is envisaged that the remaining delayed legal transfers
will be completed prior to completion of the Specialty Chemicals transaction with Carlyle Group and GIC. The
total invoiced amounts of these legal transfers are recorded through equity as a shareholder’s transaction with the
AkzoNobel Group. As a result, the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements continue to be based
on predecessor values.

_New IFRS accounting standards_

IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments”, introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets
and liabilities. This standard encompasses an overall change of accounting principles for financial instruments
and replaces IAS 39 – the previous standard on financial instruments. The standard contains new requirements
for impairment of financial assets and for hedge accounting. The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has
adopted IFRS 9 as per January 1, 2018, and has not restated its 2017 comparative figures, consistent with the
allowed transitional option of IFRS 9. The transition effect on group equity as per January 1, 2018, is less than
€1 million after tax. The impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements is not significant.

IFRS 15, “Revenue from contracts with customers”, replaces previous revenue recognition guidance in
IFRS. It introduces a five-step model to determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount, based on
transfer of control over goods or services to the customer. The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has
adopted IFRS 15 as per January 1, 2018, and has not restated its 2017 comparative figures, consistent with the
allowed transitional option of IFRS 15. The transition effect on group equity as per January 1, 2018, is less than
€1 million after tax.

Furthermore, IFRS 16. “Leases”, is an important upcoming change, and will be implemented as of
January 1, 2019. Based on the results of our assessment so far with respect to IFRS 16, we expect total assets to
increase less than 10%. It should be noted that the actual impact will depend on the number, size and remaining
duration of lease contracts and any expected renewals at the moment of implementation as well as the discount
rates at January 1, 2019. We do not expect the impact on operating income to be significant.

_Basis of combination_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group combines the Business Area Specialty Chemicals as reported
by the AkzoNobel Group using the same accounting policies and consequential carrying (predecessor) values of
assets and liabilities and revenue recognition policies as identified in the AkzoNobel Group with certain other
assets and liabilities and income and expense which are directly attributed to the Specialty Chemicals business
from the Business Area Corporate and Other. During the periods presented, the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group functioned as part of the larger group of companies controlled by Akzo Nobel N.V. and accordingly,
AkzoNobel Group performed certain corporate overhead services for the Specialty Chemicals business. These
services include, but are not limited to, executive oversight, information management, legal, treasury, pensions,
control and accounting, human resources, taxes and investor relations.

_Limitations inherent to carve-out_

Management believes the allocation methods applied in the Condensed Combined Interim Financial
Statements to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided by AkzoNobel Group and the
historical cost of doing business. However, as the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not operate as a
stand-alone entity in the past, these Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements may not be indicative of
the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group‘s future performance and do not necessarily reflect what its
combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been, had the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group operated as a separate entity from AkzoNobel Group for the periods presented.

_Use of estimates_

The preparation of the Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements requires management to make
judgments, estimates, and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from the estimates. In preparing the
Condensed Combined Interim Financial Statements, the significant estimates and judgments made by
management in applying the accounting policies and the sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
applied to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group Combined Carve-out Financial Statements for the year
ended December 31, 2017.

As used herein, the term “AkzoNobel” is used for Akzo Nobel N.V. and its group companies excluding the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

**2.3 Legal separation from AkzoNobel Group**

As referred to in paragraph 2.2 (Basis of Preparation) the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group combines
the Business Area Specialty Chemicals as reported by the AkzoNobel Group with certain other assets and
liabilities and income and expense which are directly attributed to the Specialty Chemicals business from the
Business Area Corporate and Other.

The final legal restructuring is expected to be consistent with the economic perimeter of the Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements in all material respects.

In connection with the legal separation, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. entered
into a Master Separation Agreement and a set of ancillary agreements, which together provide a contractual
framework for the relationship between AkzoNobel Group and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. after the
separation. The matters agreed in the Share Purchase Agreement between Akzo Nobel N.V., The Carlyle Group
and GIC are substantially the same as in the Master Separation Agreement.

In connection with this Master Separation Agreement, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals
Holding B.V. entered into a number of transitional service level agreements based on which AkzoNobel Group
provides the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group with certain services such as, amongst others, IT, real estate
and HR. Next to the transitional service level agreements, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding
B.V. have entered into a brand license agreement for the usage of the AkzoNobel brand and brand name.

Refer to note 2.14 for an overview of the related party transactions.

**2.4 Seasonality**

Within the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, some businesses experience limited seasonal influences.
Revenue and profitability are affected by developments in the agricultural and building and construction season
and tend to be slightly higher in the first half of the year.

**2.6 Operating income**

Operating income of the first half-year was at €294 million (2017: €326 million). Positive impacts from
stronger price/mix effects and productivity improvement were more than offset by adverse currencies and
separation related costs.

**2.7 Financing income and expenses**

Financing income and expenses increased in the first half-year of 2018 to €17 million (expenses) (2017:
€9 million expenses).

_Invested capital_

As per June 30, 2018 Invested capital amounts to €3,686 million (December 31, 2017: €3,537 million).

**2.11 Business equity**

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operated and was managed as part of the AkzoNobel Group
during the periods presented. The Business equity consists of the owner’s net investment and the Non-controlling
interests. The owner’s net investment reflects the net funding position between the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group and AkzoNobeI. The owner’s net investment comprises currency translation differences,
hedging reserve, reserve relating to share-based compensation, result for the period and owner’s funding.

_Transfer settlements_

Business equity was reduced by the transaction value of these separation transactions in the first half-year of
2018. These transactions were not settled in cash in the first half-year of 2018 leading to an increased receivable
from AkzoNobel Group (€335 million) and an increased payable to AkzoNobel Group (€1,356 million) as per
June 30, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, all positions to and from AkzoNobel
Group were considered to be part of owner’s net investment. The outstanding balance due to the AkzoNobel
Group created from the separation transactions, will be settled in conjunction with the proceeds from the sale
transaction.

_Funding by owner_

The contribution from (distribution to) the owner in the combined statement of changes in business equity
deviates from the funding from (to) the owner in the combined statement of cash flows due to income taxes paid
by the owner on behalf of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

**2.12 Cash flow**

_Operational cash flow_

Net cash from operating activities increased from €206 million in the first half-year of 2017 to €239 million
in the first half-year of 2018.

_Capital expenditures_

For the first half-year of 2018 the capital expenditures amounted to €161 million, in comparison with
€164 million in the same period previous year.

**2.13 Financial risk management**

The financial risk management objectives and policies of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group are
consistent with those disclosed in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements for the year ended
December 31, 2017. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables less allowance for
impairment, short-term borrowings and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity
period of those instruments.

**2.14 Related party transactions**

We consider AkzoNobel (including its key management personnel), key management personnel, pension
funds in which the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group participates, as well as the joint ventures of the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group to be related parties.

We purchased and sold goods and services to various related parties in which we hold a 50 percent or less
equity interest (joint ventures). Such transactions were conducted at arm’s length with terms comparable with
transactions with third parties.

During the periods presented, we considered the CEO and CFO of Business Area Specialty Chemicals to be
the key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 “Related parties”. No loans, advance payments or
guarantees have been extended to key management personnel, or any close family member of such persons.

Effective as of January 1, 2018, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. entered into a
Master Separation Agreement and a set of ancillary and service level agreements, together effectuating the
internal separation and providing a framework for the relationship between AkzoNobel and the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals group going forward. Based on these transitional service level agreements (TSLAs),
effective as of January 1, 2018, AkzoNobel Group provides the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group with
certain services such as, amongst others, Human resources, Information Management, Finance, Research
Development and Innovation and Real Estate. The duration of the TSLAs ranges from 3 months to a maximum
of 12 to 24 months. Next to the transitional service level agreements, Akzo Nobel N.V and Akzo Nobel
Chemicals Holding B.V. have entered into a brand license agreement for the usage of the AkzoNobel brand and

**2.** **NOTES TO THE COMBINED CARVE-OUT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE AKZONOBEL**
**SPECIALTY CHEMICALS GROUP**

**1** **Description of the business**

Akzo Nobel N.V. (together with its subsidiaries referred to as “AkzoNobel Group”) is a company
headquartered in the Netherlands. The registered office of Akzo Nobel N.V. is Christian Neefestraat 2 in
Amsterdam.

AkzoNobel Group was organized in three operational Business Areas, being Decorative Paints, Performance
Coatings and Specialty Chemicals, and one non-operational Business Area (“Corporate and Other”).

On 9 March 2017, AkzoNobel Group announced its plan to sharpen its strategic focus by separating into
two standalone companies; one focused on the Specialty Chemicals business and one focused on the Decorative
Paints and Performance Coatings business.

On the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) of 30 November 2017, the shareholders of Akzo Nobel N.V.
approved the separation of its Specialty Chemicals business as part of its strategy to create two focused, high
performing businesses; Paints and Coatings and Specialty Chemicals.

This shareholder approval enabled AkzoNobel to separate its Specialty Chemicals business and divest it. On
27 March 2018, AkzoNobel announced that it had come to an agreement to sell 100% of its Specialty Chemicals
business to The Carlyle Group and GIC. A Share Purchase Agreement was signed on 27 March 2018. The
transaction is expected to be completed in 2018.

The Specialty Chemicals Business Area (“Specialty Chemicals”) of AkzoNobel Group and the activities of
Corporate and Other that have specifically been attributed to Specialty Chemicals, historically did not exist as a
separate legal and reporting group. This combination of economic activities are referred to as “AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group” in these Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.

AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group is a major producer of specialty chemicals in markets such as
surfactants, polymer chemistry, pulp processing and chlor-alkali and is currently organized into five business
units (BUs):

   - Industrial Chemicals;

   - Surface Chemistry;

   - Pulp and Performance Chemicals;

   - Polymer Chemistry and;

   - Ethylene and Sulfur Derivatives.

Brands include AkzoNobel[®], Biostyle[®], Dissolvine[®], Ecosel[®], Eka[®], Expancel[®], Jozo[®], Kromasil[®] and
Levasil[®].

For the purpose of the evaluation of the historical financial performance of the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group and the preparation for the separation, AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2015, 2016 and 2017, have been prepared.

During 2017, AkzoNobel Group started the planning for the internal restructuring of the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group. This restructuring required the legal and economic transfer of local assets, shares
and employees allocated to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. This legal restructuring step was
substantially completed in the first quarter of 2018 when Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. acquired all assets
and liabilities of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, with the exception of certain delayed transfers in
the United States, Germany, Pakistan, Colombia, and Brazil. The transfer in Brazil was executed in the second

F-18


-----

quarter of 2018. It is envisaged that the remaining delayed transfers will be completed prior to completion of the
Specialty Chemicals transaction with Carlyle Group and GIC. Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. is a whollyowned subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V.

The final legal restructuring is expected to be consistent with the economic perimeter of the Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements in all material respects.

In connection with the legal separation, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. entered
into a Master Separation Agreement and a set of ancillary agreements, which together provide a contractual
framework for the relationship between AkzoNobel Group and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. after the
separation. The matters agreed in the Share Purchase Agreement between Akzo Nobel N.V., The Carlyle Group
and GIC are substantially the same as in the Master Separation Agreement.

As used herein, the term “AkzoNobel” is used for Akzo Nobel N.V. and its group companies excluding the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

**2** **Basis of preparation**

_IFRS compliance_

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2015, 2016 and 2017,
have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (“IFRS”) on a combined basis (“Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements”) and have been
derived from the consolidated financial statements of Akzo Nobel N.V. for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017, which
have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The accounting policies in the historical Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group are consistent with the accounting policies applied in AkzoNobel Group’s
consolidated financial statements, which comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. All IFRSs which
application was mandatory in the European Union companies for the fiscal year 2017 have been consistently
applied for each of the years 2015 through 2017. IFRS provides no guidance for the preparation of combined
carve-out financial statements, which are therefore subject to IAS 8.12. This paragraph requires consideration of
the most recent pronouncements of other standard-setting bodies, other financial reporting requirements and
recognized industry practices.

In the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, the
predecessor accounting approach has been applied in accordance with the common practice on the accounting for
business combinations under common control in combined financial statements. This means that the assets,
liabilities, income and expenses of the economic activities included in the Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements correspond to the historically reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements of
AkzoNobel N.V. (predecessor values).

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention,
unless otherwise indicated. The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is presented in Note 24.

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been authorized for issue on 27 August 2018 by the
Board of Management of AkzoNobel Group.

_Scope of combination_

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements have been prepared for the purpose of presenting the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group on a stand
F-19


-----

alone basis, as explained in the section on Basis of combination below, in a prospectus drawn up in relation to the
issue of bonds by the Carlyle Group and GIC on a non-public market.

_Limitations inherent to carve-out_

As the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not operate as a stand-alone entity in the past, these
Combined Carve-out Financial Statements may not be indicative of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s
future performance and what its combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have
been, had the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operated as a separate entity from AkzoNobel Group for
the periods presented. Rather than the legal structure, the economic activities under common management and
the perimeter agreed between the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel in the separation
process have been considered the main factors in determining the perimeter of the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.

_Basis of combination_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group combines the Business Area Specialty Chemicals as reported by
the AkzoNobel Group with certain other assets and liabilities and income and expense which are directly attributed
to the Specialty Chemicals business from the Business Area Corporate and Other. During the periods presented, the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group functioned as part of the larger group of companies controlled by Akzo
Nobel N.V. and accordingly, AkzoNobel Group performed certain corporate overhead services for the Specialty
Chemicals business. These services include, but are not limited to, executive oversight, information management,
legal, treasury, pensions, control and accounting, human resources, taxes and investor relations.

Prior to 1 January 2018, the Specialty Chemicals business was conducted through 118 dedicated legal
entities, combined with 36 shared legal entities, containing both Specialty Chemicals and other AkzoNobel
Group corporate and operational activities which have been partly attributed to the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group.

Intragroup transactions, balances and unrealized gains and losses on transactions within the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group have been eliminated. Transactions between AkzoNobel and the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group are recognized in accordance with IFRS and classified as related party transactions.
The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements reflect all material transactions between the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel. For details of such transactions with AkzoNobel, refer to Note 22 –
Related party transactions.

_Material subsidiaries_

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements comprise the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of 118
dedicated AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group legal entities. We consider legal entities material when they
represent, for at least two subsequent years, more than 5 percent of either revenue or operating income (before
Identified items). Material subsidiaries included in the table below are 100 percent owned and meet these criteria.

_Combined Statements of Income_

The Combined Statement of Income of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group reflect income and
expenses of the Business Area Specialty Chemicals combined with certain income and expenses of Corporate
and Other directly attributed to Specialty Chemicals business.

AkzoNobel Group corporate overhead services related to the Specialty Chemicals business are included in
the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements based on specific identification and activity levels or have been
allocated based on allocation keys, if no specific activity levels were available. Assumptions and estimates made
with regard to the allocation of expenses were consistently applied in each reporting period.

Where not specifically identifiable, expenses of Corporate and Other have been allocated to the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group using the following allocation methods:

   - Employee benefit expenses have been allocated to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group based on
activity levels and related FTE allocation between the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and
AkzoNobel. This allocation was determined on a function by function, entity by entity basis using best
estimates of historical activity levels to support the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and
AkzoNobel, as set out in further detail below.

   - Other operational expenses, such as rental costs, facility management, external advisors and service
providers have been allocated to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group using allocation keys such
as revenue, square meters or other allocation keys that were deemed an appropriate approximation of
activity levels.

   - Depreciation and amortization were assigned to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group following
the allocation of underlying assets.

_Combined Balance Sheets_

The combined assets and liabilities of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group include the assets and
liabilities previously reported as part of Specialty Chemicals (except for income tax balances) combined with
assets and liabilities of Corporate and Other that have directly been attributed to the Specialty Chemicals
business. Where required, allocations and attributions have been made as follows:

   - Post-retirement provisions were allocated between the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and
AkzoNobel based on headcount for obligations in relation to active employees and post-separation
retention of liabilities and obligations to finance the post-retirement plans for inactive employees, as set
out in further detail below.

   - Environmental and sundry provisions have been specifically attributed to the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group if related to the historical Specialty Chemicals sites and activities and intended postseparation retention of the related liability.

   - Restructuring provisions were allocated between the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and
AkzoNobel based on the split of employees (FTEs).

   - Other payables, excluding employee benefit expenses, were allocated based on their relative share of the
expenses allocation.

   - Property, plant and equipment have been attributed based on usage and intended post-separation
ownership.

Management believes the allocation methods applied in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements to be
a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided by AkzoNobel Group and the historical cost of
doing business.

_Combined Statements of Cash Flows_

The Combined Statements of Cash Flows of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group have been prepared
using the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature,
any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense
associated with investing or financing cash flows. Cash deposits of the AkzoNobel Group are pooled and
transferred to a central treasury function on a daily basis wherever possible. Amounts for cash, cash equivalents
and debt are reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements only for those activities of the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group that operated or existed in separate dedicated AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group legal entities, during the periods presented in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.
For all other activities, cash flows generated form part of contribution from (distribution to) owner reflected in
Business equity.

_Income tax_

AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group legal entities file a (consolidated) tax return on a standalone basis
or, for the majority of its jurisdictions, either with other AkzoNobel entities through a fiscal unity or because the
reporting entity forms part of a larger AkzoNobel legal entity. For the purpose of the Combined Carve-Out
Financial Statements, income taxes are computed and reported on a combination of the so-called separate return
method for the Combined Statement of Income and the legal entity approach for the Combined Balance Sheet.
Under the separate return method, the carve-out entity calculates its tax provision as if it was filing its own
separate tax return based on the pre-tax accounts included in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.

Under the separate return method careful consideration is required in relation to Net Operating Losses
(“NOL’s”) (and other tax attributes) to ensure that these will be available to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group post separation. Considering that the deferred tax assets for NOL’s and tax credits are not available to the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group if they are not contained in a surviving AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group legal entity, these deferred tax assets are not included in the Combined Balance Sheet of the Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements. Instead they are treated as contributions from (distributions to) owner (i.e.
settled through equity) in accordance with the legal entity approach that is used for tax positions on the
Combined Balance Sheet.

AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group management determines the income tax positions and expense for
each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. This involves the allocation of the actual current tax exposures
and provisions as well as assessing temporary and permanent differences.

AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group management considers the separate tax return method to be
appropriate, but due to the use of certain assumptions and allocation keys (in most cases and to the extent
possible in accordance with the commercial allocation) it may not necessarily lead to the income tax positions
and expense that would have been incurred if the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group entities were actually
separate taxable entities.

In certain jurisdictions, AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operations were part of a larger AkzoNobel
Group tax return. In general, income tax associated with these tax groups was paid by the head of the
consolidated tax group and reported in the consolidated financial statements of AkzoNobel Group. Accordingly,
income tax associated with these tax groups was reported in the consolidated financial statements of AkzoNobel
Group and paid by AkzoNobel. In line with the legal entity approach, the effects of being included in the
AkzoNobel consolidated tax returns, including the utilization of any historical net operating losses, have been
recorded as part of owner’s net investment in Business equity. The Combined Statement of Cash Flows present
taxes actually paid by tax groups that are part of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group or dedicated
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group legal entities. Tax payments made by non- AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group legal entities have not been included.

F-22


-----

Uncertain tax positions have been included in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements based on a
combination of the separate return method for the Combined Statement of Income and the legal entity approach
for the Combined Balance Sheet. Under the separate return method the uncertain tax positions have been reported
in the Combined Statement of Income in the event they originate from the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group business and under the legal entity approach the uncertain tax positions have been reported on the
Combined Balance Sheet in the event they reflect potential liabilities that would (primarily) arise to surviving
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group legal entities. The change in methodology over the years is reflected in
the Funding by owner line in the Business equity.

_Goodwill allocation_

The goodwill included in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements is based on the goodwill
attributable to the companies or businesses within the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. During the
reporting periods presented, goodwill was tested for impairment at the business unit level, being a group of cashgenerating units used at that time by the AkzoNobel Group to monitor goodwill.

The business unit level was determined to also be the appropriate level for testing of goodwill for
impairment for the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

_Business equity_

The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements do not show subscribed share capital or additional paid-in
capital, as the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not have an ultimate holding legal entity heading the
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

_Owner’s net investment and funding structure_

The AkzoNobel Group utilizes a central approach for cash management and the funding of its operations.
Therefore, all balances with AkzoNobel (in-house bank, cash pool, and intercompany loans) have been presented
as owner’s net investment in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, except for intercompany current
accounts with AkzoNobel that have an operational nature and are settled periodically based on instructions from
AkzoNobel Group treasury.

The funding structure is therefore not necessarily representative of the financing that would have been
reported, had the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operated on its own or as an entity independent from
AkzoNobel during the periods presented, nor is it indicative of the financing structure in the future. During the
reporting periods included in these Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group was mainly financed by AkzoNobel Group. The capital structure of the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group at the time of the separation will likely differ from the capital structure presented in the
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements.

_Post-retirement benefits_

AkzoNobel Group is sponsor of defined benefit plans (DB) that are partly externally funded and, mainly for
Germany, partially unfunded. Liabilities, assets and costs of plans that are entirely AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group‘s are attributed to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. To the extent plans relate to
active employees and whose participants are partially allocated to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group
and partially to AkzoNobel, the individual employee liabilities and costs were used for the attribution. The
individual liabilities for active employees are based on a split of FTEs between AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group and AkzoNobel for 2015, 2016 and 2017. To the extent plans relate to inactive employees, the allocation
between AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel was determined based on the intended postseparation retention of the liabilities. The main defined benefit plans are located in Germany, US, Switzerland,

F-23


-----

Sweden and Belgium. For some small and immaterial plans, the allocation between AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel is based on the allocation of headcount. The liabilities have been determined
under the guidance of IAS 19 and calculated by independent actuaries. The allocation of plan assets follows the
allocation of defined benefit obligations on a pro-rata basis.

_Use of the AkzoNobel brand name_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group uses the AkzoNobel[®] brand name and historically was charged
a royalty cost determined as a percentage of revenue. The Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements include
these royalty cost charges to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group for the AkzoNobel[®] brand name, as
detailed in Note 22.

_Share-based compensation_

Certain employees are entitled to a performance-related share or share-matching plan under which Akzo
Nobel N.V. shares are conditionally granted to these employees. The related share-based compensation expenses
have been allocated to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group based on an estimate of the activity levels of
those employees of Specialty Chemicals and Corporate and Other entitled to share-based compensation.

All employees eligible to share-based compensation within AkzoNobel Group have been allocated to either
AkzoNobel or the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group based on the separation decisions made in 2017 up to
the date these Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements were authorized for issuance. Based upon this
allocation IFRS 2 disclosures have been prepared.

_Subsequent events_

The AkzoNobel Group consolidated financial statements, from which these Combined Carve-Out Financial
Statements were derived, were authorized for issue on 7 March 2018. Subsequent events have been considered
from 31 December 2017 up to the date these Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements were authorized for
issuance.

_Earnings per share_

The information on earnings per share for the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group pursuant to IAS 33
has not been presented, as the combined entities have not formed a separate legal and statutory group and, as
such, the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has no historical capital structure and therefore no subscribed
share capital.

**3** **Accounting policies**

_Change in accounting policies_

Accounting pronouncements, which became effective for 2017, such as amendments to IAS 7 ‘Cash flow
statement’, IAS 12 ‘Income tax’ as well as IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’, had no material
impact on our Combined Carve-out Financial Statements.

_Use of estimates_

The preparation of financial statements in compliance with IFRS requires management to make judgments,
estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The estimates and
assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances and are used to judge the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from

F-24


-----

other sources. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. The most critical
accounting policies involving a higher degree of judgment and complexity in applying principles of valuation
and for which changes in the assumptions and estimates could result in significantly different results than those
recorded in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements are the following:

   - Basis of preparation (Note 2);

   - Income tax (Note 8);

   - Impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment (Note 9 and 10);

   - Post-retirement benefits (Note 6 and 16) and;

   - Provisions (Note 16 and 17).

_Joint Operations_

A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have
rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when
decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In the Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements the following in relation to AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Groups interest in a
joint operation is recognized:

   - Our assets, including our share of any assets held jointly;

   - Our liabilities, including our share of any liabilities incurred jointly;

   - Our revenue from the sale of our share of the output arising from the joint operation;

   - Our share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and

   - Our expenses, including our share of any expenses incurred jointly.

Assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Groups interest in a
joint operation are recognized in accordance with our accounting principles to the particular assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses.

_Foreign currencies_

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign currency
exchange rate at transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated
into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Resulting foreign currency
differences are included in the Combined Statement of Income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at acquisition date.

The assets and liabilities of entities with other than euro functional currencies are translated into euros, the
reporting currency of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group, using the exchange rates at the balance sheet
date. The income and expenses of entities with other functional currencies are translated into the functional
currency, using the exchange rates at transaction date.

Foreign exchange differences resulting from translation into the functional currency of investments in
subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component (cumulative translation reserves) within Other comprehensive
income. These cumulative translation adjustments are reclassified (either fully or partly) to the Combined
Statement of Income upon disposal (either fully or partly) or liquidation of the foreign subsidiary to which the
investment or the intercompany loan with a permanent nature relates to.

F-25


-----

Foreign currency differences arising on the re-translation of a financial liability designated as an effective
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are recognized in the cumulative translation reserves (in Other
comprehensive income).

_Exchange rates of key currencies_

The principal exchange rates against the euro used in preparing the Combined Balance Sheet and the
Combined Statement of Income are:

_Revenue recognition_

Revenue is defined as the revenue from the sale and delivery of goods and services, net of rebates, discounts
and similar allowance and net of sales tax. Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards have
been transferred to a third party, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible
return of goods can be estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods.

For revenue from sales of goods these conditions are generally met at the time the product is shipped and
delivered to the customer, depending on the delivery conditions. Service revenue is generally recognized as
services are rendered.

_Post-retirement benefits (Note 6, 16)_

Contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the Combined Statement of Income as
incurred.

Many of our defined benefit pension plans are funded with plan assets that have been segregated in a trust or
foundation. We also provide post-retirement benefits other than pensions to certain employees, which are
generally not funded. Valuations of both funded and unfunded plans are carried out by independent actuaries
based on the projected unit credit method. Post-retirement costs primarily represent the increase in the actuarial
present value of the obligation for projected benefits based on employee service during the year and net interest
on the net defined benefit liability/asset. When the valuation results in a benefit to the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form
of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. An economic benefit is
available if it is realizable during the life of the plan, or on the settlement of the plan liabilities. The non-interest
effect of these so-called asset ceiling restrictions and any changes therein is recognized in Other comprehensive
income. Remeasurement gains and losses, which arise in calculating our obligations, are recognized in Other
comprehensive income. When the benefits of a plan improve, the portion of the increased benefits related to past
service by employees is recognized as an expense in the Combined Statement of Income immediately. We
recognize gains and losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan in the Combined Statement
of Income when the curtailment or settlement occurs.

Net interest on the net defined benefit liability is included in financing expenses related to post-retirement
benefits under Financing income and expenses. Other charges and benefits recognized are reported in operating
income, unless recorded in Other comprehensive income.

F-26


-----

_Other employee benefits (Note 6, 17)_

Provisions for other long-term employee benefits are measured at present value, using actuarial assumptions
and methods. Any actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Combined Statement of Income in the period
in which they arise.

_Share-based compensation (Note 6)_

We have a performance-related share plan and a share-matching plan, under which shares are conditionally
granted to certain employees. The fair value is measured at grant date and amortized over the three-year period
during which the employees normally become unconditionally entitled to the shares with a corresponding
increase in Business equity. Amortization is accelerated in the event of earlier vesting.

_Income tax (Note 8)_

Income tax expense comprises both current and deferred tax, including effects of changes in tax rates. In
determining the amount of current and deferred tax we also take into account the impact of uncertain tax
positions and whether additional taxes and interest may be due. Income tax is recognized in the Combined
Statement of Income, unless it relates to items recognized in Other comprehensive income or Business equity.
Current tax includes the expected tax payable and receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at reporting date, as well as (any adjustments to) tax payable and receivable with
respect to previous years.

Deferred tax is recognized using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. We do not
recognize deferred tax for the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences related to investments in subsidiaries to the extent
that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax
losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available against which they can be utilized.

Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based upon the enacted or substantively enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be
reversed. Non-refundable dividend tax is taken into account in the determination of deferred tax liabilities to the
extent of earnings expected to be distributed by subsidiaries in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax positions are
not discounted.

_Government grants_

Government grants related to costs are deducted from the relevant costs to be compensated in the same
period. Government grants to compensate for the cost of an asset are deducted from the cost of the related asset.
Emission rights granted by the government are recorded at cost. A provision is recorded if the actual emission is
higher than the emission rights granted.

_Intangible assets (Note 9)_

Intangible assets are valued at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment charges. Intangible assets
with an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not amortized, but tested for impairment annually. Goodwill
in a business combination represents the excess of the consideration paid over the net fair value of the acquired
identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the cost of an acquisition is less than the fair value of
the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the Combined Statement of
Income. The effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests are recorded in Business equity if there is no
change in control.

F-27


-----

Intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as licenses, know-how, brands, customer relationships,
intellectual property rights, emission rights and capitalized development, are capitalized at historical cost and
amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets, which generally ranges from five to
40 years for brands with finite useful lives, five to 25 years for customer lists and three to 15 years for other
intangibles. Amortization methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.

_Property, plant and equipment (Note 10)_

Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Costs include expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset, including borrowing cost
of capital investment projects under construction.

Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, based on the estimated useful life of the asset
components. The useful life of plant equipment and machinery generally ranges from ten to 25 years and for
buildings ranges from 20 to 50 years. Land is not depreciated. In the majority of cases residual value is assumed
to be insignificant. Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually.

Costs of major maintenance activities are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life.
Maintenance costs which cannot be separately defined as a component of property, plant and equipment are
expensed in the period in which they occur.

We recognize conditional asset retirement obligations in the periods in which sufficient information
becomes available to reasonably estimate the cash outflow.

_Impairments (Note 9, 10)_

We assess the carrying value of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.

In addition, for goodwill, the carrying value is at least reviewed annually in the fourth quarter. If the
carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount, an impairment
loss is recognized in the Combined Statement of Income. The assessment for impairment is performed at the
lowest level of assets generating largely independent cash inflows. For goodwill, we have determined this to be at
business unit level.

Except for goodwill, we reverse impairment losses in the Combined Statement of Income if and to the
extent we have identified a change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

_Leases (Note 10, 18, 21)_

Lease contracts in which we have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as
financial leases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at the lower of its fair value and the
present value of minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is depreciated using a
straight-line method, based on the lower of the estimated useful life or the lease term. The interest expenses are
recognized as other financing expenses over the lease term.

Payments made under operational leases are recognized in the Combined Statement of Income on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.

_Joint ventures (Note 11)_

Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Combined
Carve-Out Financial Statements include our share of the income and expenses of the joint ventures, whereby the

F-28


-----

result is determined using our accounting principles. When the share of losses exceeds the interest in the
investee, the carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued, unless we have
incurred legal or constructive obligations on behalf of the investee. Loans to joint ventures are carried at
amortized cost less any impairment losses.

_Inventories (Note 13)_

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs of inventories comprise all
costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location
and condition. The costs of inventories are determined using weighted average cost.

_Provisions (Note 17)_

We recognize provisions when a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists, it
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits is required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at net present value.

The increase of provisions as a result of the passage of time is recognized in the Combined Statement of
Income under Financing income and expenses.

Provisions for restructuring are recognized when a detailed and formal restructuring plan has been approved
and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. We do not provide for future
operating costs.

A provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold, generally based
on historical warranty data.

_Financial instruments_

Regular purchases and sales of financial assets and liabilities are recognized on trade date. The initial
measurement of all financial instruments is at fair value. Except for derivatives, the initial measurement of
financial instruments is adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs.

_Derivative financial instruments (Note 24)_

Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value on the Combined Balance Sheet. Fair values are
derived from market prices and quotes from dealers and brokers, or are estimated using observable market inputs.
When determining fair values, credit risk for our contract party, as well as for AkzoNobel Group, is taken into
account.

Changes in the fair value are recognized in the Combined Statement of Income, unless cash flow hedge
accounting or net investment hedge accounting is applied. In those cases, the effective part of the fair value
changes is deferred in Other comprehensive income and released to the related specific lines in the Combined
Statement of Income or Combined Balance Sheet at the same time as the hedged item.

_Other financial non-current assets (Note 12) and Receivables (Note 14)_

Loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any
impairment losses. An allowance for impairment is established if the collection of a receivable becomes doubtful.

_Cash and cash equivalents (Note 18)_

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value and include all cash balances and short-term
investments that are directly convertible into cash. Changes in fair values are included in Financing income and
expenses.

F-29


-----

_Long-term and short-term borrowings (Note 18, 24) and Payables (Note 19)_

Long-term and short-term borrowings, as well as Trade and other payables, are measured at amortized cost,
using the effective interest rate method. The interest expense on borrowings is included in Finance income and
expenses. The fair value of borrowings, used for disclosure purposes, is determined on the basis of listed market
prices, if available. If a listed market price is not available, the fair value is calculated based on the present value
of principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the interest at the reporting date, taking into account
AkzoNobel Group’s credit risk.

_New IFRS accounting standards_

IFRS standards and interpretations thereof not yet in force which may apply to our Financial Statements for
2018 and beyond have been assessed for their potential impact. The most important upcoming changes relate to
IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” which will be adopted
as per 1 January 2018. Another important upcoming chance relates to IFRS 16 “Leases” which will be
implemented as per 1 January 2019.

**New IFRS accounting standards**

**Implementation**
**date of the** **Adopted by the**

**Standard** **Published** **standard** **European Union** **Anticipated impact**

IFRS 9, “Financial 2009-2014 1 January 2018 22 November 2016 More details on the impact are
Instruments” provided below.


IFRS 15, “Revenue
from Contracts
with Customers”


28 May 2014 1 January 2018 22 September 2016 More details on the impact are
provided below.


IFRS 16, “Leases” 13 January 2016 1 January 2019 31 October 2017 IFRS 16 replaces existing
guidance on lessee accounting
for leases. It requires lessees to
bring most leases on balance
sheet in a single lease
accounting model, recognizing a
right-of-use asset and a lease
liability. Based on the results of
our assessment so far, we expect
total assets to increase not more
than 10 percent. It should be
noted that the actual impact will
depend on the number, size and
remaining duration of lease
contracts and any expected
renewals at the moment of
implementation. We do not
expect the impact on operating
income to be significant.

_IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments”_

IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and liabilities. This
standard encompasses an overall change of accounting principles for financial instruments and replaces IAS 39 –
the current standard on financial instruments. The standard contains new requirements for impairment of
financial assets and for hedge accounting. The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has decided to implement

F-30


-----

and adopt IFRS 9 as from 1 January 2018, when it becomes effective. In 2017, we completed the assessment of
the impact of the standard, which is set out further below.

_Transition method_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group will adopt IFRS 9 as of 1 January 2018 and will not restate the
2017 comparative figures. The transition effect on equity as per 1 January 2018 is less than €1 million.

_Classification and measurement_

The impact on the classification and measurement of financial assets is not significant.

The vast majority of other financial non-current assets as well as trade and other receivables were measured
at amortized cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

In accordance with IFRS 9, these other financial non-current assets and trade and other receivables will
continue to be measured at amortized cost.

An amount of €21 million of the other financial non-current assets and trade and other receivables is
recognized at fair value through profit and loss and relates to derivative financial instruments. The classification
and measurement of these financial assets will remain unchanged under IFRS 9.

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has certain minor equity investments, which are currently
measured at their historic cost price. In accordance with IFRS 9, these equity investments should be measured at
fair value through profit and loss. The impact of this change is insignificant.

_Impairment model_

IFRS 9 introduces a new impairment model, whereby recognition of an allowance for expected credit losses
on financial assets is required, which deviates from the recognition of incurred credit losses under IAS 39. The
new impairment model is applicable for debt instrument financial assets measured at amortized cost, for debt
instrument financial assets measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income, for lease receivables,
contract assets, loan commitments and certain financial guarantee contracts.

As the IFRS 9 impairment model accelerates the timing of recognizing impairment losses, the
implementation of IFRS 9 will lead to recognition of a negligible additional impairment loss of less than
€1 million per 1 January 2018, related to trade receivables.

_IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”_

IFRS 15 replaces existing revenue recognition guidance in IFRS. It introduces a five-step model to
determine when to recognize revenue and at what amount, based on transfer of control over goods or services to
the customer. New qualitative and quantitative disclosures will also be required.

_Transition method_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group will adopt IFRS 15 as per 1 January 2018 and will not restate
its 2017 comparative figures. The transition effect on equity as per 1 January 2018 is less than €1 million.

_Sale of goods_

The vast majority of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s revenue is derived from chemical
products. Currently, revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards have been transferred to the
customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be

F-31


-----

estimated reliably and there is no continuing management involvement with the goods. For revenue from sales of
goods these conditions are generally met at the time the product is shipped and delivered to the customer,
depending on the delivery conditions.

In accordance with IFRS 15, revenue should be recognized when the customer obtains control of the goods.
Based on our assessment, we do not expect the application of IFRS 15 to result in a significant impact on our
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. We came to the same conclusion for the accounting treatment of
variable consideration, including among other rebates, bonuses, discounts and payments to customers.

_Service_

In certain instances the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group provides shipping and handling services
after control over the products transferred to the customer. Previously, no revenue was attributed to such services
and deferred until the services were provided to the customer.

In accordance with IFRS 15, such services are a separate performance obligation to which revenue should
be allocated. Such revenue is to be recognized over time when the relating services are being provided. The
amount to be recognized as deferred revenue and contract liability for services still to be provided after
31 December 2017 amounts to €1 million, after taxes.

**4** **Business combinations and divestments**

_Acquisitions_

In 2017, no significant acquisitions occurred.

In January 2016 the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group obtained the remaining 50 percent stake in EkO
Peroxide LLC, which mainly impacted the Combined Statement of Income on the line Results from joint
ventures as a result of the revaluation of the previously held equity interest. EkO Peroxide LLC was treated as
consolidated company thereafter.

In March 2015, the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group obtained the remaining 50 percent stake in
Delesto B.V., which was treated as consolidated company thereafter.

No acquisition in 2017, 2016 or 2015, individually nor in total, was determined to be material in respect of
IFRS 3 disclosure requirements.

_Divestments_

In 2017 and 2016, no significant divestments occurred. In 2015, the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group
completed the divestment of its Paper Chemicals business. The divestment resulted in a net gain of €31 million.

At 31 December 2017, the number of employees decreased by 1.0 percent to 9,700 people compared with
31 December 2016 mainly due to restructuring lay-offs.

_Share-based compensation_

Share-based compensation relates to the equity-settled performance-related share plan, as well as the sharematching plan. Charges recognized in the 2017 Combined Statement of Income for share-based compensation
amounted to €12 million and are included in salaries and wages (2016: €8 million, 2015: €10 million).

_Performance-related share plan_

Under the performance-related share plan, a number of conditional shares are granted to the members of the
AkzoNobel Group Board of Management, members of the AkzoNobel Group Executive Committee and
executives each year. The number of participants of AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group in the performancerelated share plan at 31 December 2017 was 220 (31 December 2016: 225, 31 December 2015: 232).

The shares of the series 2014-2016 have vested and were delivered to the participants in 2017.

As from the 2013-2015 series, the conditional grant of shares is linked for 35 percent to the relative total
shareholder return (“TSR”) performance of AkzoNobel Group compared with the peer group, 35 percent to the
return on investment (ROI) performance of AkzoNobel Group and the remaining 30 percent to the ranking of
AkzoNobel Group in the RobecoSAM benchmark.

The conditional shares of the 2015-2017 series vested as follows:

   - Akzo Nobel N.V. TSR performance over the period 2015-2017 resulted in a fifth position within the
ranking of the peer group companies. This resulted in a vesting of 75 percent for this part of the longterm incentive.

   - AkzoNobel Group ROI performance at the end of 2017 resulted in a vesting of 73 percent for this part
of the long-term incentive.

   - The average position in the RobecoSAM benchmark resulted in a vesting of 100 percent for this part of
the long-term incentive.

As a result, the conditional shares of the 2015-2017 series vested for 81.80 percent (series 2014-2016:
66.49 percent, series 2013-2015: 90.29 percent), including dividend shares of 13.27 percent (series 2014-2016:
7.63 percent, series 2013-2015: 7.96 percent), the final vesting percentage amounted to 92.65 percent (series
2014-2016: 71.56 percent, 2013-2015: 97.48 percent).

The share price of a common Akzo Nobel N.V. share at 31 December 2017 amounted to €73.02
(31 December 2016: €59.39, 31 December 2015: €61.68).

_Fair value of performance-related shares_

The weighted average fair value of the performance-related shares at 31 December 2017 was €52.42
(31 December 2016: €49.12, 31 December 2015: €54.11) and was for 35 percent based on a market condition
(TSR: 31 December 2017: €40.14, 31 December 2016: €40.20, 31 December 2015: €39.61) and for 65 percent
based on non-market based performance conditions (31 December 2017: €59.03, 31 December 2016: €60.96,
31 December 2015: €57.50).

The TSR part of the award is valued applying a Monte Carlo simulation model and the other part is valued
based on the share price at grant date.

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at date of grant (opening of 2 January
2017): €59.03, expected volatility: 23.94 percent and risk-free interest rate: negative 0.12 percent.

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at date of grant (opening of 4 January
2016): €60.96, expected volatility: 23.82 percent and risk-free interest rate: negative 0.09 percent.

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at date of grant (opening of 2 January
2015): €57.50, expected volatility: 24.41 percent and risk-free interest rate: 0.21 percent.

Expected volatility was determined based on the share price development of the past three years of Akzo
Nobel N.V. The risk-free interest rate was based on a Dutch zero-coupon government bond.

_Share-matching plan_

The members of the AkzoNobel Group Board of Management and Executive Committee are eligible to
participate in the share-matching plan. Under certain conditions, members who invest part of their short-term
incentive in Akzo Nobel N.V. shares may have such shares matched by the AkzoNobel Group. The investment in
Akzo Nobel N.V. shares in 2017 resulted in a total of 0 granted potential matching shares (2016: 855, 2015: 145).
During 2017, 1,676 potential matching shares were matched (2016: 431, 2015: 425), leading to a total of potential
matching shares at 31 December 2017 of 0 shares (31 December 2016: 1,676, 31 December 2015: 1,252).

_Fair value of matching shares_

As in 2017 no potential matching shares were granted, no fair value has been calculated.

The fair value of the matching shares was based on the share price on the investment date, discounted for
expected dividends over the holding period (31 December 2016: €59.43, 31 December 2015: €67.81).

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at purchase date of voluntary
investment (19 April 2016): €63.49 and the expected dividend yield: 2.18 percent.

The parameters applied for the fair value calculations are: share price at purchase date of voluntary
investment (21 April 2015): €73.45 and the expected dividend yield: 2.63 percent.

Net financing expenses for the year were €13 million (2016: €15 million, 2015: €16 million). Significant
variances in 2017 compared to 2016 and 2015 are:

   - Financing expenses increased from 2015 to 2017 by € 4 million to € 7 million. This is due to higher
interest expenses on outstanding invoices and VAT payables and due to additional interest expenses for
the loan entered into in China to facilitate the legal separation in 2018.

   - Financing expenses related to post-retirement benefits decreased from 2015 to 2017 by €5 million to
€12 million (2016: €16 million, 2015: €17 million) as a result of the decrease in interest rates over the
years.

   - Interest on provisions decreased from 2015 to 2017 by €6 million to €1 million income (2016:
€4 million, 2015: €5 million) due to higher discount rates used for discounting of provisions in 2017.

The average interest rate on total debt was 2.1 percent (2016: 1.7 percent, 2015: 2.7 percent).

The positive ETR impact in 2016 and 2015 in the line ‘Non-taxable (income)/expenses’ is mainly caused by
non-taxable gains related to acquisitions and a divestment, and by the impact of the R&D innovation box in the
Netherlands.

The negative ETR impact on the line ‘(De)recognition of deferred tax assets’ in 2015 is mainly related to
specific entities with loss carry forward positions for which no deferred tax could be recognized. Note that those
entities were subject to a business restructuring in 2017.

The negative ETR impact on the line ‘Non-refundable withholding taxes’ is mainly caused by
non-creditable foreign withholding tax on dividend that cannot be fully offset against Dutch corporate income
tax. The annual impact may fluctuate based on changes in (anticipated) dividend flows.

The impact on the reconciling item other is mainly related to adjustments in previous years and for 2017
also to the impact of the US tax reform on the measurement of deferred taxes.

_Deferred tax assets and liabilities_

From the total amount of recognized net deferred tax assets, €40 million (2016: €85 million, 2015: €79
million) is related to entities that have suffered a loss in either 2017, 2016 or 2015 and where utilization is
dependent on future taxable profit in excess of the charges arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences. For these entities, net deferred tax assets were recognized based on management’s long-term
projections and tax planning strategies.

The usage of the tax loss carry forwards recognized in the Combined Balance Sheet will affect the cash tax
rate in coming years.

In Recognized in Other comprehensive Income the impact of the US tax rate change is reflected for an
amount of €13 million.

Other can be explained by changes in exchange rates and Business equity movements as a result of the
carve-out approach. Under the approach followed for the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements, as explained
in the basis of preparation, the deferred tax assets for NOL’s and tax credits are not available to the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group if they are not contained in a surviving AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group legal
entity. Therefore, the corresponding balances are not included in the Combined Balance Sheet positions in the
Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. Instead, they are treated as capital distributions to the owner (i.e. settled
through Business equity) in accordance with the legal entity approach that is used for the Combined Balance Sheet.

A part of the future tax benefits associated with the pension obligations in Germany will reside with
AkzoNobel. Therefore, these tax benefits (€39 million as at 31 December 2017, €39 million as at 31 December
2016 and €31 million as at 31 December 2015) will not be realized by the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group and consequently the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has not recognized a deferred tax asset for
them in the Combined Balance Sheets.

_Impairment testing_

In 2017, 2016 and 2015, no impairment charges for goodwill were recorded. Several small other impairment
charges were recorded. The basis of the recoverable amount used for the business units disclosed in this note is
the value in use.

Goodwill is tested for impairment per business unit in the fourth quarter or whenever an impairment trigger
exists. The impairment test is in principle based on cash flow projections of the five-year plan. Elements
considered to determine if a different approach would be more appropriate are, among others, high growth/
emerging economies, geo expansion opportunities, introduction of new product ranges and opportunities from
market consolidation.

The key assumptions used in the projections are:

   - Revenue growth: based on actual experience, analysis of market growth and the expected market share
development

   - EBITDA-margin development: based on actual experience and management’s long-term projections

-----

For all business units, a terminal value was calculated based on the long-term inflation expectations of
1.2 percent. The estimated pre-tax cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax weighted average
cost of capital. The discount rates are determined for each business unit and range from 9.2 percent to 10.4 percent,
with a weighted average of 9.8 percent for 2017; from 8.7 percent to 11.2 percent, with a weighted average of
9.9 percent for 2016; and from 9.2 percent to 11.2 percent, with a weighted average of 10.0 percent for 2015.

A sensitivity test for growth assumptions (a 50 percent reduction of the growth rate), EBITDA-margin
development assumptions (a one percentage point decrease) as well as for the weighted average cost of capital (a
one percentage point increase) confirms sufficient headroom in all businesses.

_Capital expenditures_

We invested in several asset integrity and efficiency improvement projects while continuing to invest in
growth projects, such as increasing capacity of Expancel production in Sweden and building a world-scale plant
for monochloroacetic acid (MCA) as part of a joint arrangement with Atul in India.

In 2017, we completed the expansion of our production in Mariager, Denmark, which supplies
pharmaceutical-grade salt to the healthcare industry, increased capacity for sodium hydrosulfide (NASH)
production in LeMoyne, US, initiated production of organic peroxides in Los Reyes, Mexico, and completed the
plant expansion in Boxing, China.

In 2016, we officially opened two new plants at our Ningbo multisite in China, where Polymer Chemicals
commissioned the world’s largest DCP plant and Surface Chemistry inaugurated a new finishing (alkoxylation)
plant.

In 2015, several asset integrity and efficiency improvement projects as well as growth projects were
executed.

_Impairments_

In 2017, several small impairments and reversal of prior impairments were recorded, spread over all
businesses.

In 2016, a number of small impairments and reversal of prior impairments were recorded, which on balance
net out.

In 2015, several small impairments were recorded, spread over all businesses of which the majority is
related to the impairment of Paper Chemicals assets.

_Financial lease_

The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment financed by hire purchase and leasing and not
legally owned by the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group was €29 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: €28 million, 31 December 2015: €1 million) of which €26 million is related to Plant
equipment and machinery.

In 2017, we entered into new financial leases of €5 million (2016: €28 million), which were reported on the
line Other.

**11** **Investments in joint ventures**

Per 31 December 2017, the carrying value of investments in joint ventures amounted to €53 million
(31 December 2016: €54 million, 31 December 2015: €58 million). In 2017, the results from joint ventures
amounted to a profit of €7 million (2016: €25 million, 2015: €6 million).

No significant contingent liabilities exist related to joint ventures.

In 2017, there we no acquisitions or divestments in associates or joint ventures.

In 2016, we acquired the remaining 50 percent stake in EkO Peroxide LLC and obtained control. As a result
EkO Peroxide LLC changed from a joint venture into a fully consolidated company.

In 2015, we acquired the remaining 50 percent stake in Delesto B.V. and obtained control. As a result
Delesto B.V. changed from a joint venture into a fully consolidated company.

**15** **Business equity**

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operated and was managed as part of the AkzoNobel Group
during the periods presented. The Business equity consists of the owner’s net investment and the Non-controlling
interests. The owner’s net investment reflects the net funding position between the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel. The owner’s net investment comprises currency translation differences,
hedging reserve, reserve relating to share-based compensation, result for the period and owner’s funding.

_Funding by owner_

The contribution from (distribution to) the owner in the combined statement of changes in business equity
deviates from the funding from (to) the owner in the combined statement of cash flows due to income taxes paid
by the owner on behalf of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group.

_Currency translation differences_

Cumulative translation reserves comprise all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the
financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of intercompany loans with a
permanent nature and derivatives that hedge the net investment in a foreign subsidiary.

_Cash flow hedges_

Changes in fair value of derivatives comprise the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair
value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.

**16** **Post-retirement benefit provisions**

Post-retirement benefit provisions relate to defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefits,
including healthcare or welfare plans. We have a number of defined benefit pension plans. The largest pension
plans are in Germany and the US, which together account for 77 percent of defined benefit obligations (DBO)
and 65 percent of plan assets. Other significant pension plans include the plans in Belgium, Sweden and
Switzerland. The benefits of these pension plans are based primarily on years of service and employees’
compensation. The funding policy for the plans is consistent with local requirements in the countries of
establishment. We also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired employees, mainly in the
US and Belgium.

Valuations of the obligations under the plans are carried out regularly by independent qualified actuaries.
We accrue for the expected costs of providing such post-retirement benefits during the service years of the
employees. Governance of the benefit plans is the responsibility of the AkzoNobel Group Executive Committee
Pensions. This committee provides oversight of the costs and risks of the plans including oversight of the impact
of the plans on the company in terms of cash flow, pension expenses and the Combined Balance Sheet. The
committee develops and maintains policies on benefit design, funding, asset allocation and assumption setting.

_Pension plans_

Almost all of the defined benefit plans have been closed to new members since the early to mid-2000s,
although in many plans long-serving employees continue to accrue benefits. For plans in the US, the benefit
accrual is frozen and employees participate in defined contribution plans for future service. In countries where
plans are closed, new employees are eligible to join a defined contribution arrangement. Unless mandated by law,
it is our policy that any new plans are established as defined contribution plans.

The most significant risks that we run in relation to defined benefit plans are that investment returns fall
short of expectations, low discount rates, that inflation exceeds expectations, and retirees living longer than
expected. The assets and liabilities of each of the funded plans are held outside of the company in a trust or a

foundation, which is governed by a board of fiduciaries or trustees, depending on the legal arrangements in the
country concerned. The primary objective with regard to the investment of pension plan assets is to ensure that
each individual plan has sufficient funds available to satisfy future benefit obligations in accordance with local
legal and legislative requirements. For this purpose, we work closely with plan trustees or fiduciaries to develop
investment strategies.

Studies are carried out periodically to analyze and understand the trade-off between expected investment
returns, volatility of outcomes and the impact on cash contributions. We aim to strike a cautious balance between
these factors in order to agree affordable contribution schedules with plan fiduciaries.

Plan assets principally consist of insurance (annuity) policies, long-term interest-earning investments and
(investment funds with holdings primarily in) quoted equity securities.

In line with our proactive pension risk management strategy, we seek to reduce risk in our pension plans
over time. We continue to evaluate different potential de-risking strategies and opportunities on an ongoing basis.
Some future de-risking transactions may have both Combined Statement of Cash Flow and Combined Balance
Sheet impacts which may be substantial, as have some of the de-risking actions already taken. The cost of fully
removing risk would exceed estimated funding deficits.

The remaining pension plans primarily represent defined contribution plans. This includes, among others,
the Pension Fund APF in the Netherlands and the 401k plan in the US. The ITP2 plan in Sweden is financed
through insurance with the Alecta insurance company and is classified as a multi-employer defined benefit plan.

As AkzoNobel Group does not have access to sufficient information from Alecta to enable a defined benefit
accounting treatment, it is accounted for as a defined contribution plan. Contributions in 2017 were €5 million
(2016: €6 million; 2015: €7 million). Alecta’s target funding ratio in 2017 was 140 percent. The quoted ratio at
December 2017 stood at 154 percent. There is also a multi-employer plan in Germany in which AkzoNobel
Group participates with annual contributions totaling €1 million. The expenses of all plans accounted for as
defined contribution plans in the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group totaled €68 million in 2017 (2016:
€71 million; 2015: €60 million).

_Other post-retirement benefit plans_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits to retired
employees, mainly in the US and Belgium. The risks to which the healthcare plans expose the AkzoNobel
Specialty Chemicals Group include the risk of future increases in the cost of healthcare which would increase the
cost of maintaining the plans. In addition, the plans expose the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group to the risk
of a further decline in discount rates, which increases the plan obligations, and longevity risk as the plans
generally pay lifetime benefits.

In 2015, AkzoNobel Group modified the US welfare plans to align with local market practice. This resulted
in plan amendments and curtailments, leading to an adjustment of the provision of €47 million.

The equities and government bond debt assets in the table above have quoted prices in active markets,
although most are held through funds comprised of such instruments which are not actively traded themselves.
The other categories of plan assets include certain assets that are not quoted in active markets. Such unquoted
securities totaled €35 million (2016: €37 million; 2015: €17 million). Unquoted plan assets include investments
in insurance policies and high-yield credit strategies. Plan assets did not directly include any of AkzoNobel
Group’s own transferable financial instruments, nor any property occupied by or assets used by the company.

_Pension plans in asset position_

No pension balances were recorded under Other financial non-current assets in 2017 (2016: €nil million;
2015: €6 million). These assets could be recognized under IFRIC 14 because economic benefits are available in
the form of future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, either during the life of
the plan or on the (final) settlement of the plan liabilities.

_Cash flows_

In 2018, we expect to contribute €37 million (2017: €41 million; 2016: €45 million) to our defined benefit
pension plans. We expect to pay a further €5 million (2017: €6 million; 2016: €7 million) for other postretirement benefit plans. No allowance is made for any special one-off contributions that may arise in relation to
new de-risking opportunities.

¹ The sensitivity to price inflation assumption includes corresponding changes to all inflation-related
compensation increases, pensions in payment and pensions in deferment.

The sensitivity effect on DBO shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other
actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates the overall impact on DBO of the changes
shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ
between the different plans that comprise the total DBO. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency
and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for each plan. The
sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the valuation of the DBO under market
conditions at the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the
key actuarial assumptions may have on the total DBO. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability
of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent our view of expected future changes in DBO.
Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-retirement defined benefit
plans are not reflected in this analysis, as they would normally be reflected in plan asset changes rather than DBO
changes.

F-52


-----

The sensitivities in the table only apply to the DBO and not to the net amounts recognized in the Combined
Balance Sheet. Movements in the fair value of plan assets would, to a significant extent, be expected to offset
movements in the DBO resulting from changes in the given assumptions.

_Provisions for restructuring of activities_

Provisions for restructuring of activities comprise of accruals for certain employee benefits and for costs
which are directly associated with plans to exit or cease specific activities and closing down of facilities. For all
restructuring provisions a detailed formal plan exists and the implementation of the plan has started or the plan
has been announced before the balance sheet date. Most restructuring plans are expected to be completed within
one year from the balance sheet date.

_Environmental liabilities_

We are confronted with substantial costs arising out of environmental laws and regulations, which include
obligations to eliminate or limit the effects on the environment of the disposal or release of certain wastes or
substances at various sites. Proceedings involving environmental matters, such as the alleged discharge of
chemicals or waste materials into the air, water, or soil, are pending against us in various countries. In some
cases, this concerns sites divested in prior years or derelict sites belonging to companies acquired in the past.

Environmental liabilities can change substantially due to the emergence of additional information on the
nature or extent of the contamination, the geological circumstances, the necessity of employing particular
methods of remediation, actions by governmental agencies or private parties, or other factors.

The provisions for environmental costs amounted to €105 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December
2016: €133 million, 31 December 2015: €163 million). The provision has been discounted using an average pretax discount rate of 0.7 percent (31 December 2016: 0.5 percent, 31 December 2015: 0.9 percent).

While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of all pending environmental exposures, it is reasonably
possible that there will be a need for future provisions for environmental costs which, in management’s opinion,
based on information currently available, would not have a material effect on the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group’s financial position but could be material to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s
results of operations in any one accounting period.

_Sundry provisions and other contingent liabilities_

Sundry provisions relate to a variety of provisions, including provisions for claims, antitrust cases and other
long-term employee benefits, such as long-service leave and jubilee payments.

The majority of the cash outflows related to sundry provisions are expected to be within one to five years. In
calculating the sundry provisions, a pre-tax discount rate of on average 1.2 percent (31 December 2016:
2.1 percent, 31 December 2015: 2.8 percent) has been used.

A number of other claims are pending, all of which are contested. We are also involved in disputes with tax
authorities in several jurisdictions. AkzoNobel Group has provided various indemnities and guarantees in respect
of past divestments to the relevant purchasers and their permitted assigns (if applicable), which in general are
capped in time and/or amount (in proportion to the value received). To the extent such indemnities and
guarantees related to the Specialty Chemicals business, such claims were assigned to the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group and reflected in the Combined Carve-Out Financial Statements. The provided guarantees and
indemnities have varying maturity periods. AkzoNobel Group has received various claims under such
indemnities and guarantees. In some instances, AkzoNobel Group has been named as a direct defendant despite
the divestments.

Provisions are recognized when an outflow of economic benefits for settlement is probable and the amount
can be reliably estimated. It should be understood that, in light of possible future developments, such as:
(a) potential additional lawsuits; (b) possible future settlements; and (c) rulings or judgments in pending lawsuits,
certain cases may result in additional liabilities and related costs. At this point in time, we cannot estimate any
additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts with sufficient certainty to allow
such amount or range of amounts to be meaningful. While the outcome of said cases, claims and disputes cannot
be predicted with certainty, we believe, based upon legal advice and information received, that the final outcome
will not materially affect our combined financial position but could be material to our results of operations or
cash flows in any one accounting period.

_Current portion of provisions_

The current portion of post-retirement benefit provisions (€43 million) and other provisions (€73 million)
adds up to €116 million (31 December 2016: €191 million, 31 December 2015: €177 million), as reflected in the
Combined Balance Sheet.

_Discount rates_

The discount rates used in calculating the provisions recognized at 31 December 2017 are mentioned in the
paragraphs on environmental and sundry provisions. Changes in the discount rate will affect our combined
financial position. A sensitivity test showed that a one percentage point increase or decrease of discount rates will
have an impact of approximately €4 million on the provisions recognized at 31 December 2017.

_Long-term borrowings_

At 31 December 2017, 31 December 2016 and 31 December 2015, none of the borrowings were secured by
collateral.

Financial lease liabilities are included in borrowings and aggregated to €28 million at 31 December 2017
(31 December 2016: €28 million and 31 December 2015: €1 million). An amount of €4 million (31 December
2016: €4 million and 31 December 2015: €nil million) will mature within one year, €12 million will mature in
the period 2019 through 2022 and €12 million after 2022.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Short-term investments almost entirely consist of cash loans, time deposits, marketable private borrowings
and marketable securities immediately convertible into cash. For more information on credit risk management,

**21** **Commitments**

Purchase commitments for property, plant and equipment aggregated to €14 million in 2017 (2016:
€14 million, 2015: €14 million).

Lease payments during 2017 amounted to €68 million (2016: €76 million, 2015: €64 million). Our
operational lease portfolio mainly consists of leases related to land and property, employee cars, tank wagons and
other assets.

**22** **Related party transactions**

We consider AkzoNobel, key management, pension funds in which the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group participates, as well as the joint ventures of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group to be related
parties.

F-58


-----

We purchased and sold goods and services to various related parties in which we hold a 50 percent or less
equity interest (joint ventures). Such transactions were conducted at arm’s length with terms comparable with
transactions with third parties.

During the periods presented, we considered management of Business Area Specialty Chemicals to be the
key management personnel as defined in IAS 24 “Related parties”. The management of AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group comprises the CEO and the CFO. For details on their remuneration including the share based
compensation expenses of key management personnel, refer to Note 23. In the ordinary course of business, we
have transactions with various organizations with which certain members of key management are associated. All
related party transactions were conducted at arm’s length. No loans, advance payments or guarantees have been
extended to key management personnel, or any family member of such persons.

For related party transactions with pension funds, refer to Note 16. For receivables from and payables to
related parties, refer to Notes 14 and 19. For related party transactions with joint ventures reference is made to
Note 11.

An overview of related party transactions with AkzoNobel is as follows:

Higher brand royalty expenses in 2017 were due to the fact that the AkzoNobel brand royalty charge
increased from 0.5 percent of revenue (in 2016 and 2015) to 1.0 percent in 2017.

AkzoNobel Group uses a worldwide approach to its cash management and financing of its operations. As a
result, the related party balances between the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group and AkzoNobel are not
under common management of AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group management but under the management
of AkzoNobel Group’s treasury department. Therefore, no balances related to in house bank, cash pool and
intercompany funding have been reflected in the Combined Balance Sheet.

Operating income includes expenses that have been attributed from Business Area Corporate and Other to
Specialty Chemicals amounting to €187 million in 2017 (2016: €225 million 2015: €153 million) and are mainly
included in the Combined Statement of Income under General and administrative expenses and Other results.
The corporate overhead expenses are as follows:

The decrease in corporate overhead expenses in 2017 is mainly caused by decentralization of R&D and
Marketing functions from Business Area Corporate and Other to the Specialty Chemicals business units.

F-59


-----

The increase in corporate overhead expenses in 2016 is due to centralization of functions in Business Area
Corporate and Other by AkzoNobel Group which are mainly in Information Management function as well as the
further implementation of Global Business Services for Finance and HR.

**23** **Key management remuneration**

The aggregate amounts of remuneration of key management personnel during the relevant periods are as
follows:

**Total** **2** **2** **2**

Salary consists of base salary, short-term incentives, other short-term benefits and post-contract
compensation.

_Short-term incentive_

The short-term incentive is related to the financial performance in the year reported (70% opportunity) and a
personal component (30% opportunity).

_Other short-term benefits_

Other short-term benefits include employer’s charges (social contributions) and other compensations, such
as representation allowances, insurances, car arrangements and educational expenses.

_Post-contract compensation_

This refers to compensation intended for building up retirement benefits. The compensation is based on age
and is paid over the base salary in the current year and in most cases the short-term incentive related to that year.

_Share-based compensation_

The costs for share-based compensation are non-cash and relate to the performance-related share plan and
the share-matching plan following IFRS 2. Further details on the fair value of the performance-related share plan
and the share-matching plan are provided in Note 6.

As the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not operate as a stand-alone company during the
historical periods, the amounts presented above are not necessarily indicative of the compensation of key
management in future periods.

**24** **Financial risk management**

_Financial risk management framework_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group operates under the financial risk management framework of
AkzoNobel Group and as such the disclosures on financial risk management of AkzoNobel Group are also applicable
to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group. Please find below the financial risk management disclosures of
AkzoNobel Group as included in the Financial Statements 2017, where required tailored to the AkzoNobel Specialty
Chemicals Group. As the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not operate as a stand-alone entity, this financial
risk management framework may not be indicative of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s future framework
and does not necessarily reflect what its combined exposure would have been had the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals
Group operated as a separate entity apart from AkzoNobel for the periods presented.

Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value
interest rate risk and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. These risks are inherent to the way we operate as a
multinational with a large number of locally operating subsidiaries. Our overall risk management program seeks
to identify, assess, and—if necessary—mitigate these financial risks in order to minimize potential adverse
effects on our financial performance. Our risk mitigating activities include the use of derivative financial
instruments to hedge certain risk exposures. The AkzoNobel Group Board of Management is ultimately
responsible for risk management. AkzoNobel Group centrally identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks and
monitor compliance with the corporate policies approved by the AkzoNobel Group Board of Management,
except for commodity risks, which are subject to identification, evaluation, hedging and monitoring in the
businesses. AkzoNobel Group has treasury hubs located in Brazil, China, Singapore and the US that are primarily
responsible for regional cash management and short-term financing. AkzoNobel Group does not allow for
extensive treasury operations at subsidiary level directly with external parties.

_Liquidity risk management_

The primary objective of liquidity management is to provide for sufficient cash and cash equivalents at all
times and any place in the world to enable us to meet our payment obligations. At 31 December 2017, we had
€194 million available as cash and cash equivalents (31 December 2016: €97 million, 31 December 2015: €107
million), refer to Note 18.

_Credit risk management_

Credit risk arises from financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments
with a positive fair value, deposits with financial institutions and trade receivables. We have a credit risk
management policy in place to limit credit losses due to non-performance of financial counterparties and
customers. We monitor our exposure to credit risk on an ongoing basis at various levels. We only deal with
financial counterparties that have a sufficiently high credit rating.

Generally, we do not require collateral in respect of financial assets. Investments in cash and cash
equivalents and transactions involving derivative financial instruments are entered into with counterparties that
have sound credit ratings and good reputation. Derivative transactions are concluded mostly with parties with
whom we have contractual netting agreements and ISDA agreements in place. We set limits per counterparty for
the different types of financial instruments we use. We closely monitor the acceptable financial counterparty
credit ratings and credit limits and revise where required in line with the market circumstances. We do not expect
non-performance by the counterparties for these financial instruments. Due to our geographical spread and the
diversity of our customers, we were not subject to any significant concentration of credit risks at balance sheet
date. The credit risk from trade receivables is measured and analyzed at a local operating entity level, mainly by
means of ageing analysis, refer to Note 14. Generally, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the
carrying value of financial assets in the Combined Balance Sheet.

At 31 December 2017, the credit risk on combined level was €1,056 million (31 December 2016:
€927 million, 31 December 2015: €946 million) for cash, loans and receivables. Our credit risk is well spread
among both global and local counterparties. In regard to cash and cash equivalents, our largest counterparty risk
amounted to €48 million at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: €18 million, 31 December 2015: €34
million).

_Master netting agreements_

AkzoNobel Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) master netting agreements. In general, under such agreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on
a single day in respect of transactions outstanding in the same currency may be aggregated into a single net
amount that is payable by one party to the other. In certain circumstances—e.g. when a credit event such as a
default occurs—all outstanding transactions under the agreement may be terminated, the termination value is
assessed and a net amount is payable in settlement of the transactions.

_Foreign exchange risk management_

_Trade and financing transactions_

We operate in a large number of countries, where we have clients and suppliers, many of whom are outside
of the local functional currency environment. This creates currency exposure which is partly netted out on
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group level.

The purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the functional
currency net cash flows resulting from trade or financing transactions are adversely affected by changes in
exchange rates. AkzoNobel Group policy is to hedge our transactional foreign exchange rate exposures above
predefined thresholds from recognized assets and liabilities. Cash flow hedge accounting on forecasted
transactions is applied on a limited scale.

F-62


-----

The majority of our forward exchange contracts have a maturity of less than one year. When necessary,
forward exchange contracts are rolled over at maturity. Currency derivatives are not used for speculative
purposes.

These presented hedged notional amounts constitute of the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s hedged
notional amounts, which were hedged with the Central Treasury department of AkzoNobel Group.

_Investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures_

During 2017, net investment hedge accounting was applied on hedges of certain net investments in foreign
operations which were hedged with forward exchange contracts. During 2017, these hedges were fully effective.
At 31 December 2017, no hedges of net investments in foreign operations were outstanding.

_Price risk management_

We use commodities, gas and electricity in our production processes, which are particularly sensitive to
energy price movements.

Our Chlor-alkali activity in the Netherlands mitigates price risks related to electricity by concluding
electricity forwards to gradually cover the expected use over future periods. We apply cash flow hedge
accounting to these forwards. All contracts qualified as effective for hedge accounting. The fair value of the
contracts outstanding at 31 December 2017 amounted to a gain of €9 million, net of tax recorded in Business
equity (31 December 2016: a gain of €2 million, 31 December 2015: a loss of €20 million, all net of tax), which
are expected to affect profit within the next four years. All hedges were effective.

In order to hedge the oil price risk, we have entered into oil/gas swap contracts. The fair value of the contracts
at 31 December 2017 amounted to €nil million (31 December 2016: €nil million, 31 December 2015: a gain of
€2 million, all net of tax). We did not apply hedge accounting to the changes of the fair values of these contracts.

To hedge the price risk of electricity that is used for the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group plants in
Sweden and Finland, we entered into future contracts on the power exchange Nasdaq commodities through
Vattenfall AB, gradually increasing over time based on expected use of electricity over the period 2018–2022.
We apply cash flow hedge accounting to these contracts in order to mitigate the accounting mismatch that would
otherwise occur. The effective part of the fair value of these contracts amounted to a gain of €7 million net of tax
recorded in Business equity at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: a gain of €2 million, 31 December 2015:
a loss of €22 million, all net of tax and recorded in Business equity), which are expected to affect operational cost
within the next five years. All hedges were effective.

_Interest rate risk management_

Fixed rate debt results in fair value interest rate risk. Floating rate debt results in cash flow interest rate risk.
We treat fixed rate debt maturing within one year as floating rate debt for debt portfolio purposes. During the
reported periods, we have not used any interest rate derivatives.

F-63


-----

_Capital risk management_

The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group did not have a separate historical capital structure and hence, no
capital risk management is applied at this level.

_Fair value of financial instruments and IAS 39 categories_

In the table “Fair value per financial instrument category” insight is provided in the recognition of the
respective financial instruments per IAS 39 category. The total carrying value is based on the accounting
principles as outlined in Note 3. The loans, receivables and other liabilities are recognized at amortized cost,
using the effective interest method. The only financial instruments accounted for at fair value through profit or
loss are derivative financial instruments and the short-term investments included in cash. The fair value of
foreign currency contracts, swap contracts, oil contracts and gas and electricity futures was determined by
valuation techniques using market observable input (such as foreign currency interest rates based on Reuters) and
by obtaining quotes from dealers and brokers.

The following valuation methods for financial instruments carried at fair value through profit or loss are
distinguished:

   - Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

   - Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)

   - Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable)

F-64


-----

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables less allowance for impairment, shortterm borrowings and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity period of those
instruments and were determined using level 2 fair value methods. No fair value adjustments were made.

**Sensitivities on financial instruments at 31 December 2017**
**Sensitivity object** **Sensitivity** **Hypothetical impact**

Foreign currencies:


We perform foreign currency
sensitivity analysis by applying an
adjustment to the spot rates
prevailing at year-end. This
adjustment is based on observed
changes in the exchange rate in the
past and management expectation for
possible future movements. We then
apply the expected possible volatility
to revalue all monetary assets and
liabilities (including derivative
financial instruments) in a currency
other than the functional currency of
the subsidiary in its balance sheet at
year-end.

Commodity prices:

We perform our commodity price
risk sensitivity analysis by applying
an adjustment to the forward rates
prevailing at year-end. This
adjustment is based on observed
changes in commodity prices in the
previous year and management
expectations for possible future
movements. We then apply the
expected volatility to revalue all
commodity-derivative financial
instruments in the applicable
commodity in our balance sheet at
year-end. For the purpose of this
sensitivity analysis, the change of the
price of the commodity is not
discounted to the net present value at
balance sheet date.

Interest rate:

We perform interest rate sensitivity
analysis by applying an adjustment to
the interest rate curve prevailing at
year-end. This adjustment is based on
observed changes in the interest rate
in the past and management
expectation for possible future
movements. We then apply the
expected possible volatility to revalue
all interest bearing assets and

**25** **Subsequent events**

As part of the internal legal separation in January 2018, Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals
Holding B.V. entered into a Master Separation Agreement, including local assets and share transfer agreements
in various countries, whereby in principle all assets and liabilities related to the Specialty Chemicals business
were transferred to the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group with the exception of certain delayed transfers in
the United States, Germany, Pakistan, Colombia and Brazil. The transfer in Brazil was executed in the second
quarter of 2018. The total invoiced amounts of these legal transfers are recorded through equity as a
shareholder’s transaction with the AkzoNobel Group. Business equity was reduced by the transaction value of
these separation transactions in the first half-year of 2018. These transactions were not settled in cash in the first
half-year of 2018 leading to an increased receivable from AkzoNobel Group (€335 million) and an increased
payable to AkzoNobel Group (€1,356 million) as per June 30, 2018 compared with December 31, 2017. At
December 31, 2017, all positions to and from AkzoNobel Group were considered to be part of owner’s net
investment. The outstanding balance due to the AkzoNobel Group created from the separation transactions, will
be settled in conjunction with the proceeds from the sale transaction.

It is envisaged that the remaining delayed transfers will be completed prior to completion of the Specialty
Chemicals transaction with Carlyle Group and GIC. Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V. is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Akzo Nobel N.V.

In connection with this Master Separation Agreement Akzo Nobel N.V. and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding
B.V. entered into a number of transitional service level agreements based on which AkzoNobel Group provides
the AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group with certain services such as, amongst others, IT, real estate and HR.
Next to the transitional service level agreements, Akzo Nobel N.V and Akzo Nobel Chemicals Holding B.V.
have entered into a brand license agreement for the usage of the AkzoNobel brand and brand name.

On 27 March 2018, AkzoNobel announced that it had come to an agreement to sell 100% of its Specialty
Chemicals business to The Carlyle Group and GIC.

**_The basis for our opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our
responsibilities under those standards are further described in the section ‘Our responsibilities for the audit of the
combined carve-out financial statements’ of our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
opinion.

_Independence_

We are independent of The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group in accordance with the ‘Verordening
inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance opdrachten’ (ViO—Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence requirements in the
Netherlands. Furthermore, we have complied with the ‘Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants’
(VGBA—Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to rules of professional
conduct).

**_Emphasis of Matter_**

We draw attention to the fact that, as described in note 1 and note 2 of the combined carve-out special
purpose financial statements, The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group has not operated as an entity separate
from Akzo Nobel N.V. Therefore, these combined carve-out special purpose financial statements may not
necessarily be indicative of the results that would have occurred had The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group
been a separate stand-alone entity.

Furthermore, the combined carve-out special purpose financial statements and our audit report thereon are
intended solely for the purpose of presenting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of The
AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group on a stand-alone basis in accordance with the purpose included in the
above-mentioned notes and for no other purpose.

**Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit**

**_Responsibilities of management for the financial statements_**

The board of management is responsible for:

   - the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with EU-IFRS; and for

   - such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

As part of the preparation of the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the financial
reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going-concern
basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and
circumstances that may cast significant doubt on The AkzoNobel Specialty Chemicals Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern in the combined carve-out financial statements.

**_Our responsibilities for the audit of the special purpose combined carve-out financial statements_**

Our responsibility is to plan and perform an audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient
and appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a
high but not absolute level of assurance, which makes it possible that we may not detect all misstatements.
Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered to be material if, individually or in the
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of
the financial statements.

Materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of
identified misstatements on our opinion.

A more detailed description of our responsibilities is set out in the appendix to our report.

Amsterdam, August 27, 2018
PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants N.V.

Original has been signed by R. Dekkers RA

**Appendix to our auditor’s report on the combined carve-out financial statements of The AkzoNobel**
**Specialty Chemicals Group for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017**

In addition to what is included in our auditor’s report we have further set out in this appendix our
responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements and explained what an audit involves.

**_The auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements_**

We have exercised professional judgement and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the
audit in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. Our
objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our audit consisted, among other things of the following:

   - Identifying and assessing the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error, designing and performing audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may
involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the intentional override of
internal control.

   - Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the company’s internal control.

   - Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by management.

   - Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting, and
based on the audit evidence obtained, concluding whether a material uncertainty exists related to events

F-71


-----

and/or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report
and are made in the context of our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. However, future events
or conditions may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern.

   - Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures, and evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and
events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

Considering our ultimate responsibility for the opinion on the company’s combined financial statements we
are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. In this context, we have
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures for components of the group to ensure that we
performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Determining factors
are the geographic structure of the group, the significance and/or risk profile of group entities or activities, the
accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates. On this basis, we selected group
entities for which an audit or review of financial information or specific balances was considered necessary.

We communicate with management regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the
audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify
during our audit.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**1 – Business overview**

Starfruit Finco B.V. (‘Starfruit’ or the ‘Company’) is a private company with limited liability (besloten
vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands and registered
with the Dutch trade register under number 71194339. Starfruit and its subsidiaries are controlled by affiliates of
The Carlyle Group L.P. and GIC (collectively, the “Sponsors”) and have been formed solely for the purposes of
completing the acquisition of the Specialty Chemicals business of Akzo Nobel N.V. The acquisition is, pending
authority approval and employee consultation, expected to be completed in 2018.

**2 – Basis of preparation**

The consolidated financial statements of Starfruit have been prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC)
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements comply with IFRS as issued by the
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements are presented in euros (€). Amounts
are shown in euros unless otherwise stated. The euro is the presentation currency of the Group. Preparing the
financial statements in accordance with IFRS means that management is required to make assessments, estimates
and assumptions that influence the application of regulations and the amounts reported for assets, equity,
liabilities, commitments, income and expenses. The estimates made and the related assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors, such as relevant knowledge, which are considered to be
reasonable under the given circumstances. The IFRS financial statements have been prepared under the historical
cost convention. The consolidated financial statements of Starfruit have been prepared for the purpose of
presenting the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Starfruit in a prospectus drawn up in
relation to the issue of bonds in a non-public market.

**3 – Significant accounting policies**

The accounting policies applied for measuring assets and liabilities are based on the historical cost convention.

Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value and include all cash balances and short-term investments
that are directly convertible into cash. Changes in fair values are included in Financing income and expenses.

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the group has control. The group controls
an entity when the group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully
consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date
that control ceases.

Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies
adopted by the group.

The Company is heading the group and has a 100% participation in Starfruit German Holdco B.V., a Dutch
Corporation, which is fully consolidated. All internal balances and transactions are eliminated.

Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity attributable to equity holders. Costs directly connected to the issuance of
new shares are deducted from the proceeds and recognized in equity. Dividends are recognized in equity in the
reporting period in which they are declared.

**4 – Subsequent Events**

available to be issued. Certain other legal entities have been formed subsequent to June 30, 2018 to support the
acquisition of the Specialty Chemicals business of Akzo Nobel B.V. No other material subsequent events have
occurred that should be recorded or disclosed in this financial statement.

**5 – Other Information**

The financial statements are authorized for issue by the Board of Management of Starfruit Finco B.V.
